Its 1230 am Christmas Eve
Im out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin postin up with eggnog head upup in my cup
Put Rudolph in motion sleigh all bangbangin and coastin
Down the block but be careful for the hawk because its posted
Some stay to this day that Christmas aint nothing but another day
But out of respect I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me tell me where do the homeless and bums got to sleep  Nowhere 
Where do hungry and the needygreedies got to eat  But who cares 
Life is so crucial and cold as for for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams cant unfold
The young and old churches the spiritual dreams seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope fiends huh
Cause those who aint able get it now can finally get it
Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood now we ballin
Livin to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne haha check it  Yeah 
Santa Claus  Oohoohooh 
Is coming straight to the ghetto
Now on the first day of Christmas my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the Krazy Glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Henndawg and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything and it wasnt nothin but game to me
Back then you woke up to the sound of I Saw Mama Kissing Santa
Made you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts Mr Fat Man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil girls and boys
Pumped up I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin down my hall
Run to the window put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh aint no sign but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike that and this plastic ninell do fine til next year come
I try to see the same thing they got us brainwashed dumb
And when you find it aint no Santa Christmas still mean a lot
Cause its the time to get together and give all you got
You got food good moods and whats better than together with your people
Wellwishers give a toast by the tree its Merry Christmas


Santa Claus  Oohoohooh dont get too close because you might get shot 
Is coming straight to the ghetto  Welcome to the ghetto 
Santa Claus on the ceiling Jack Frost chillin
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Seasons greetings all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where well be eatin
Chestnuts roastin on a open fire
Singin my jingle where is Kris Kringle
I didnt pout and I aint even shouted
I even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my sixfour Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Aint that somethin  Uhhuh  Nah aint that nothin
How its Christmas time and my rhymes steady bumpin
Everybody happy  Happy  hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church house
Dont try to work me just stand in line and everything gon be fine
Holla at ya folks boy its goin down
Aint no help from no elves just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin out gifts blazin up spliffs
Christmas on the Row can you dig it  Can you dig it 
Santa Claus  Oohoohooh 
Is coming straight to the ghetto
Christmas Eve I believe 76 was the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky hella pies and cakes gettin baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait not tonight its straight beans and rice
On the table are we able to proceed tonight
I wonder what the morn bringin so its hard to doze off
Three o clock in my socks I crack the door soft
Hopin when I open the door Ill see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin with the boxes thats up under the tree
Look like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me
Now Im comin to see the whole picture gettin clearer
How we have less as XMas get nearer
Mirror mirror please its seemed Ive been deceived
And thank you Saint Trick for the gifts I received
So I creep back and act like I aint even peeped it
Thisll be me and moms private secret
Santa Claus  Oohoohooh 
Is coming straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus  Oohoohooh
