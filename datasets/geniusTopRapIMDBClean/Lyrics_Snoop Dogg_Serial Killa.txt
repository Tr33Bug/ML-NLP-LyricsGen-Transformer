Six million ways to die choose one
Its time to escape but I dont know where the fuck Im headed
Up or down right or left life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer you know what the deal is
Nigga you know what the real is
I see some off brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin Yo Daz whats up with the Pound
Is that nigga Snoop alright Ayo whats up with the crew
Is them niggas in jail or are them niggas through
I said If you aint up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name Dogg Pounds the game
Its like this they dont understand
Its an everyday thang to gangbang
Make that twist dont be a bitch let these niggas know
Whats up witchu I represent the Pound and Death Row
And cant no other motherfucker in LA or Long Beach
And Compton and Watts see DOGs
Now you cant come and you cant run and you cant
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need to put you to rest
Pump pump  Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
6 feet deep in fucking with the Pound is
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide


The cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Aint no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia oooh
Dont make a move for your gat so soon
Cause I drops bombs like Platoon  ayy nigga 
Walk with me hold my hand and let me lead you
Ill take you on a journey and I promise I wont leave you  I wont leave you 
I wont leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do thats when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open cause you dont wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your bustaass homeboys dwell well
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Now tell me whats my motherfuckin name
Serial killa Serial killa Serial killa
Wake up in the morning eat your Lucky Charms cereal 
Deep deep like the mind of Minolta
Now picture this
Lets picnic inside a morgue
Not picanic baskets picanic caskets
And I got the machine to crack your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal jagged edged totally roughneck
Now everybody scream nough respect to the X
Nough respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living
Word to momma Emma drama dilemma
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Now tell me whats my motherfuckin name
Serial killa Serial killa Serial killa
Wake up in the morning eat your Lucky Charms cereal
