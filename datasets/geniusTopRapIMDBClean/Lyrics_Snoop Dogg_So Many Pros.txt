So Many Pros Lyrics
Meet me out, can you make it?
Please don’t make me lie to you, lady
I’m in it, I’m not in it
But poochie say there's women
At the club we finna go
Sip some drink and hit some dro
It’s okay if you don’t go
I’ll make sure to tell you 'bout these pros
It’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees
So many pros
It’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees
So many pros
It's like somebody’s growin’ them on trees
So many pros
