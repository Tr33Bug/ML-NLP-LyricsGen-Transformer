A friend indeed
Feeling like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditate and let it ride
Rockabye beddybye
A friend indeed
More than jimming to
More than giving you
No prohibits to
You can have a listen too
I couldnt find no one else that I could give it to
And now that we on
I could put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And Im still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
Its not that Im dope and my style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said Snoopy dont you ever cut your hair
I was dazed and amazed
Thats why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
When I was in school I used to get cool grades
When I graduated used to smoke two jays
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco
Then I got a Caddy sack just like them vatos
Posted up sixone yeah thats the block though
Ride by slow and get your ass popped though
Me and Geeda Faith and Terry thats when rump was enough
Cant forget Tim Baby Dog and HalfDead
DreLoc was a 20 Crip that showed me a lot of shit
But moving along I went from a Camaro to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
Rolling through the neighborhood checking my traps
As you get old life like just might unfold
Cant settle this might be untold
Twilight Zone live life long
Smoke you a bone and hit you a blunt
Buy you a zo and roll you a jay
And put it in the EI
And lets stay way fucked up til we DI
All in together now if you agree
And lighters in the air repeat after me
Im too blowed forever in a day
I love for ohs so
Cause everybody green aint dro
Everybody cant smoke like we smoke
Give a dog a bone
I like trees that cypress hills grow
Roll up this shit pimpin its on
Stoners worldwide singing this song
