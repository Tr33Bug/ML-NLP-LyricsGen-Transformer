Poppin stoppin hoppin like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut retain myself
Think about the shit and Im thinkin wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner now Im on another
Mission wishin upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo no demo this is the real
Breakin niggas down like Evander Holyfield chill
Til the next episode
I make money and I really dont love hoes
Tell you the truth I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga the diggy Dr Dre
So lay back in the cut motherfucker fore you get shot
