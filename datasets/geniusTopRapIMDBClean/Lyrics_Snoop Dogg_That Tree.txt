Snoopy
Is what they say as if they knew me
Groupies on my head like a cufi
My nigga Kid Cudi thats my little buddy
Call some hoes up and get some cutty cutty
Whats your life like Mines is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin that china white
My people love me the fans love me Im all go
If you aint showin love then what you call for
I dont need it in my life my kids pay the price
So alike and in need of my wife
Smoke til Im gone Dogg on the throne
Im worldwide known Im a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it cause I can I earn my spot
You see the plan Im just fuckin with my fans
I turned out to be the better man important to life
You understand while Im puffin on this gram
Everything Im havin no there aint necessity
Though Im shining keep on grindin
What you see aint all of me
Though I keep them hos dont love them hos
The code in which yall roll
Its so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah 
I got my fam dawg look at my niggas
Got a little money yall and I aint trippin
Most days Im faded feeling exrated
Steady wantin freaky hoes then I want a lady
Holdin the fam down and my close homie
The peoples who were there when some sucka left me lonely
Phony when you see a nigga dont approach me
Made it to the top baby thats on me
Koch tryna claim that they made me
However you feel another real fugazzi
I keep it one hundred never frontin dont need be
Im in another zone no place you could see my nigga
Conyo to haters that dont know
Low pro how a nigga like from costo
The one fans love who was always approachable yo
And I rep the double O smokin eatin Cheerios


Everything Im havin no there aint necessity
Though Im shining keep on grindin
What you see aint all of me
Though I keep them hos dont love them hos
The code in which yall roll
Its so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah 
Cant forget it they made me who I am a king
And Im still on the scene you gotta love it
All out in public the people want to touch it
I need a blunt with the stuffin
Nigga its nothin for me to chill out post up at the house
With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies
Hollywood nice now everybody on me
And on the blogs talk shit like they know me hm
Aww fool take you niggas to school
How to get rich and stay cool
Snoopy D O Dub show you homie even with the critics
And the Feds all on me I was tappin all the chonies
Dogg but my folks call me Snoopy
Boss dogg nigga sue me
Pony tail swangin as I lay in the jacuzzi
Love of my life while Im puffin on the oww wee kush
Everything Im havin no there aint necessity
Though Im shining keep on grindin
What you see aint all of me
Though I keep them hos dont love them hos
The code in which yall roll
Its so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I cant forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
