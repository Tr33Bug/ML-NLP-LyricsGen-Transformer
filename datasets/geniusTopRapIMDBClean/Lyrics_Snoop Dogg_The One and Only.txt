Aw yeah coming to you live and direct from the LBC
We have the one and only Snoop DO double G
Yeah yeah drop it
scratching 
Its the one and only DO double G
Big Snoop Dogg its the one and only
The one and only DO doubledoubledouble G
Big Snoop Dogg
You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star
I push up laid back in a black car
Though I bossed up it aint hard to tell that
I came up hard as hell check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasnt getting along at this time
And since pops was gone Im out grinding
Catch a nigga praying swearing I aint going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa I dont know about this bidness shit
But Im good with this rapping can I get a witness whats happening
Thats about the time I put down the rocks
And got to working in the studio around the clock
For a small profit but a whole lot of game
Man Im famous now it aint the same
Its the one and only DO double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg bite em all yeah Im burning it up
Aw naw Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
Buck one buck two buck three buck four
So get real fool fool
Local boy made good over night shit
Not only am I getting righteous but wise see
I paid the price with consecutive platinum hits
I up my status aint no more Calvin Broadus
World on my shoulder but I can handle it
Now that Im older Im sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother
A street hustler but Im all set for the come up
Best kept secret so Im want up
Ive been acquitted up for 187
Yes Im blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now Im writing checks
And now the game aint stopping
And cant nobody say my name aint popping
Started off young as a littlebitty buck
Now Im ready for the world and I got to give it up


You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop look listen feel yeah I aint tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck Cuzz and him too cause all yall suckas
Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave new niggas a chance to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh a steady process
And leaving that way cause see Im blessed
Its like Im happy now cause Im a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
Its my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
Thats why I wear my LOCs at night nigga
