Why is there suddenly a nigga trippin when I do it
Why do everybody else gon have a war have beef
Within the music talkin about differences and its ok
Its music its hiphop its groundbreaking
When I do it its war
In the city watch how Im getting head with it
She do it with no hands and I be ghost whippin
Oops I think I meant ghost riding
When I get that vet watch how she let me slide in
In that pussy and you know Im the livest
Introduced known to beat it up no crime man
And I might leave your bae crying
Im so stressed out man all the homies fall in
And if she let me hit the homies all can
And nigga if Im eating its all in one pan
Cause Imma be as hungry as the last man
A young  but Im the nigga with the damn plan
I keep it G like a crip in the 80s
And man I beat your ass like a nigga in slavery
They say theyre trying to help me but it sound like hate to me
A young nigga but Im wise like Dr King
On my own shit get your own ends
Niggas think they gettin handouts cause we damn friends
Nigga put that spoon down better use your hands
Better get that grind right before you life ends
And I aint never had no love for a fake friend
Or a fuck nigga better duck nigga
Better hope one of them things dont get stuck in ya
Bbbbla  good luck nigga
Slip this with the crip stick
Itty bitty nigga with the slick shit
In a room full of misfits
Plug it in let it bang yea my shit bitch
Get bread like bisquick
Youre a soft ass nigga with a face full of lipstick
Let me show you how a crip dip
Get ships and flips and take low trips
I sipps that shit aint talking bout lean
Down to Mississippi and New Orleans
Word as a motherfucka let me verb that
Snoop Dogg is a hog yea I heard that
You deserve that swerve that lac
Make it bang let it go bring that back
I blew they brain nephew yea do that thang
Living life in the maze its amazing
So high I can levitate its crazy
I feel like Im the nigga in the matrix
Im sipping codeine I feel like Imma patient
I stay dosed down off a medical blunt this aint new
Cop a qp I blow it with lil Snoop
Blowing smoke out the roof hoes know we the truth
Get the bitch loose than I make her do what it do
Put the hole on the crew word to 
Im chopping real game other niggas is goose
And when I pass by the bitch she gon know we the truth
gang green and were devoted to you
We brought base in your face to proof
The realest nigga out bitch give me the juice
They never hate a nigga when he spittin the truth
I gotta keep it real gotta stick to my roots
TuTune in you know my slang
Me and my niggas doing our thing and we all gon win
Fucking these models and fucking they friends
Got more hoes than Snoop and Prince
Pimpin nigga look at my hands
Gold rings on my fingers
Young nigga and Im hella dangerous
Like a lethal injection ballers on it
Yea thats me section getting money
Yea thats the only objection
Chrome everywhere so I see my reflections
West West hold it down for Texas
Yellow diamonds on my necklace
Pretty bitches getting naked
Young nigga living reckless
Like 21 guns for protection
Been done with that fast life
So it was on to the thug life
Aint no bet but I could never love my wife
Like I love my life I never love ya twice
I fell in love one night still lost in the days in a major way
I be blazed for days like Johnny
Mobbing in the  lane its my hobby
We savvy real nigga say savvy
Looking for them bitches take them at a track meet
Deep dig bandit she run into my canyon
Dabbin blowing like a candle savvy
Woodgrain whippin in the valley
Real OG Im nothing like my daddy
Few kids on the way Im happy
Raw dog and Im learning with a passion
Ohh didnt yall go to school
Im reachin and preachin and teachin the youth
They all in my business Im feeling like Snoop
But Im more like Pac learn a life lesson but I might get shot
Im spreading the message thats all that I got
We pray for progression and stick to the plot
Im feeling like Yoda my knowledge is hot
I see myself changing the world
Because my thought patterns are so opposite of the norm
So I will have to change the world
Or I will have to be changed by the world
