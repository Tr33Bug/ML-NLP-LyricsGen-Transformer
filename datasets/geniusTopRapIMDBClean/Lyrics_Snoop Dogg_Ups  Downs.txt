Another dirty nineinch dick classic yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Girl as I sit here thinkin to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I think about all the things we been through
Like arguin and fightin for example
You know the love we have for each other
It tends to outweigh what we do to one another
You know my granddaddy used to always say
You know he used to sing it like this
There will be ups and downs smiles and frowns
Share with me fairy tales are makebelieve
There will be ups and downs smiles and frowns
Share with me fairy tales are makebelieve
There will be ups and downs smiles and frowns
Share with me fairy tales are makebelieve

Hangin with my homie from the turf thats young QBall

The niggas from Tha Eastsidaz split up  Split up 
And one of em tried to fuck your shit up  What 
Nah cuz dont believe that thats my nigga for life

I used to have a lot of broads that I dont fool with
I used to have a lot of homeboys I aint cool with
A lot of people that a nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin it
But wouldnt none of them believe it though  What 
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches Im getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
Cause we all gon get that day  For what 
To see if our life was straight
And see if well be able to walk through the pearly gates  Yeah 
To see the man upstairs
On some real talk homie Im tired of bein stuck here
If I could I would fly to the moon  Zoom 
Yall probably think Im trippin off these mushrooms I know

Now as I think back to the words my granddaddy used to say
I never seen him in church but he always had the word
He always would tell me Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
You got to do bad in order to do good
