W Balls Lyrics
(Radio Static)
That was the Dogg Pound here right on W Balls
187.4 on your FM dial
You're tuned in to the biggest balls of them all: DJ Saul T. Nuts
Aye, don't forget about my homeboy EZ Dicc and the Jackoff Hour
That's happening at twelve o'clock tonight
Right now we got some new Snoop Doggy Dogg for that ass
This one is called "Tha Shiznit"
You're about to go downtown bitch
Right here on the station that plays only platinum hits
That's 187.4 on your FM dial
If you're licking, that's W Balls
(Radio Static)
Everybody's got to hear the shit, on W Balls, W Balls, W BallsYou might also like2Embed
