Yo I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin a cheek
Dont try to negotiate I got burners to speak
Yo I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin a cheek
Dont try to negotiate I got burners to speak
I stand grounds flood blocks and lock down towns
Take over families execute em with live rounds
Hold grudges wear gloves no fingerprint smudges
So when in front of judges they have no case
Used to use pepper spray now Im carryin mace
Some niggas they think Im pretty wanna scar my face
But my life trife break dress codes and fuck hoes
Pop moles blow shoes leave hoes in doors
Come test that I spit rounds of four pounds
I leave town surrounded and drowned in slug sound
Fourteen buildings two casings seven floors
Thats Red Fern the home of the Scram Lords
Had temporary wars with Bloods and hooboys
I done cocked back the fours and put holes in doors a warrior
Yours look better Im takin yours
Stack Bundles no faking jacks Im breaking jaws
Yo I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin a cheek
Dont try to negotiate I got burners to speak
Yo I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin a cheek
Dont try to negotiate I got burners to speak

And the bitch she trigger happy so please dont tempt me
Ill make your whole family resent me
Yall niggas is dicks
Quotin Hova and thinkin you big pimpin
You and your funny ice grills and walkin the streets limpin
Crack money is tempin and rap money is livin
So Ima do me I aint never gon give it
Cause I been through all out wars and earned mine
Knuckle game tight son and yall scared to fight
Bet in Redburn you wont walk a block at night
You better have your chain tucked and your vest on tight
Yo I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin a cheek
Dont try to negotiate I got burners to speak
Yo I live by the code of the street

So if you can stand the rain then come outside
I aint only wettin niggas Im takin they pride
Takin they brides shake em down takin they pies
You dont believe that Im real nigga Look in my eyes
Speak with caution please take the proper precautions
Breathe too hard youll bleed like you had an abortion
I aint tough talkin nigga like Big this a warning
Promising one thing you will not see morning
Wont be yawning wont be tasting that stale breath
Go out with a bang and wake up in Hell depth
And Stack the type of nigga to wild out for nothin
My hand in my pants Ill back your clique down and Im bluffin
Only party out of town where chump niggas be frontin
Come to the club no ice but Im leavin with somethin

You know what the gun do
