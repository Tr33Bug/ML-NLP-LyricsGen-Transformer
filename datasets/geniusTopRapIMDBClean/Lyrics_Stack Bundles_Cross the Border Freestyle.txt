Volume three not guilty
Drastic Measurez
Yo
Uhhuh
Dinero
Came out flooded earlobes studded
Hood nigga all up in the jump all stunted
Hopped out the X5 marks in style
Showin off Hollywood red carpet style
Stick up kids dont think my guards is down
I wasnt a target then Im not a target now
Heres a message for you and your partners clown
Get hype I got guns thatll calm you down
Try and sneak attack end up on the floor where my sneakers at
Catch us VIP where the licks and the reefers at
Ballers ballettes niggas and seoritas at
Thrown shots of Bacardi Henny and tequila back
Even to the club I gotta carry the chrome
Get drunk til somebody gotta carry me home  Come on 
Wake up with a bad mami after we bone
And of course I wear condoms Im accident prone
Escape with my niggas to exchange in the Ford
I bet these broads never seen a whip with so many doors
Look like a high chair sittin on them five times fours
The inside look like a living room mahogany floors
Shorties all over like a sweat in the meccas
Even cop holes I call them the head detectors
They treat us like popstars brains in the SWAT car
Chokin on the dick like uh uh
Plus Im billingual quiero chocha ma
Not one chick told the kid no uhuh
Im the best thing to happen since soap operas
Thats why they pullin on my clothes like Dont go papa
Its nothin for the kid to cop MJs and chains
But Id rather cop them things and cock them things
Superstar man I pop them things
Leave brains on the dashboard and the windshield of your Range
Yall niggas is broke your fake ice dont fool me
I got shirts that cost more than your jewelry
Flip a few Os drop Gs on coochies
Thats why the groupies screw me in the movies
Yall niggas still got rollerblades
Im in the big body somethin on rollin blades
In the trunk is the gauge in the front two chickens
Big wheels rims eleven times two inches
When I hit the club find two new bitches
Put two bottles of BellV in my belly
Bag em jam up then come to the telly
Then I make em say my name like Beyonc and Kelly
And yall know the routine when Im diggin em out
615 now Im kickin em out
Dont get mad a couple hood niggas diggin your spouse
Its off my looks she dont care what Im spittin about
I like all my chicks talented sick with the mouth
Down to get crunk whenever grass thick in the house
Me and D hoppin out the six lookin crisp man
Watch look like an ice tray with a wristband
Two hands Mickey Mouse sit on my stomach
Small faces in my pocket cause I been had hundreds
And yall know Im holdin a mini microwave oven
With the dumdums in case niggas feel like thumbin
But I stashed the ratchet dipped in the latest fashion
Red bandana on brratin
Ask and Ill show you what Im packin
Poppin not flashin
Fuck beefin though Im tryna see what Im smashin
When I leave hatin ass bastards be askin
Yo how that fat nigga leave with that bad bitch
Cause they love Drastic
D domination Don V superstar and thats it
This a wrap bitch


The name Stack Bundles hoes call me Money a Lotta
She aint come home that mean your main honey I got her
In the back of the PT Cruiser legs up
Hand out the window finger at you slacker losers
Know cats like to act so I pack the Ruger
My team them same niggas slung captions to you
Now we young Gs gettin money South and North
With the snowy white stuff movin back and forth
Heres a jewel for you faggots who be mouthin off
You better save that last breath for later
Aint no comin back to life when your ass on that respirator
Mom sad but shell be glad you restin later
I done took a young wild one off the street
I lift you off your feet when I pop the heat
You in a better place now
Your bitch givin better face now
She lickin lower than the waist now
And Im still G walkin nigga I stopped dancin
Sick pair of custom yards yellow vintage
Tryna find a dime to face me off
And leave nut round her mouth like tartar sauce believe me
Stacks the boss I call the shots
Never cop from Jimmy Jazz only bald spots
Player blowin Gs in Macys I never thought it
And if it came from SDs a bitch brought it
Im a beast ass baller with a vast contract
Sacks not blower sixes hot thrower
Your bitch love Stack she top me like I know her
And since rap the chain been rocky like Balboa
And Im lookin for some mamis to cross the border
With some snowy white stuff in a fashionable order
Strap pies to her thighs and walk through customs
Straight ride for a gangster knowin they might bust em
Six four AustinHealey is how I crush em
Young G flossin daily cause its nothin
They dont know about the Cross the Border Freestyles and all that
The Grits STACK
Yall faggot ass niggas cant see me
Shout out to all the Grits Gang and all that nigga
