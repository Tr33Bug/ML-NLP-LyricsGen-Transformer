Once upon a time there was youngin bout his grind
There was mountain he would climb
And like a diamond he would shine
So they all took shots at him
They all throw rocks at him
And he aint stop he let em
Let em play they self out of position
Til he got tired of listening and put em in a submission
Its only one way in and out the Rock and thats through me
Unless you muthafuckers know SC
And hes too busy we gets busy
Come to kitty niggas spend it like he tryna get em dizzy
Is he Smells just like it
Youre tuned into the future I just made you psychic
Comes to the mixtapes Im the nigga they psych with
Shit and wipe my ass with the whole damn circuit
Tryna show Sylvia Romes and Sincere Pomes
The finest out of Queens since Sincere Jones
In the belly of the beast
Beast these boys
These boys reboy
Out in Perth Amboy boy
A New Jerseys not quite my style
Same old digital watch I just iced the dial
Wow said its not a face without a smile
Its not a case without a trial
A waist without a pist al 
Pistol I done pissed out so much Cristal
I could give these bitches a christening
Glistening only do it once in a blue moon
Im still in the hood motherfucker its too soon
Niggas is imposters
Scared of who I dances with the wolves
Im Kevin Costner
Gangstas get chubby and move to Miami
Try and midtown loft me and Porcshe Cayenne me
Is that God tryna send me a subliminal message
Is it a gift or a curse that Im blessed with
Well if I aint gangsta Im oh so gorgeus
Rap much better than em flow so flawless
Still living the life motherfucker Im lawless
And yall want me to give up all this
Maybe if I put down the clickclack
Take all this Versace shit back you faggotsll give me my dick back
Im feelin like Ludacris niggas get back
You ludacris niggas if you dont get that
