Okay Im reloaded
Jay what up nigga
Feel like  past this shit
And Im tellin you Ima do it my way
West side of the Windy what up
Our medicine
You know its no holds bars when homes layin these bars
No horse playin with broads homes made him a star
The stars made him a target
Cause hes the reasons fans are sayin his shit is garbage
And mines is much better
Admirin touch better with much more in advance
And nowdays Im lookin forward to much more in advance
Coulda been in the hood usin Desert for street cred
What I did for the game I gave the Desert its street cred
Me and the ATeam took the streets by storm
Group cosigned with the courtesy of the Storm
Now Im tryna reflect the tone like the tsunami storm
Tell Joe and Dame I get it I put the Roc on
CINCIA  the squad
Yall niggas oughta salute me
Admire the truth B you niggas aint got what it takes
The closer they get to the light is well bein a groupie
Ye talk to em
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause Ive been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye talk to em
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause Ive been on the grind and I stay into it
Like you cant say that Im like who the fuck said
Who the fuck made you Puff and who the fuck said
This was Making A Band What Im sayin should stand
A few rappers alive but the best niggas is dead
See Im the rebel that led the hometown to the forefront
Treat the game like the corner milk crate at the storefront
OGs had it poppin Im the blocks newcomer
My product is proper so Im doin my numbers
This shit is sellin itself but a few producers helped
Like Ye Dame Grease need a little search for self
Now this shit wont stay in the stores like its allergic to the shelves
And change wont change dude like he immune to the wealth
My presence is felt like braille oh hell
Its hip hops savior flow sweeter than that sherbets flavor
If you aint never seen a star wont you take you a glance
I aint lean back nigga I just pull up my pants and dip my way
Ye talk to em
Ye talk to em
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause Ive been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye talk to em
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause Ive been on the grind and I stay into it
I did it my way you can call me Frank in the flesh
When I do it I spew it like I was spittin it for Frank in the flesh
You cant imagine the triumph of an orphans life
Ive overcame the obstacles defied the odds twice
Met Ye in the Chi had a deal and all
Didnt work out back to the drawin board
Back to the hood back to the basics yall
Had to learn to cook  with raw no fakin yall
Always knew that I would make it yall
So the failure wasnt quite my style
Had to recognize it was light at the end of the tunnel
I see more cake like  with Betty Crocker
Betty rock em got me rockin
Crop you downs like  I came I saw
I keep my  and thoughts I pour
Leave you the Porsche the keys to the TOP floor
Either or
Ye talk to em
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause Ive been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye talk to em
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause Ive been on the grind and I stay into it
