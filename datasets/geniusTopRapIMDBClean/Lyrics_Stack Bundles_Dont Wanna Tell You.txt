Im only 22 years of age
It feels like Im goin on 45 from all the tears and rage
Tryna to pray to get my mind right
But being that I cant write a rhyme it got me feeling like Im fading from the lime light
This writers block thing is a bitch
Im like the rappin Barry Bonds they cant see me take a swing at a pitch
Labels want me to rap about money and jewels
Thats kind of hard when Im used to looking bummy and bruised
I cant even fill my tummy with food so how the fuck Im supposed to rap about luxuries or living the life
I never had shit but a few homies and a bad bitch that kept me up to par when my gear was looking past tense
Been stabbed and backstabbed so I know how the knife feels
Results of most insolence gave my body slight chills
Hooked up S5 hope we get a nice deal
And even if I do Im gon always remain Mike Millz
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause I been in the grind and I stay in to it
I made a vow to the Roc
Im on now Ima move units like we moved vowels of the rock
Its a crowd at the block and everybodys praising him
Cause they know where Im taking them
And if you fuckin with Bundles then they talking bout the boy
Trust me they aint talking bout the boy
Im bout to fill a rap boy rockstar
Gone both hustler turned mogul you cant stop me I told you
Yo this S5 shit is a movement
Its reality rap Im tired of being on the blocks with packs and bustin my guns and choppin til my hands get numb
Money makes the world turn so dont play with our funds
Whether you like it or not man We gon make it
It dont pop off then We gon take it back to the block man and it aint all good
And If I go platinum I can still come to the hood
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause I been in the grind and I stay in to it
Its been a lot time comin and I came up from nothin
Waking up broke and hungry I aint frontin
And the odds of me shinin its called grind
And I cry in a song shed tears when I rhyme
Its like yesterday I was just sellin to the fiends
And every nigga heard me rap was sellin me dreams
S5 is the team and the beats from Kanye
I get like Usher in the booth and do it my way
Still in the struggle tryna duck the law
Tryna calm down my nerves by puffin raw
Got negative ways but positive thoughts
Hope the judge dont remand when Im goin to court
Its reality rap and Im tellin the truth
Cant get a job the easiest one was Summer youth
And I guarantee its goin down once bitch touch down cause I know what to do you better know what to do
Dawg what you gon tell me
How you gon sell me
You cant tell me the way to do it
Cause I been in the grind and I stay in to it
