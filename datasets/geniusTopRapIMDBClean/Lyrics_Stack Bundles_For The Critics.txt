Dopeboy I told yall I can kill this track nigga
Raps makover the mixtape in stores soon man
These niggas is crazy
Heard these niggas say I was a mixtape artist or something
Like is you retarded
My song games impeccable
But the fans know what it is
Let me talk to the critics
Listen the critics is talking
They got questions
I got answers
Im not sick Im offended
I got cancer
They asking about the dancing I was a kid
14 I was getting about 1000 a vid
Dude crying in interviews they wanna know what he mean
Mad wife crossed over where the grass was green
Saying I stole from Wayne thats the name of his team
Squad Up got that shit poppin on the scene
Wanna know if Im a hustler or I just sell drugs
And I dont beef with faggots I just shoot thugs
Nah Im just pulling ya tail
Couldnt pay a nigga to front if he sang with Jay and Pharrell
En Vogue flow giving somethin they can feel
Even the blind can see its no need for brail
And um when it come to the Rock
Its no singers round here its no need for Rell
They keep askin bout the desert storm situation
Me and the ATeam still makin classics
Joe Cain Fab what up
Clue my dude wait till they hear that Lil Mo shit
Its nothin I got some more shit though
The Riot Squad is that gang
Holla at me 9174434820 man
Its all love
Im not glory hog I couldnt if I would
Fab made Desert Storm good
I just made Desert Storm hood
They had to block I supplied the Rock
In other words I just helped solidify they spot
Im not the star of the label
Just the strongest leg
Which makes me the essential part of the table
And though you mightve seen em on cable
Dont get it confused Cain made this able nigga
Not Paul thats my dude
Im talkin bout raw a lil nostril food
See the deal just gave me jewels
And the fame got me walkin around with this big ass fifth
Im used to matching
This dont coordinate with my fit
But I cant take if off my hip
Niggas wont think that Im hip
Like I dont know you sick to your stomach
Im winning and you dont benefit from it
The fuck you thought I bag the bitch and let you hump her
Its not the block I know you used to be a pumper
But this a whole different ball game
Young nigga Im not for games
That Glock will flame nigga
The riots that gang nigga
Drugs down to bang nigga
Gz and Bynoe feel the same nigga
Squad Up
The fans already know what it is man
Im appreciatin all the love and support Im gettin out there man
Yall see me on the corners Scrambler City holla at me
Look
Dear critics Im comfy Im doing well
Comes to the grooves for the ladies
Shit Im feelin as smooth as LL
And you can tell by my RB features
Theo negotiating Squad Up sneakers
Im as lyrical as Nas
As charamatic as Jay
Got his borough on lock like Big still to this day
As deep as Beans
As slick talkin as Kiss
One phrase to describe me
Im on my shit
