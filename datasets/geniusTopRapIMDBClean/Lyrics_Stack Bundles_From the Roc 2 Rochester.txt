You already know how I play
Real territorial
Shoot up the funeral
Piss on your memorial
Body something over them birds like Oreos
Black coupe white guts calling my Oreo
Yeah from the Rock to Rochester
Fool went Woolwich hide to Windchester
Theres no cuddle on the coke I move
Niggas tapping on their shit like they wearing dance shoes
Share a mans views Im principle driven
If you broken freedom whats the reason for living
The fiends coming with shorts but still aint need hard
No credit gassing for their EBT card
Its even exchange I even my change
And crazy you can tell I hit the B in the range
I put a bullet in the same hole twice
They thought it was dope of their plans like that aint you right
They speaking my name till they pop a vain
Spill wax on my picture
I guess they dont feel that Im a victor
A past to the bitter feed the dogs to cats in the litter
Seem like you rather chat with the chitter
Shit Ive been doing that since the jitter
But not on my nose buckle
I hit em with the shot of my phone buckle
Get em my own hustle with no one eats
Nigga my prime soul runs deep
I aint ready to go up creep
Nigga handy to take her on
To take em out
Every some wanted all
No squelch will raise a brow
Get pinched a wait a while
And while awaiting trial
You talk about the waiting style and how to make it style
Talk about the broken shortcuts
Instead he got hung and cut short
I got it with the door shut
See the three strikes a wash drug
Thats why I make it happen
Cant rely on rich chokes will fall up
Lost money itching the sands
While Im at the glitter and glands
The fam gotta sit in the can
If I get the rapping sister   the brand
Then Id be alive the players hitting the bench and
Hatters hitting the stands
What we die what we living for
Stack put prices on hers
Its bidding war get bread get in the door
Ive been did it before
Just try do it bigger homes
Live get a better home
Nigga I get it on
They speaking my name till they pop a vain
Spill wax on my picture
I guess they dont feel that Im a victor
A past to the bitter feed the dogs to cats in the litter
Seem like you rather chat with the chitter
Shit Ive been doing that since the jitter
But not on my nose buckle
I hit em with the shot of my phone buckle
Get em my own hustle with no one eats
Nigga my prime soul runs deep
I aint ready to go up creep
I aint tryna go up creep either nigga
Yo E Im about to come up top
Its been a cold winter down here
Come up there making snow we have a cold summer nigga
Them Riot Squad Boys in the building
From the Rock to Rochester
You know how the fuck we do it in the streets
Sqsqsqsquaaaad up cheeee
