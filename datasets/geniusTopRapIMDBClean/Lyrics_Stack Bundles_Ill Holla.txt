Im getting too much cash
Ill holla
Im living way too fast
Ill holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time aint now so love
Ill holla
Listen the plan is clearer than Smirnoff
Im tryna get these squares off
But groupie niggas keep talking my ears off
I tell them if it aint about a dollar
I aint got time to chat with you niggas Ill holla
Gotta be about kitty when it comes to stack
No pennypinching shit better come with stacks
I done sold more trees than a lumberjack
I done had more HOOOs than Liono from the Thundercats
The younger cats love my raps
Identify with a trapper
Ballin and he dapper
No wifey you could call him a bachelor
My broads got STDs theyll clap ya
An actor Im far from doggy
I smell something fishy and its far from porgy
Thats the scale feds tryna get a collar
I aint got time for jail so tell em Ill holla
Im getting too much cash
Ill holla
Im living way too fast
Ill holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time aint now so love
Ill holla
I I I Ill holla
Ma you got em open he looking like Ill holla
You tryna dance
He keep tugging on your pants
Ma please turn around and tell him that Ill holla
Holla at your guala
The top don dada
Pop my collar
Don when I leave ya follow
Homie one way to see if I gotta
Taste test mine dont waste that you gotta swallow
Nautica thermal with my chains on chain gang
Tavernati my jeans I do the damn thing
Without spring break I show the world how
Baking soda and some water make girl gone wild
Crocodile or gator either way they Maurie
Fuck em now or later Bitches all adore me
Mister twice son Im bored with orgies
Kiss the girl and make em cry young Georgie Porgie
Gorgeous gangster or whatever you call me
Take a picture snapshot record me
Im spending till it aint none left
Think Im stopping dont hold your breath Ill holla


Im getting too much cash
Ill holla
Im living way too fast
Ill holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time aint now so love
Ill holla
I I I Ill holla
Ma you got em open he looking like Ill holla
You tryna dance
He keep tugging on your pants
Ma please turn around and tell him that Ill holla
Hit the strip club blowin thousands of dollars
End of the night Im leaving with something like Ill holla
Try Prada Im MrRed Tag
Keep a bird by my side like MrMcnabb
She like stack they dont do it like you do
Skulls round my neck like Im practicing voodoo
Black magic a rabbit out the hat
Show you how to get a Carrera out the trap
These young boys dont spit it like Stack
They dont hustle they just be around shit like a pack
Its the youngin with the cocky flow
And in the words of King Jaffe Joe Ill holla
Im getting too much cash
Ill holla
Im living way too fast
Ill holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time aint now so love
Ill holla
I I I Ill holla
Ma you got em open he looking like Ill holla
You tryna dance
He keep tugging on your pants
Ma please turn around and tell him that Ill holla
