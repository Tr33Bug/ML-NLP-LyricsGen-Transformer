Love Dinero
Bout to get ugly in here
The streets are talkin volume four
Thats right
Feed your lil cock mouth fuckers
I hear you bastards Im comin for you
This Stack Bundles here you ready for me
I brought the Grits with me yo
Lets go
STACK
Yall faggot ass niggas cant see me
I cop goals by the dozen ask BJ
I got whores and they cryin all over me soundin like Freeway
Take a whiff yall can smell
And when I put it in the bag its gon give your whole fuckin block hell
I got bundles where your dough at
And the same place I piss from is where the whores gon blow at
No matter rap or crack I bubble like Moet
And its no coincidence Im always where your ho at
While you be prickin around Im gettin around
Throw a cock in her mouth and dickin her down
You shit in your hood I shit on your town
Im the best kept dog when Im luggin a pound
Get your chest wet shit talkin think the shit you poppin smart
I put more holes in you than shopping cart
The Grits post on the roof and clap niggas the snipe way
Slugs twist thugs and turn your jersey the right way
White gold gotta be kidding my dude like gray
You in the wrong division Im heavy you dudes lightweight
Son I cook the rock so hard it make the pipe break
Fiends cant smoke it at once you need a slight break
Rap niggas makin you dance and put your hands up
Im tryna make your paper advance
