Im just sitting here in the dark
I needed a little solitude
I seem to be lost in my own thoughts
Reality is chasing my dreams
My cries seem to be mistaken for screams
No trust in my eyes cant believe the shit that Ive seen
Follow my lead and end up in a place thats serene
Sirens ring in my ear
Night scenes teens everywhere
Pipe screens smell the fiends in the air
Light green when I stare
But Im still hoping to hear the same shit Ive been hoping for years
Sign right here
Montblanc John Hancock been ready
Thought itd make my heart stop feel my palms get sweaty
Ive done this on the date of my birth
Felt so wrong the shit made my emotions reverse
Had my heart beating fast as fuck had to back shit up
Settle down for a while thought I was acting up
Moneyll make you a slave lovell make you a fool
God paved the way Im never losing my cool
Understand Im a man cause of circumstance
I was dealt this hand so Im focused fam
Ignorance is bliss confidence is this that I am
Im Attila the Hun maybe a Genghis Khan
Black viking Im getting it on
My music has been right you was listening wrong
Young nigga try and take my plight
Punchlines is clever but you niggas cant have my synclavier
And thats why I flow so better you dont know no better
Never learned about money wont own no cheddar
Bet I learned about money at the age of 13
In Vegas doing my thing
Exotic gators me and my team
My oldhead had me at the by party with Jennifer Lopez
Spitting game like Gomez
Hair to twist way before I had braids I was trying to grow dreads
Bred by the thoroughbreds it aint hard to tell
Check my family tree what you expect from me
Papa got it in bricks Im a chip off the old block
And Im lost in the Rock
