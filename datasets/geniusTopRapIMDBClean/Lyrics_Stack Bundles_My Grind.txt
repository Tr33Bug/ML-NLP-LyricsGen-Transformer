Ay yo it aint no need to talk
Just know when I squeeze you wont have no knees to walk
I aint never gon leave New York
Im the opposite of Weight Watchers  Im getting diesel off
Move like I did time before
Got bread for the Feds  who said you cant rob the law
By all means Imma break the rules
Got cops on payroll snitches on interludes
Move coke through inner tubes
I dont trust no bitch so they cook mines in the nude
Make em strip like the Moulin Rouge
Fourfifth in the clip make the back of your medulla ooze nigga
Yous a fool I use the tool
Leave you in a blood pool the size of hula hoops
So you better warn you crew stop playing with dude
The fourfifthll cut em short like Daisy Dukes
Yall know who it is if not you better find out
Be eager to die show you what a nine bout
Fifty rocks bust into dimes what my grind bout
Thats what my grind bout thats what my grind bout
Compare me to smoking at the gas station
Im about to blow  you get it Im about the blow
Nah dog I aint about to blow  I been done that
Way back in a suede black Alfred Dunn hat
Your mouth you run that I gotta sit you down
Let a few rounds down where your lunch at
Clowns trying to come back
Dog you aint Mike
Even that dude cant get right
Im not that dude get that right
Stack clap two ransack back room get that white
Fiends wonder how I get that white
Cause I whips that right
Baking rain or gain or tool in each hand
Background clap down you and your man
Nigga calling me Yosemite Sam
Two semis in hands
Mac spit backflip have you send me a fam
Understand Im the boy yeah great
Bringing the rock back like we balling yay
Yall know who it is if not you better find out
Be eager to die show you what a nine bout
Fifty rocks bust into dimes what my grind bout
Players trying to pause the game need time out
Last quarter got more head than tails
In the street been in more blaze battles with shells
I dont need a team of Ghostbusters
All I need is a mean exhaust pipe on a muffler
Did I mention I started the rap tension
Aint no love so bulletproof your henchmen
Gucci rain suit for the jewels that Im drenched in
Fifth got a slick kick back like its flinching
Slide the clip in start to spitting
And I shoot clumsy  bystanders be thinking Im tripping
Used to ball in Chicagizzy like Pippen
Wrists every bit of plat is you know given
Watch look like its holding its breath
Wont be able to hold on when the bullets rip through your flesh
Motherfucker
