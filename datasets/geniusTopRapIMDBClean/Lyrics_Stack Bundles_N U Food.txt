Where Im from ns aint worried about the long arm of the law
They worried bout the long arm of the boy
Cause I can send them at ya broad day in the park with your boys
And have ns run upon ya with toys
Now do you have any idea how many dogs Im feedin
So many fucking red flags it looks like Im bleedin
But the Riot is the Gang Im leadin
That you motherfuckers best believe in
I flag green but Im cool with the boys in blue
You thinking cops but Im talkin bout Crips with choppers
Revolvers spin like propellors on helicopters
Tell your OG fall back I gotst this
You dont wanna piss me off

Ns better pray to the lord I make you call the shots youll be at war with the law

Thirty five poundsll take you a long way
Why you think the Riot Squad is as strong as it is today
My ns fresh from the yard
Been gone so long they dont know how to use metro cards
My young ns is worse they got stripes to earn
Playing tags with the system and its Rikers time
And they dont give a fuck about making a block hot
