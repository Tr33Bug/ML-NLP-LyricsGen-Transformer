Motherfuckers we bust guns like we at war nigga
We Patriotic we red white and blue
Got red Bloods blue Crips and white Cops
To patrol a motherfucker
We dont give a fuck
My nigga Stack Bundles
Come out here
Spray these motherfuckers
On the Streets of Far Rock
You cant trust nobody
Niggas will run on up you
With a hammer screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up
You aint getting that guap
Then nigga you aint nobody
From Redfern the Hammels niggas
Is banging screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up
In the Streets of Far Rock
Where Im from
First thing you learn is a gun
And how to empty a clip
Youll get ripped
You gonna need more
Stitches then a scene strip
While Im stuck in the mayor
Im fixing my fitting
Im loathing the clip up and
Walk out with it its that simple
You can tell I dont play with cake
Without touching it you can see the piece
About as heavy as a paper work
Getting raw far from work
Who just went up
Third came home dont even ask about bury
Im boss amongst bosses
Harry put them all in your face
So it wont be a viewing for the coffins
If dont make me blush its not an offer
And for the rush niggas like Jamals he is a offer
Far Rock is a different planet come around here
With your chest poked out its evident
You aint learnt shit from Janet
Went behind the scene is where the access granted
Your eye seen the body
But your stomach couldnt stand it


On the Streets of Far Rock
You cant trust nobody
Niggas will run on up you
With a hammer screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up
You aint getting that guap
Then nigga you aint nobody
From Redfern the Hammels niggas
Is banging screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up
In the Streets of Far Rock
Look
Everybody play a thug
Until you run up on a nigga
For his carrots with a shotty like Elmer Fudd
Then they play a different tune
Niggas soften up
And start singing for the bitches like Loon
You aint got to take my words for its your
You dont know what StJohns is nigga the 4th
Put them in intensive care
Fucked up how he was riding in a Bentley
Now he rolling in an expensive chair
You aint really from the streets nigga
Then dont pretend to be
Range the terrible thing to waste
Ask the Kennedys
Got an unforgettable face
They dont remember me
Young nigga that let his thing smoke like a chimney
Patience is a virtue and I aint got a PhD
So PH on SB and Im a hurt you
I cant even beef with these bitches
They too commercial
And if you got hot when I signed
That mean I birthed you
On the Streets of Far Rock
You cant trust nobody
Niggas will run on up you
With a hammer screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up
You aint getting that guap
Then nigga you aint nobody
From Redfern the Hammels niggas
Is banging screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up
In the Streets of Far Rock
