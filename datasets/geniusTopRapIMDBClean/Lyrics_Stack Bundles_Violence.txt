Violence is the way that disarms the opponent  It exposes his moral defenses it weakens his morale  And at the same time it works on his conscience and he just doesnt know how to handle it  If he doesnt beat you wonderful And even if he beats you you develop the quiet courage of accepting blows without retaliating  If he doesnt put you in jail wonderful  Nobody with any sense loves to go to jail
We in my hood
Green whattup
You know what the fuck I do man
Ssssssquad up
From the last stop of the ATrain
Where Ds hop outta them vans like they the ATeam
And young bulls spray things
Niggas smoke purple but they all love Black
Its wolves in every circle and they all love Stack
Where the rappers get robbed hustlers on they job
And niggas got their first packs listening to the Mobb
Drink Away The Pain was your favorite song
The party shot the fuck up when Shook Ones come on
From Farrock America 20 Minutes from Queens
30 Minutes from Brooklyn somewhere in between
Where we call em custies and yall call em fiends
Hoppin outta fifty thousand dollar cars at 17
Where niggas take it to trial and stand in front of the jury
And count on one hand that meanin niggas wearin jewelery
Where niggas came up but none of em claims em
So when you mention Farrock nigga say my name
Say my gang  Sssquad up  my slogan
Give a fuck about your war scars niggas is lames
Only real niggas came to the hood was WuTang
They got out the car and stood in the projects
Other niggas woulda got killed in the process
You woulda been food my stomachll digest
Its that simple and Im that thorough
Only youngin in New York can say own his whole borough
Execs tryna to sell me dreams Im not buyin it
They fuckin my around in the draft like Matt Leinart
Shoulda went first like Reggie Bush
They all wonder if I really got Capo push
My motto Look gangsta also gorgeous
And everytime you hear him the flow so flawless
Bright lights bright city
Rock star in the nightlife of New Yiddy New York New York
Gotta learn to speak the lingo talk the talk
Cuz look Farrock different all blocks different
Twentys a threefour no one stop clickin
Redfern essential niggas still gettin it
GWay crippin Edgemere drippin
Hammels niggas still get in bricks
Come to bitches we got chickens in video vids
From Ruger poppin Rockaway
Nigga empty ya clip
