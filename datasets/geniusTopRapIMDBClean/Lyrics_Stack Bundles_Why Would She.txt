Have her admiring things that Im copping
Yes sir
Have her open up the bling bling rock em
Have her head bobbin to tunes that Im knockin

You took her out let her window browse
I let her spend in Chanel
Let her dine in M chows
Got a love him style
Smell the angel all on her blouse
Polka dot two tops like Minnie mouse
Oh girl on some girly shh

But your relationship open and shh
