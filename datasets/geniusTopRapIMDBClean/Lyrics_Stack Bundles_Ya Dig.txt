Yo
Get on the fuck from round me I dont care what Ps he hangin
I never heard of him so tell him to keep bangin
My ns is riders its strength in numbers
Whether six or that five its gangsters among us
I got the hood in a frenzy they see how he
Open them suicide doors on that CLE

Shoe game marvelous heavy on his charming wrist
You aint got the heart to risk ya life for ya lifestyle
Pay to get acquitted for the charges like Mike Trout

Gorgeous gangster around just follow the hoes
They all juicy sweatin em believe em flattered
But when they start in five like mine your bench dont matter
Tints dont matter they know who that car belongs to
