Yall Niggas Is Trash  Ali Vegas diss  Lyrics
If you aint Riot Squad
You shouldnt say that
Screaming that Squaaad Up
And get you shot
When I met you with L Odom
You was a bitch
Got with that has beens offspring
Now both of yall on my dick well
Its to late fam
The young dons buzzing like Intercoms already
And yall niggas is trash
I am trying to understand
I guess your Nas and hes Jay
Or hes 50 and your A
Well that whole shit is gay
And not adding up
I am tired of doing the math
Yall niggas is trash
Yous a disgrace to 40
Far from a hoodlum
My half shan a hoodlum
Come back to your hood
And finish what he started
And you came crying to me with your soft ass
Yall niggas is trash
And Fab got your little man bitter
So now hes Matolas new bitch
Like Mariah in glitter
And his boss a snitch we aint forget
We not letting it pass
Yall niggas is trash
You call yourself the pony
So watch how horse the game
Got my folks who got lost in it mane
You missed your generation
And I am leading this one
I am feasting while yall fast
Yall niggas is trash
Your not apart of my circle
So when I knock start the square
Not a chance niggas Im still here
Saying my name on these tapes
Is only free promotion and getting me more ass
Yall niggas is trash
You niggas screaming Southside
But youre soft and wont ride
Dont matter what yall do
Clue aint fucking with you
And seeing you with my mans
So dont bit to him and feed you
I know you mad
Yall niggas is trash
I am still repping the rock
The Riot we Squaaaad up
And no matter the block
We fucking the Squaaaad up
But I aint in to the threats
I am still screaming city
You feeling gully then see me
Yall niggas is trash
