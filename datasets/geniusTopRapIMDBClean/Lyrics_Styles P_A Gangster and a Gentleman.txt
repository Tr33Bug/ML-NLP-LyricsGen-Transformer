Yes pay full attention
This is for gangstas this is for gentlemen
Theres two kind of people out there
I happen to be the boss type
Im a product of my environment
Blame the streets I am what they made me
My pops came from BedStuy my mom came from Africa
Im all nigga if you know what I mean
They hooked up in the 70s when liquor and weed was heavy
And had me in Corona Queens
By the time I was seven my mom left my pop
Then we moved to the south side of Yonkers New York
Then my mom remarried had my little brother Gary
My sister a year later let me gather my thoughts
By the time I was nine I was outta my mind
My step pops didnt like me beat me outta my mind
Ten and eleven the same I never would change
He still had to hit me aggravate a little nigga
Still wearin Skippys
Garf had Adidas and Pumas I coulda had a pair
But Mommy said wait til Christmas but I needed em sooner
If you heard I was broke dawg it wasnt a rumor
I said Gangstas ride  Ride with me 
Gentlemen live your life  Live it up 
Cause Gangstas die  We all gon die 
Its only a matter of time  The clock tickin 
It was 1986 and I was twelve years old
Thats right around the time when crack came out
It was the best thing that happened to me
I swear to God cause I was gettin everything that I was askin about
First we started off baggin up me and Garf
Then shit start addin up we gettin smart
Now we on Broadway coppin our own base
Bring it home and put it in bottles sit in Serato
Drink an OE and scramble like it wasnt tomorrow
Im gettin kicked out of Junior High thinkin Im grown
Garf bust with the yellow rabbit
And I had every color Delt we was gettin it on
I was out robbin Mexicans six in the morn
Mom said I had a F again riffin Im gone
Nigga get a little looted and grown soup in the dome
Fuck me up worst when I went to the group home
I said Gangstas ride  Ride with me 
Gentlemen live your life  Live it up 
Cause Gangstas die  We all gon die 
Its only a matter of time  The clock tickin 
Im leavin out a lotta shit nigga its too real
My alcoholic backround the welfare motels
Abuse that I had to take struggle at my moms recruit
How the fuck Im gon bond wit you
And the cases I got up to date told you that I bust a eight
Got niggas I cant name outta state niggas fuck with weight
Little brother gone but I got a baby angel
You fuckin with a dirty name dont let these niggas change you
The presents what you get
And the past is what make the man future
I cant tell you I aint God or lil Superman
No there aint a S on my chest but its a D on my block  DBlock 
Cause in life the deepest lesson is death
Im determined and Im disciplined and destined to rest
Im a Gangsta and a Gentleman Panero the best
When I pass Im like gas motherfuckers
Cause Im a leave a stain that youll never forget
I said Gangstas ride  Ride with me 
Gentlemen live your life  Live it up 
Cause Gangstas die  We all gon die 
Its only a matter of time  The clock tickin 
This gangsta and this gentleman shit is about being humble
But at the same time let niggas know whats real
And when I say you real I could flip
But at the same time I could talk to a nigga at the same time
If he dont respect that then you gotta show em youre gangsta
He respect that you show em youre gentleman
Cause you respect him as a man
Thats what a gangsta and a gentleman is about
