Pain
All I know is pain all I seen is death
Couple homies and brother gone when Im gon step
I aint suicidal damn my brain need rest
Think about my childhood pain in my chest
Past is the past future aint great
All right in the hood when any day could be my last
Pop something back they wanna sue me for my math
Hawk some back they wanna sue me for my math
Hard bein a gangsta rapper you dont know the half
You aint got to condone it but you was never homeless
And you aint never fast so you dont know the wrath
To taking a long walk down the wrong path
All I know is pain everything I did wrong
I did it in vain thats why Im tryna change
Live for my seeds but the game aint change
Only the strong survive I will maintain
All I know is pain all I get is pain
All I give is pain all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
Its no love ice cold blood running all through my veins 
All I know is pain all I get is pain
All I give is pain all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
Its more than rhymes more shine than the diamonds on your chain 
What you know about pain
Blood sweat and tears where Im standing in the rain
If I dont blow Mary Jane Im going insane
Before I had a car I was in the fast lane
Drugdealing stick up kid for the neck game a lot that I regret
But I made it as a rapper and its not what I expect
For a fact this business is more crooked
The boysll sell they souls to the devil the Lord looking
See in you hell just in case that we all cooking
I got sins too lot of foul shit that I been through
The world is God house Im just a window pane
Tryna maintain up to the end yo
All I know is pain all I get is pain
All I give is pain all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
Its no love ice cold blood running all through my veins 
All I know is pain all I get is pain
All I give is pain all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
Its more than rhymes more shine than the diamonds on your chain 
All I know is pain I feel so drained
Rap niggas is insane they on Procaine
What they call hot I would call so lame
They dont care about the art and they show no shame
If you aint getting spins then you aint gon win
But if you came from the bottom you should stay going in
The Ghost dont make it then the Phantom gon win
Ima make the kids richer make grandma grin
All I know is pain all I get is pain
All I give is pain all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
Its no love ice cold blood running all through my veins 
All I know is pain all I get is pain
All I give is pain all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
Its more than rhymes more shine than the diamonds on your chain
