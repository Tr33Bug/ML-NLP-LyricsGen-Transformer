Alone in the street
Aalone in the street
Aalone in the street
You fuckin with my soul right here
All night
I dont really care what I sell or what I sold
As long as I give my soul whenever my story told
I dont know how you roll but I roll all alone
In the zone knowin damn well my little brother home
Still feel him in the passenger seat
I cant see him and I wish that he can chatter with me
In due time until then you can say I got more than a few rhymes
Thought Id be there to see him like more than a few times
Tryin to stay away from beef but shit is gettin deep
I aint restin right its like Im on layaway for sleep
I think I shoulda been a author or somethin
Disappear like Hoffa or somethin came back when they offer me somethin
My word I got a little crust in my third eye
Headaches why I be meditatin thoughts is devastatin
Could this be my last life Maybe my past life
Is the future when Im sleep So what was last night
Im goin in deep  and you know the Ghost
Alone in the street One two three four
5 oclock in the mornin you know Im tryin to see more
Alone in the street All day all night
All by myself you know that Im all right
Alone in the street Seven eight nine ten eleven
12 PM you know Im tryin to get it in
Alone in the street All day all night
Mad live could learn to bounce out on a bad vibe
Or either keep a gun in your cab ride
Have I thought about my life as a bad guy
Made a little money sellin rocks that was capsized
Robbed a lot of people like I never was baptized
Yeah I was a very young teen when I took my shahadah
But got right off my deen when I could book the Ramada
Cause Id rather be a robber or a midnight marauder
Theres a part of me that love bein gangster all of me
I couldnt help but get in the game the shit was callin me
And I think that I was callin it back
But you cant help but trip when you fall in the trap
If the Lord call who got the phone for callin him back
Things are manmade why dont you tell man to do that
But he cant so Imma stay on the spiritual flack
Cause its a uphill battle when Im dealin with that


Consider this a sermon start to burnin
Never said you was hard I aint give you the permit
I might think you vermin better yet vomit
Alone in the streets with the gun by the armpit
Cant put a shark with a pawn fish its conflict
Sorta like mixin boy scouts with the convicts
Somebody gon pay if somebody gon play
Cause the streets coldhearted on a hot summer day
If you gon rap please stop run away
Go home flush ya crack then give ya gun away
Cause the rules is written down in invisible ink
Just consider what the critical think
Dont rat do your bid in the clink stand tall lil boy
Get yourself a shrink if youre feelin youre paranoid
But real talk fuck jail talk I know homes sweet
Even locked down in a cage is where your dome be
echoes at the end
