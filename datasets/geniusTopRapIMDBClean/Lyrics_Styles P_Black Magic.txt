You
Wha wha yeah  yeah 
Its like a team over here daddy
One for all and one for one you know
Let it flow flow flow ahh yeah 
If it aint that then it aint right
If you be knowin that youll be aight
My heart goes out to the homeless and poor
And my niggas in the bing that didnt go to the board
Wit a 25 to L on your back the shit is too cold
And for the kids that didnt get they school clothes
For the gods that lost they earth
The worlds a song youll get it back you just lost your verse
Its P verse the demons thats why Im feenin for weed
Cuz I dont wanna forfeit first
I could even bust my gun and do some office work
But I still wanna off this jerk  shit 
I cant leave it out my rhymes  why 
Cuz it be part of my dreams to see 20 porsches murk
Three houses for the family two for the niggas
When I die I was true to the niggas  True soldier 
And I never practice voodoo
But its like Black Magic how I spit this fluid to niggas
How do you move on this way
When taking all this stress and pain
Theres gotta be a better way
Theres gotta be a better way yeah
If I should give up hope today
P wont you help me find my way
All I really want
Is to live my life so we can just get high yeah yeah
Ask God when he stoppin the pain
A fiend got a shoelace on his arm and he poppin his vein
And the needle look dirty but Im close to reaching 30
And the only thing I know its a profit to gain
I might cry but Im still cold
I might be cold but I still cry
And bottom line Ima still die
I can see the doors openin now
I can see the ghost floatin around
Thats why P come down with the potenest sound
Spit the shit thatll open the ground  crack the ground 
My third eye got a horoscope  I see it all 
So if you wanna know my horoscope listen to the bars I wrote
Build and destroy
Come through the strip wit bricks of the girl and keys of the boy
Cuz all I really want  what 
Was a gun and blunt a lil money and some keys to a toy
How do you move on this way
When taking all this stress and pain
Theres gotta be a better way
Theres gotta be a better way yeah
If I should give up hope today
P wont you help me find my way
All I really want
Is to live my life so we can just get high yeah yeah
My whole life been a sacrifice
So if my nigga need my help he aint never gotta ask me twice
Im the nigga you could kick it wit
You gotta spot you wanna rob Im the nigga you could stick it wit
Im in the studio Im droppin pain on the beat
Im famous indeed but those is two differences
They tryin to understand me but I overstand em
Im the flowin phantom til we blowin random
To my corner niggas holdin cannons
That want the money and jewels and everything cuz we so demanding
To the hoes that think Im handsome
That know a gangster when she see one ma yeah money thats the anthem
Callin niggas like thats the ransom
You could take em you could leave em but your man aint a happy camper
If P flowin then thats the cancer
Holiday the hottest shit point blank dawg thats the answer
How do you move on this way
When taking all this stress and pain
Theres gotta be a better way
Theres gotta be a better way yeah
If I should give up hope today
P wont you help me find my way
