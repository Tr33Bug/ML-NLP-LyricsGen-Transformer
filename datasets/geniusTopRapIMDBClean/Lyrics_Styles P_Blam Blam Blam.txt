Yeah
LOX
I got em
Machine baby
Look
Word to the coke that in my shooter nose  Sniff 
Beluga 20s in the coupe I drove
On the stoop in the cold movin stupid Os
Whip the fish before it even dried deuce was sold
Take a half produce a whole when I use the stove
Went from trappin in Pelle jackets to rockin Gucci clothes
Thats why when you see me Im with a group of hoes
Bad bitches that look like Karrueche Im used to those
Bal Harbor shoppin my pockets do be swole
Cubans gold
Put my knife in your body remove your soul
Use your homie shirt to wipe my knife off
His blood splattered on my Kith Moncler I stabbed him twice more
The fuck Im takin your advice for
When they cut mama lights off I started sellin white soft
Its ironic the nigga they tried to write off was takin the league by storm Im kinda like Moss
Wake up in the mornin to a blunted sour
Then Im up in lust Im makin money shower
You got money and respect then you got fuckin power
Im rich but I clap a nigga over a hundred dollars
Where Im from you keep the hammer tucked
Niggas is foul fuck around and get your nana bucked
Grimy niggasll stick Santa up
Kill Rudolph then eat em you couldnt manage us
Why you think niggas is comatose
Homie gave the other homie mama bag now he got mad
Gotta kill em with the mag cause she overdosed
If I gotta box its the 52 or the ropeadope
Stuntin in the drop
Plottin on the lot I could build on
Cross me Ima rock a nigga knot
I aint thinkin like your average nigga
I got carats off of carrots sellin juice
Peaceful yet a savage nigga
You could lie about them Cartel ties
Well Im the type of guy to leave the Cartel tied
Get the match and the gas watch the Cartel die
Ill catch em slippin in the gym and let a barbell fly
Break his face with a plate like the ghost did Charlie Murphy
But Im the real ghost you aint no Charlie Murphy
Not in the comedic way
Im the one who make Paul and Peter pay
9 millimeter spray
What you know about the trap bein slow cause the grams bad
But the plug want his dough so you pay for your man half  Ill take care of that 
44 Bulldog makin your pants sag
I swim the swamp with a gator I made it a handbag
They tell me Im how hope look
Them pots had to slow cook
Stack of paper on my kitchen table look like notebooks
Two shooters with you We know them niggas they both puss
Roll through and I let this toast cook like Rosewood
Black Soprano family I probably should make the movie
Pray over a brick while Im slidin a razor through em
Back to back trips now I got my bitch draped in Lou
Im known for rock and a guitar like David Bowie
Yeah I went against the FBI and crooked judges
When rappers start losin limbs you know the Butcher comin
Yall still gassed off my rookie numbers
This the kid thats from a block that did Westside Gunn hoodie numbers
Uh I grew to be a hustler but I ran with thieves  But I ran with thieves 
You steal from the gang I bet your handsll bleed
I met in a plug in the feds who used to hand me kis
We was like Donovan McNabb and Andy Reid
Take me to your trap I really autograph the plate
I fuck around and put my signature on a bag of H
Yall niggas usin 12 12s and call it stackin cake
When my niggas bag up we usin garbage bags and tape
Lets go agh
