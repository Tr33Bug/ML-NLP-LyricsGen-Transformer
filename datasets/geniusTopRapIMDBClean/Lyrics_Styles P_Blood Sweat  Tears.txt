No longer wild I watch the money pile
Funny ass niggas will act funny style
Funny how they want you slowed down when you running round
Be able to lift you up but they will gun you down
Plan is expand and travel throughout the land
Some scam some blam some niggas go hand in hand
Since the Dana Dane days is the times I was slinging haze
Got the picture but never the frame in the same day
Aint a Blood but my man is I bleed for him
Aint a Crip but my man is I C for him
Couple homies locked up Im staying free for em
The youth need a old head I keep it G for em
Im usually riding in the back seat
But if I drive ima play the lane to the max speed
Extraordinary gentleman last league
Pardon self I mean last breed
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood sweat  tears for a lot of years
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood sweat  tears for a lot of years
I could shed a tear I could shred a beer  I could 
I could dance on a track like Im Fred Astaire  ha 
Reflect on the past and look forward to better years  forward 
Settle my affairs with whoever I bought the metal here
On a mission looking for God you brought the devil here
I dont like your energy homie it shouldnt settle here
Hot and I boil like the water in the kettle yeah
And I set the standard for bars that you could never near  never 
Full of grief put you to sleep Id rather chief
Know my style and you give me some weed give me a leaf
I would two piece and stab up the devil cause he a thief  facts 
Stealing the joy stealing the peace
But thats another time and another rhyme  another time 
Feds got your phone tapped I wouldnt say another crime  shh 
And thats my word nigga  my word 
I keep it G but Im honoring my nerd nigga Ghost dog


For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood sweat  tears for a lot of years
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood sweat  tears for a lot of years
Ever lost part of your mind That shit is painful  I have 
Used to sell dope to my folks that shit is shameful
World is full of sinners so nobody could blame you
I am out enjoying the sun thats what the rain do
I am out enjoying the rain thats what the change do
I am ordained in the pains and the flames too  Im ordained 
Dont you know that dog  huh 
Its a Kodak moment when the feds come
And niggas take the low jack off  woo 
Love to see the bad guy get away  love it 
Im a stoner so I never let the high get away
And my ghost got a ghost its a rival today  ghost 
And I found a new way Ive decided to pave
Out nigga
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood sweat  tears for a lot of years
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood sweat  tears for a lot of years
