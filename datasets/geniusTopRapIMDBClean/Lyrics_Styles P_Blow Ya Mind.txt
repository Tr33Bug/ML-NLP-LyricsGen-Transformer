Ghost  Its showtime its showtime 
Ghost cmon  Lighters in the air 
I wanna roll somethin up so II can just
Blow my mind  Lighters in the air 
I wanna blow my mind  Hey hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow my mind  Hey lighters in the air 
You should roll somethin up so you can just um
Blow your mind  Blow your mind 
You should just blow your mind  Hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow your mind  Hey hey lighters in the air 
Mind blown and Im tore down
Still blow an ounce and a half even more now
Yeah put your lighters in the air light it up in here
Yeah put it in the air see if Ima fuckin care
You should find out I came to blow my mind out
Pass it and you drop it Ima put you on time out
Like Joe Frazier Im smokin midring got me open
In the tub but it feel like the ocean
I swear to God I be floatin
And I dont need a car to be coastin you could say that Im boastin
But this is SP and I know my time
When I hear showtime Ima blow my mind
I wanna roll somethin up so II can just
Blow my mind  Lighters in the air 
I wanna blow my mind  Hey hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow my mind  Hey lighters in the air 
You should roll somethin up so you can just um
Blow your mind  Blow your mind 
You should just blow your mind  Hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow your mind  Hey hey lighters in the air 
The black hippie the sack with me the lighter too
I have dreams of Amsterdam every night or two  Amsterdam 
I feel good the sky couldnt be a brighter blue
Sun lookin like a tangerine
You got green and its mean brother hit me like a tambourine
I need a minute to myself second to myself
Pass the Dutchie on the left whoevers suckin on the L
Ima need candy cause I know my breath is gon smell
I dont get sleep but some good restin off a L
Mind blown time fly times gone
Missed my exit on the highway I ride on
Roll another one get in my good time zone
I wanna roll somethin up so II can just
Blow my mind  Lighters in the air 
I wanna blow my mind  Hey hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow my mind  Hey lighters in the air 
You should roll somethin up so you can just um
Blow your mind  Blow your mind 
You should just blow your mind  Hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow your mind  Hey hey lighters in the air 
Im gone the gnac and the wine gone
Eyes look sewn shut but what Im grown
Over twentyone come over to my zone
In less than two hours see a fifty box blown
Lovin the smell feelin the texture
And we got a whole lot but we still gettin extra
Guess whats on the menu for breakfast
Roll with the Ghost if you wanna get messed up
I wanna roll somethin up so II can just
Blow my mind  Lighters in the air 
I wanna blow my mind  Hey hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow my mind  Hey lighters in the air 
You should roll somethin up so you can just um
Blow your mind  Blow your mind 
You should just blow your mind  Hey hey hey lighters in the air 
Blow your mind  Hey hey lighters in the air 
I mean just get blown away
You know do what you do
Bungee jump or somethin speed in the car
Do whatever blows your mind away
I know what blows mine away
You should roll somethin up so you can just um
Blow your mind
