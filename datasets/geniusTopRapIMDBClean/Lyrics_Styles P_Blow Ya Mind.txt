Blow Ya Mind Lyrics
Ghost (It's showtime, it's showtime)
Ghost, c'mon (Lighters in the air)

I wanna roll somethin' up so I-I can just
Blow my mind (Lighters in the air)
I wanna blow my mind (Hey, hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow my mind (Hey, lighters in the air)
You should roll somethin' up so you can just, um
Blow your mind (Blow your mind)
You should just blow your mind (Hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow your mind (Hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Mind blown and I'm tore down
Still blow an ounce and a half, even more now
Yeah, put your lighters in the air, light it up in here
Yeah, put it in the air, see if I'ma fuckin' care
You should find out I came to blow my mind out
Pass it and you drop it, I'ma put you on time out
Like Joe Frazier I'm smokin' mid-ring, got me open
In the tub, but it feel like the ocean
I swear to God I be floatin'
And I don't need a car to be coastin', you could say that I'm boastin'
But this is S.P., and I know my time
When I hear "showtime", I'ma blow my mind

I wanna roll somethin' up so I-I can just
Blow my mind (Lighters in the air)
I wanna blow my mind (Hey, hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow my mind (Hey, lighters in the air)
You should roll somethin' up so you can just, um
Blow your mind (Blow your mind)
You should just blow your mind (Hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow your mind (Hey, hey, lighters in the air)

The black hippie, the sack with me, the lighter, too
I have dreams of Amsterdam every night or two (Amsterdam)
I feel good, the sky couldn't be a brighter blue
Sun lookin' like a tangerine
You got green and it's mean, brother, hit me like a tambourine
I need a minute to myself, second to myself
Pass the Dutchie on the left, whoever's suckin' on the L
I'ma need candy 'cause I know my breath is gon' smell
I don't get sleep, but some good restin' off a L
Mind blown, time fly, time's gone
Missed my exit on the highway, I ride on
Roll another one, get in my good time zone
You might also like
I wanna roll somethin' up so I-I can just
Blow my mind (Lighters in the air)
I wanna blow my mind (Hey, hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow my mind (Hey, lighters in the air)
You should roll somethin' up so you can just, um
Blow your mind (Blow your mind)
You should just blow your mind (Hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow your mind (Hey, hey, lighters in the air)

I'm gone, the 'gnac and the wine gone
Eyes look sewn shut, but what? I'm grown
Over twenty-one, come over to my zone
In less than two hours, see a fifty box blown
Lovin' the smell, feelin' the texture
And we got a whole lot, but we still gettin' extra
Guess what's on the menu for breakfast
Roll with the Ghost if you wanna get messed up

I wanna roll somethin' up so I-I can just
Blow my mind (Lighters in the air)
I wanna blow my mind (Hey, hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow my mind (Hey, lighters in the air)
You should roll somethin' up so you can just, um
Blow your mind (Blow your mind)
You should just blow your mind (Hey, hey, hey, lighters in the air)
Blow your mind (Hey, hey, lighters in the air)
I mean just get blown away
You know, do what you do
Bungee jump or somethin', speed in the car
Do whatever blows your mind away
I know what blows mine away
You should roll somethin' up so you can just, um
Blow your mindEmbed
