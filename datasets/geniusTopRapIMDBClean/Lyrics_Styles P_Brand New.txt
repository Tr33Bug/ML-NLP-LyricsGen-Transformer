I just wanna feel the vibes you know
I just like um smokin and rhymin and collectin
Pretty much
Shit like that
Flowin stay on the paper chase
Tryna hit the jeweler for somethin that I could take away
We could be in the race bet you Ima break away
You aint got a place if anybody could take your place
The jewel kicker the cool nigga  Ayy 
Im too smart to try to fool with you
You know hard knocks Ive been to school with you
You run in the jungle and keep a tool with you
Just relax you know

You could steal my lighter from me I dont mind nigga
But understand the buck stops there
I been searchin for the change like its bus stop fair
But you wouldnt get my method

Never seen a found nigga make nobody great
Get caught up in the jungle get your whole body ache
