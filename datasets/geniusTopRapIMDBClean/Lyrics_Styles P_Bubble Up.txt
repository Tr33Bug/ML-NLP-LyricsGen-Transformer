Whoa
Ghost
Thats right that shit movin
DBlock
That shit movin
Yes it is
Yeah
Long time comin out the gate  Had the golden key 
Whole squad waited for a plate  Now its time to eat 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga  Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em  Go to war with em 
Stay on your shit you gon bubble up  Bubble up 
When you on lit you gon double up  Double up 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga  Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em  Go to war with em 
Stay on your shit and you gon bubble up
We was all poor but we squad so we huddled up
If it aint a bullet or the law it dont trouble us
High doin dirt but Im hopin the Lord cover us
Uptown doin it downtown doin it out of state pursuin it
A cop or a shot from a Glock might ruin it
All I think about is who I drink this King Louis with
My niggas my main squeeze from the jungle
But it seems that money contain Gs
Told the plug make the call whenever the plane leaves
Feel joy from the money whenever the pain leaves
But the pain never goes
Moneys the root of evil am I sane for the flow Insane for the flow
But this the fast life and the lane never slows
Mary Jane for the dome
Ghost
Long time comin out the gate  Had the golden key 
Whole squad waited for a plate  Now its time to eat 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga  Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em  Go to war with em 
Stay on your shit you gon bubble up  Bubble up 
When you on lit you gon double up  Double up 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga  Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em  Go to war with em 
When you on lit you gon double up
Louis everything two of everything cuddled up
Got the work blew up everything now they fuck wit us
Long climb but it seem fast like we shuttled up
Tuna in a can to that lobster buttered up
Now I eat plants and I plan to plant some
Plannin to stamp somethin and niggas cant fuck it up
Cause we aint golden until we all shine
Can my Ghost live longer than one lifetime
Four left turns Im in my right mind
Flyin to Tiffanys from kickin epiphanies
While I was hittin trees and thinkin of victories
Turned a nick to a dime and bought me a nick of weed
Made me a little rhyme planted a little seed
Tomorrows ghost night today is ghost eve
So I told my ghost Go flow proceed
Long time comin out the gate  Had the golden key 
Whole squad waited for a plate  Now its time to eat 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga  Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em  Go to war with em 
Stay on your shit you gon bubble up  Bubble up 
When you on lit you gon double up  Double up 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga  Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em  Go to war with em 
Heard them niggas prayin that we fall nigga
Extra clips when we go to war with em
Rather peace I dont wanna go to war with em
If I had to swear to God Id give it all to em
Know the feelin my nigga Ive been poor with em
But they cant walk on me Im not a floor for em
Only God knows what He has in store for em
Lord doeth as He shall and thats all for em
Ghost nigga
