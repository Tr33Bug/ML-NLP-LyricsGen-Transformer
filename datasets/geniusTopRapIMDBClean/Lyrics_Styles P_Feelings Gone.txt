Cause the feeling is gone 
And I must get it back
Trust me nothing prepares us
They never say gettin money slows your prayers up
We already in Hell Nothin can scare us
We already fly high nothin can air us
Came from the underground so I stay grounded astounded
By all the bullshit that I founded
A wise man can lose you soon as he gain jewels
Life get real and you think the pains cool
You different you makin a change you let your man tell it
Blowin chronic am I demonic or angelic
No vanilla Dutch fuck it get a panetela
Roll a one sheet think about my rap sheet
Sellin crack will have you runnin like a track meet
Watchin your back on every other back street
I started so young why you think Im so numb
You cant feel shit and only like real shit
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you dont know what block Im front of
DBlock layin em down
And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock
You know my name you heard my raps
You know my name aint nuttin changed
SP and I done been through it all
From here on I spit it in rare form
The moon stay quiet but the sun spoke
Still cant blow away the pain with the blunt smoke
Tryin to give my daughter and my son hope
The shit get rough when you breathin in the gun smoke
Do it all for a pile of the cash funny
But I really only smile when I laugh  thats all 
You can say the pain run deep and I wonder
Do the insane or the sane ones speak
And I feel like the devil got chains on me
Im inside but I still feel the rain on me
Its raining  like its comin through the window or the windshield
Life full of sinsll have you spinnin like a windmill
Contract with God is signed and it been sealed
See you at the crossroads if everything has been real
I can feel what you cant
And the shit is vice versa so feel what you cant


You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you dont know what block Im front of
DBlock layin em down
And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock
You know my name you heard my raps
You know my name aint nuttin changed
SP and I done been through it all
From here on I spit it in rare form
I told you it is what it is
Cant choose how to die but I can choose how to live  true 
Thought about it just sittin where I live
Just another ghetto nigga with a million dollar crib
No hope then I dropped the E and got hoppin
Got hip just so I could get a little guap  you get it 
Before that I used to move rock
With a 4 to 10 job after school workin stock  word 
Then I said Fuck pickin up a box
So I sold more drugs started stickin mo spots
Thats why I thank God for this rap shit
Niggas be frontin cause we used to livin backwards
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you dont know what block Im front of
DBlock layin em down
And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock
You know my name you heard my raps
You know my name aint nuttin changed
SP and I done been through it all
From here on I spit it in rare form
