Shhh  Two guns up mothafucka Two guns up mothafucka  overlap  
Real shitStyles P Shit
If P want you dead I aint comin wit niggas
Just a blunt and a tre pound plenty of liquor
So ya homies got something to pour
Thats that old school shit
I aint tryin to put you under the floor
Im tryin ta bang niggas over the clouds
And I heard you say you rich
So you cant get lower than Styles
Kill everybody dead just so noone can smile
Play the streets my whole life and I been flowin a while
Biget I rock ever since my nigga was shot and my other nigga
Will shoot shit Im tellin the truth
If I lie may I die in the middle of the verse
My niggas hustle from first to first
Twelve months in a year
Gun on your waist Blunt in your ear
Pack in your sock crate at the back of the block
With a fiend watchin for NARCS till the shit get dark
We hop in the hoop ride instead of the six
While you lookin for a bitch we lookin for a brick
That we can cook by six and give the whole block a fix
Catch me OT gettin sixty a shift
Holidy Styles nigga I aint nothin but streets
Just as hard as the shit that be under your feet
And the only time I front is with a blunt in the beak
To show niggas that Im nice and they aint fuckin wit me
Felony Niggas
Cop coke Heavily Niggas
Thatll arm rob seventy niggas
You know
Murderin niggas
You want dope they servin you niggas
Stay in 5th gear swervin on niggas
You know
Whether we ryde or we die we gon get this dough
All I know is drugs and guns
And plenty of weed
And that bitch that suck dick
And niggas that bleed
And if youre rich before you go
Get a watch and a drop
You better hit the court house
And better bail out the block
If your son aint worth shit
Niggasll smuggle your daughter
I come through in a Porshe
The same color as water
I got weight what you want
I can cover the order
They call me Boss when I cross the border
Six shot caught her
I hear niggas say my face is screwed
But Ill put six in your stomach nigga
Lace your food
Scream Fuck Every Rapper that hate that Im rude
But thats that SP shit you can take it or move
We can let the bullets spill till we all get killed
Theres only six nice rappers
If you wanna be real
Niggas die everyday from talking that dumb shit
That where theyre from shit
All that mean to me is you can get your gun quick
Just another dumb bitch
Go to church to get the holy ghost
I did my dirt and got the holy ghost
Look at the world through a niggas eyes
Dont be a bitch you gonna live and die
Ribbon in the sky but no love when you slither by
I pray to god that we make it to heaven
But the only thing we makin is channel eleven
You know four five and seven hot as fuck
And every rapper be dead if they were hotter than us
But since niggas still alive they should be tellin you somethin
You aint hear from Holiday he aint tellin you nothin
You knowcocksucker
