Fire  Pain  Pain Killas  Lyrics
WOOO Ha King Selassie I know
Sizzla Kalonji girls smiles whoayeahyeahhh
Shit is too too crazy listen
Got bad luck like I ran and fucked the voodoo lady
Every other week Im in handcuffs
Stack somethin lose somethin somethin keep fuckin my plans up
Movin in a hurry thinkin time is slow
When I pass the cemetery where my lil brother is buried
All I can do is salute pound on my chest
God got his army and we all his recruits
But every other night I see demons
Do somethin wild and I dont know the reasons
Blame it on the air so I say its the seasons
Tell my niggas light the fuck up cause Im fiendin
Get it  its somethin when the sadness turn into madness
Got me doin shit where Im runnin from badges
I can see my life in some flashes they think that Im clashes
I pour more gnac in the glass kid
Its all about we got da tools wid us
Fuckin CRAZY Things aint gonna be cool wid us
Luxurious  bring the guns along dey always cruise wid us
Those fuckers know better thats cause dem no fool wid us
Huh fuckin dogs we gon put dem in some leeches
As far as it reaches we gon iron out dem creases
With the four pieces DEM got to use around the neck
Cannon go squeezes DEM a soldier CRAZY believe it
I go to sleep and my soul cry nigga its no lie
Why you think Im so high I flow like its no time
Funny when your mind is a goldmine and niggas is golddiggers
Guess you gon learn when its yo time
Stressed up to my shoulders fuck it Imma ride now
Brim of the Yankee sittin on my eyebrows
Look at the stash and think that Im gassed
Off the Godfather saga cause Vito wouldnt lie down
Me and destiny got a date wheover with me rollin
If you aint then you go get your 8 cause I aint gon fold
I take em all on
Ive been dyin for the day to get my war on
I reflect on the days when I played Rahway gettin my score on
And came back to the hood with my forearms
Go get more mans I got floor plans
And 23 ways to blow you out of them Jordans


Try to beat me but dont worry I got dem
Make dem bleed blood its a pleasure to squash dem
They aint allathat so I saw dem
Escapin from de cops dem aint see me tryin to stop dem
Say youre livin BIG On top of de world
You go against me you gon get freed on dis side of de world yah
They say youre mad I say things comes and go
But I never leave mi gun because I wan kill dem fuckin punks
Some niggas say Im the sickest
If I got a show ghetto niggas go get the ticket
If I aint blow on the stage I had me a gauge
Outside on some bullshit ready to stick it
Like the hood made me wicked as hell
Thought about more bullshit sittin in jail listen up
Its nothin more important than feedin your seeds
I got two so I just start believin in greed
Its like Im needin the weed and needin to read
Got to go against the odds just to even achieve
Its like Im tired of the hassle and all that
You the king I run up in your castle and all that
Im nicer than whoever you can name been through the dark side
Walked back through the flames and came with a lightning push
Shined on the game and erybody die
At the drop of a dime if they rhyme on my name
Sit bak relax heah we kickin for a while
Sizzla Kalonji and Styles yeah beautiful girls dey smile
Bless your feet on de Jamaican side dats de profile
Why de fuck de fuckin enemies wanna spoil yeah
True born leaders woo yeah we navigate
Yah life is a cycle so things got to gravitate
Smoke de fuckin herb thats how I meditate
One love to de world damn tell dem we aint gon seperate
Shit is crazy life is somethin really
Im the Ghost woo
We gotta live though fuck it yknow
I know feel me nigga
