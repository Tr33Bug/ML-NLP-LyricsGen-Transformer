Freestyle 4  The Ghost In The Machine  Lyrics
When the games seldom my mans in a cell and its too close to hell and the pains overwhelming
Only thing he left was his name for his children
Shit hurt me bad said the shame almost killed him
Dog you aint to blame know the game did us reeled in
Used to have dames that got brains at the Hilton
Even had the Range and the chain that he chilled in
Now he just survive off the beast that was builtin
I stay strong for him later on the side for him
Cause he a hard nigga but shit hard for him
I pray to God for him and me too
A lot of niggas see through
I aint tryna hear shit but I need to
Im thugged out but I muthafuckin read too
Im conscious but I like to blow weed too
So Im complex
Im on the armrest life aint right yet
I stay strong from my fitted to my Nike checks nigga
Keep the mask like Halloween on dog
Olive green Maserati fourdoor
My ghost asked what Im poor for
Hit the safe and take more raw
That was my into
Give it up again heard it was simple
But years later took a toll on my mental
Shiiit
Now I move with animal instincts
Where Im from you could tell if the shit stink
Nigga hustle hard wear your clothes a week in a row and fuck what a bitch think
Catch me in something fast with something stashed
Puffin on something fat I know dont nothing last
Ride now blow later on em
Lettin out with Luis shoes little bit of gator on em
Pop a bottle if you made it on em
Tell them niggas you cant lose and dont move cause the eight is on em
And tell my niggas in jail Ill be waiting on em
Blow till Im too high
Roll when the crew ride
Benz and the Bimmer nigga still in the hoop ride
Raised in a place you was taught how to shoot five
Buck ninety something nigga I could make the coupe fly
Hood till the day I die
Good with the way I ride
Two guns one knifeshit Im tryna stay alive
Twenty on the yack bottle blowin on a fifty piece
Rap dont work muthafucker Ima hit the streets
Bar codes on the Dutch now I gotta hit the leak
Been up two years straight dog I dont get to sleep
I aint complain when it was caine money
Why complain when its the game money
If its out one hand in the next hand you ask me its the same money
Learn the game if you playin it
Game if you Jin it
Listen to what I say cause Im sayin it
Most niggas dont aim they be sprayin it
