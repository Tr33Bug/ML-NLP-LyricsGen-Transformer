Freestyle 4 (The Ghost In The Machine) Lyrics
When the game's seldom, my man's in a cell and it's too close to hell and the pain's overwhelming
Only thing he left was his name for his children
Shit hurt me bad, said the shame almost killed him
Dog you ain't to blame, know the game did us reeled in
Used to have dames that got brains at the Hilton
Even had the Range and the chain that he chilled in
Now he just survive off the beast that was built-in
I stay strong for him, later on the side for him
Cause he a hard nigga, but shit hard for him
I pray to God for him, and me too
A lot of niggas see through
I ain't tryn'a hear shit but I need to
I'm thugged out but I mutha'fuckin read too
I'm conscious but I like to blow weed too
So I'm complex
I'm on the armrest life ain't right yet
I stay strong from my fitted to my Nike checks, nigga

Keep the mask, like Halloween, on dog
Olive green Maserati four-door
My ghost asked what I'm poor for?
Hit the safe and take more raw
That was my into
Give it up again, heard it was simple
But years later took a toll on my mental
Shiiit
Now I move with animal instincts
Where I'm from you could tell if the shit stink
Nigga hustle hard, wear your clothes a week in a row and fuck what a bitch think
Catch me in something fast, with something stashed
Puffin on something fat I know don't nothing last
Ride now blow later on 'em
Lettin out with Luis shoes, little bit of gator on 'em
Pop a bottle if you made it on 'em
Tell them niggas you can't lose and don't move cause the eight is on 'em
And tell my niggas in jail I'll be waiting on 'em

Blow till I'm too high
Roll when the crew ride
Benz and the Bimmer nigga, still in the hoop ride
Raised in a place you was taught how to shoot five
Buck ninety something nigga, I could make the coupe fly
Hood till the day I die
Good with the way I ride
Two guns one knife,shit I'm tryn'a stay alive
Twenty on the yack bottle, blowin' on a fifty piece
Rap don't work, mutha'fucker I'ma hit the streets
Bar codes on the Dutch, now I gotta hit the leak
Been up two years straight, dog I don't get to sleep
I ain't complain when it was caine money
Why complain when it's the game money?
If it's out one hand, in the next hand, you ask me, it's the same money
Learn the game if you playin it
Game if you J'in it
Listen to what I say cause I'm sayin it
Most niggas don't aim, they be sprayin itYou might also like1Embed
