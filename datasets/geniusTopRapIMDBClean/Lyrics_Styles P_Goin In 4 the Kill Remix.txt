Goin In 4 the Kill  Remix  Lyrics
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
This is for hoods everywhere
Im back
We aint come here for the chitchat
But shit got a hell of a kickback
And I dont give a fuck so your face like a Dutch
Imma go head and split that
Niggas in the top five fuck is the list at
Everybody die where they poppin they Cris at
Gun in your mouth brain on your wall you try to get louder than I
Go smoke Im responsible for clouds in the sky
And you couldnt find a nigga thats wilder than I
The roof the same color as shit nigga
Run up and hit niggas God bless whoever you with nigga
Somebody gonna break down and cry when they look at your face
How the four bullets break down your eye
Im from a place where you kicked out or die
Shit real when they catch you at the wheel
And blow your face out the ride
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
If you forgot my name or my style
Im the ghost with the hornet flow with a corner style
In a piece of shit car
With two 45s bout to rob everything I been gone a while
They aint let you know Im a grimeball
Whenever the time calls I find yall Im taking your spine off
Lets be serious dead serious
If you with cops how you lettin your nine off
Yo you got a hole in you and you bleeding
So its not like Im just callin you pussy for no reason
Me Im a bastard
I hit the blunts til I gotta cough then I pass em
Exhaust on the Aston
That next choice you make might be your last one
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now whos the king of New York now
Boys got safes in the house I got a vault now
Chorus La Roux Jadakiss 
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Just mad you will never be as nice as I am 
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
Just mad you will never be as nice as I am 
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Ugh put my life on it
Soon as you sit in hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
Ive been giving it to niggas for years
Fans still gettin wireless head thats with no hands
Listen my  composition compared to yalls is way beyond existence
DBlock daddy new black Caddy
Comin through knocking Michael McDonald and Pattie
Ps and haze is still going for eight and a natty
Rather have God arrest me then Satan and bag me
Get serious Ill gladly involve ya moms
AlQaeda Jada Im only involved with bombs
Ugh put my life on it
Soon as you sit in hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
Ive been giving it to niggas for years
Im responsible for niggas careers
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Yall niggas need a cosign homie Im the gold mine
Montana Johnson when its showtime
Nigga pass the ball make a call watch me go in for the kill
I was stuntin on you corny niggas way before the deal
Fast money fuckin hoes flippin work call me flip
Rap niggas all diesel homie probably a script
See the black van packed up skimasks black gloves
Four niggas mashed up get a nigga wrapped up
I did it like a boss fuck a handout
Room full of centers Im a standout
Now I gave em no choice got the cokeboy shit planned out
Hundredfifty Spider all tanned out Montana  Montana 
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Listen
For all my dopeboys up over them pots mixin
New  on the block chasin hot vixens
Gettin money right Well do your thing shorty
The drama messy I send some niggas to clean for me
They leave the scene spotless I like my Vs topless
The hoes talk about me see Im the trendin topic
See the riots that gang and yall know that
That break it up and give it to the strip you know Im on that
Im stickin to the format
Never catch him slippin like Im stickin to the floormat
So these niggas could fall back
I toss some money in the sky and watch it trickle down
Came a long way from the Ps take a look at me now
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Keys to the Beamer Beamie take the top off
Did yall watch the fumes come out like a genie
Thats the Sour power cant  me bitch
Love when Im high cause my eyes look dreamy
Fourfifth chrome thatll leave your dome steamy
Custommade Lenscrafters still couldnt see me
Flip pimp and crack dough
I roll the O you pop the Ex ticktacktoe
Send my condolence give him hope for best wishes
They hate cause they bitches ride my stick like witches
Nowadays niggas fraudulent frontin all gimmicks
In the game they all the same might as well get a mimic
Order to your dog UPS with deliverance
My man in the can gettin green like spinach
like Popeye the 
Yeah Cheeze ya dealin man
They spinnin on the top like 
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
