Goinâ€™ In 4 the Kill (Remix) Lyrics
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

This is for hoods everywhere
I'm back..
We ain't come here for the chit-chat
But shit got a hell of a kickback
And I don't give a fuck, so your face like a Dutch
I'mma go head and split that
Niggas in the top five; fuck is the list at?
Everybody die where they poppin' they Cris at
Gun in your mouth, brain on your wall, you try to get louder than I
Go smoke, I'm responsible for clouds in the sky
And you couldn't find a nigga that's wilder than I
The roof the same color as shit, nigga
Run up and hit niggas; God bless whoever you with, nigga
Somebody gonna break down and cry, when they look at your face
How the four bullets break down your eye
I'm from a place where you kicked out or die
Shit real, when they catch you at the wheel
And blow your face out the ride
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill..

If you forgot my name, or my style
I'm the ghost with the hornet flow, with a corner style
In a piece of shit car
With two 45's, 'bout to rob everything, I been gone a while
They ain't let you know I'm a grime-ball
Whenever the time calls, I find ya'll, I'm taking your spine off
Let's be serious, dead serious
If you with cops, how you lettin' your nine off?

Yo, you got a hole in you, and you bleeding
So it's not like I'm just callin' you pussy for no reason
Me, I'm a bastard
I hit the blunts til' I gotta cough, then I pass 'em
Exhaust on the Aston
That next choice you make, might be your last one
Shit that I needed, stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now, who's the king of New York now?
Boys got safes in the house, I got a vault now

I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
(Just mad you will never be as nice as I am)
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
(Just mad you will never be as nice as I am)
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin in for the kill..

Ugh, put my life on it
Soon as you sit in hot water, all you gotta do is put the ice on it
I've been giving it to niggas for years
Fans still gettin' wireless head, that's with no hands
Listen, my  composition, compared to y'alls is way beyond existence
D-Block daddy, new black Caddy
Comin' through knocking Michael McDonald and Pattie
P's and haze is still going for eight and a natty
Rather have God arrest me, then Satan and bag me
Get serious, I'll gladly involve ya moms
Al-Qaeda Jada, I'm only involved with bombs
Ugh, put my life on it
Soon as you sit in hot water, all you gotta do is put the ice on it
I've been giving it to niggas for years
I'm responsible for niggas careers
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand..

Ya'll niggas need a co-sign; homie, I'm the gold mine
Montana Johnson when it's showtime
Nigga pass the ball, make a call; watch me go in for the kill
I was stuntin' on you corny niggas way before the deal
Fast money, fuckin' hoes, flippin' work; call me flip
Rap niggas all diesel, homie; probably a script
See the black van packed up; ski-masks, black gloves
Four niggas mashed up, get a nigga wrapped up
I did it like a boss, fuck a hand-out
Room full of centers, I'm a stand-out
Now I gave 'em no choice; got the coke-boy shit planned out
Hundred-fifty Spider all tanned out; Montana (Montana)..

I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand..

Listen
For all my dope-boys up over them pots mixin'
New  on the block chasin' hot vixens
Gettin' money, right? Well do your thing, shorty
The drama messy, I send some niggas to clean for me
They leave the scene spotless; I like my V's topless
The hoes talk about me, see I'm the trendin' topic
See the riot's that gang, and ya'll know that
That break it up and give it to the strip, you know I'm on that
I'm stickin' to the format
Never catch him slippin', like I'm stickin' to the floor-mat
So these niggas could fall back
I toss some money in the sky and watch it trickle down
Came a long way from the P's; take a look at me now

I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand..

Keys to the Beamer; Beamie take the top off
Did ya'll watch the fumes come out like a genie?
That's the Sour; power can't  me, bitch
Love when I'm high, cause my eyes look dreamy
Four-fifth chrome, that'll leave your dome steamy
Custom-made Lenscrafters still couldn't see me
Flip, pimp, and crack dough
I roll the O, you pop the Ex; tick-tack-toe
Send my condolence, give him hope for best wishes
They hate cause they bitches; ride my stick like witches
Nowadays niggas fraudulent, frontin'; all gimmicks
In the game they all the same; might as well get a mimic
Order to your dog, UPS with deliverance
My man in the can gettin' green like spinach
 like Popeye the 
Yeah, Cheeze ya dealin' man
They spinnin' on the top, like 

I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand..3Embed
