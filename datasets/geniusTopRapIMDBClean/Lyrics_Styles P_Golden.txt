Golden Lyrics
Be who you are
Say what you mean
Feel how you feel
You got to believe that you're golden (talk that talk Xander)
Golden
You're chosen
Chosen

I know that I'm golden, I know that I'm chosen (I am)
The world's on my shoulders but I ain't foldin' (uh uh)
I'm gettin' real high, yeah I'm still rollin'
I know that I'm blessed but I know them omens (I know)
Curse the stress yet I work the best (yeah)
If I can't fly high that'll hurt the nest (ha)
I'm just tryna make money so the earth could rest
Yeah I'm tryna live neat, is it worth the mess? (is it worth it?)
My brain is tired, my soul's exhausted
My frame feel weak thinkin' what could I morph in (what could I morph in)
I know I'm a winner but I think of the losses (think of em)
They all been major now my heart is frosted
Maybe I lost it, maybe I found it (maybe)
Maybe I was flyin' when I thought I was grounded (mm)
Feelin' half dead but my heart is poundin' (my heart's poundin')
I think about the angels, I pray I'm surrounded
Ghost nigga
Be who you are
Say what you mean
Feel how you feel
You got to believe that you're golden (you gotta believe)
Golden
You're chosen (you know)
Chosen
Chest to the sky, take control of your time (take control)
Picture the future then make it your life
You're golden (golden you know)
Golden
Remember you're chosen
Chosen

I know that I'm golden, I gotta believe dogg (gotta believe)
If I don't do that then it's nothin' to breathe for
If I can't exist, then it's nothin' to be for
No third eye, then it's nothin to see for (nothin')
Now you wouldn't understand if I told you (you wouldn't understand)
I don't need love, I ain't lookin' to hold you (uh uh)
Just a strong crib for the shit that I go through
It's probably vice versa so why would I scold you? (why?)
Yeah I'm all by myself yellin', "Christ sake" (Christ sake)
They ain't got a pill can take for a life ache (uh uh)
I don't do religion tell me what is the right faith
What is the wrong faith? What is the strong faith? (tell me)
If I took a shortcut, what is the long way? (huh)
Violate the dusk, then what would the dawn say?
Knowin' I'm a king, tell me what would a pawn say? (tell me)
Knowin' I'm a rose, tell me what would a thorn say?
Ghost nigga

Be who you are
Say what you mean
Feel how you feel (feel how you feel)
You got to believe that you're golden (gotta believe)
Golden
You're chosen (you the chosen one)
Chosen
Chest to the sky, take control of your time (take control)
Picture the future then make it your life
You're golden (you golden)
Golden
Remember you're chosen (whenever)
