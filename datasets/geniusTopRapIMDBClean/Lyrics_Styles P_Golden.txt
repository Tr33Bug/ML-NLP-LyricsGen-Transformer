Golden
Youre chosen
Chosen
I know that Im golden I know that Im chosen  I am 
The worlds on my shoulders but I aint foldin  uh uh 
Im gettin real high yeah Im still rollin
I know that Im blessed but I know them omens  I know 
Curse the stress yet I work the best  yeah 
If I cant fly high thatll hurt the nest  ha 
Im just tryna make money so the earth could rest
Yeah Im tryna live neat is it worth the mess  is it worth it 
My brain is tired my souls exhausted
My frame feel weak thinkin what could I morph in  what could I morph in 
I know Im a winner but I think of the losses  think of em 
They all been major now my heart is frosted
Maybe I lost it maybe I found it  maybe 
Maybe I was flyin when I thought I was grounded  mm 
Feelin half dead but my heart is poundin  my hearts poundin 
I think about the angels I pray Im surrounded
Ghost nigga

You got to believe that youre golden  you gotta believe

Chosen
I know that Im golden I gotta believe dogg  gotta believe 
If I dont do that then its nothin to breathe for
If I cant exist then its nothin to be for
No third eye then its nothin to see for  nothin 
Now you wouldnt understand if I told you  you wouldnt understand 
I dont need love I aint lookin to hold you  uh uh 
Just a strong crib for the shit that I go through
Its probably vice versa so why would I scold you  why 
Yeah Im all by myself yellin Christ sake  Christ sake 
They aint got a pill can take for a life ache  uh uh 
I dont do religion tell me what is the right faith
What is the wrong faith What is the strong faith  tell me 
If I took a shortcut what is the long way  huh 
Violate the dusk then what would the dawn say
Knowin Im a king tell me what would a pawn say  tell me 
Knowin Im a rose tell me what would a thorn say
Ghost nigga

Feel how you feel  feel how you feel 
You got to believe that youre golden  gotta believe

Picture the future then make it your life
