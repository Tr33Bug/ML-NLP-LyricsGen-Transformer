The only flower that you know with a bounce and a half
Listen kid I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like bounce to the ave
I get high cause Im in the hood the guns is around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humbled me now  whew 
And Id rather roll somethin up cause if Im sober dog
I just might flip grab my guns and hold somethin up
I get high as a kite Im in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case Im dyin tonight  it happen tonight

Smoke like a chiminney inhaling matter fact I
Smoke like a gun when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did back in the 70s
Spit with the finishin touch  get this that
Ima finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blood on the walls you understand
Like the M5 pedal when its touchin the floor
I get high cause fuck it whats better to do
And Imma never give a fuck  thats right  cause Im better than you

Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do  I know dat 
High for a livin gots ta ride for a livin
With my real gangsta niggas thatll die for a livin  die my niggas 
Shit I get as high as I could cause if you see things
Like I see things that Imma die in the hood  right here 
Motherfucker understand its full service to you
I dont smoke the weed if it aint purple or blue
And you could name any rapper if you want he could die  anybody 
This is SP dump it in you bitch I get high
