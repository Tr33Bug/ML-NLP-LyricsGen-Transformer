Good Times Lyrics
"I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high on your memory, high on your memory
HIGH on your memory..."
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every night)
"I get high - high - high - high" (All the time)
"High-ighhhhhhh..."
Everyday I need an ounce and a half, S.P
The only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

"I get high - high - high - high" (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every night)
"I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory" (All the time)
"HIGH on your memory..." (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Every night)
"I get high - high - high - high" (All the time)
"High-ighhhhhhh..."

Aiyyo I
Smoke like a chim-in-ney {*inhaling*}, matter fact I
Smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

I'mma smoke till my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

"HIGH on your memory..." (Every day)
"I get high - high - high - high" (I am the Ghost)
"I get high - high - high - high" (Float with me)
"I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory
I get HIGH on your memory" (I get high like birds to planes)
"I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory"
I get HIGH on your memory" (I get high like, smokin' dubs to the head)
"I get high - high - high - high"
"High-ighhhhhhh..."6Embed
