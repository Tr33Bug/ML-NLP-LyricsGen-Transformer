Everyday I need an ounce and a half SP
The only flower that you know with a bounce and a half
Listen kid I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like bounce to the ave
I get high cause Im in the hood the guns is around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humbled me now  whew 
And Id rather roll somethin up cause if Im sober dog
I just might flip grab my guns and hold somethin up
I get high as a kite Im in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case Im dyin tonight  it happen tonight 
So I roll em up back to back fat as I could  uhhuh 
You got beef with Styles P I come to splatter the hood

Smoke like a chiminney inhaling matter fact I
Smoke like a gun when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did back in the 70s
Spit with the finishin touch  get this that
Ima finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blood on the walls you understand
Like the M5 pedal when its touchin the floor
I get high cause fuck it whats better to do
And Imma never give a fuck  thats right  cause Im better than you

Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do  I know dat 
High for a livin gots ta ride for a livin
With my real gangsta niggas thatll die for a livin  die my niggas 
Shit I get as high as I could cause if you see things
Like I see things that Imma die in the hood  right here 
Motherfucker understand its full service to you
I dont smoke the weed if it aint purple or blue
And you could name any rapper if you want he could die  anybody
