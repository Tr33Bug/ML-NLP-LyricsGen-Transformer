You know one day I got a call from the Ghost
Who told me I had to get on this conference call
To discuss a little business with him and the homey Rozay
Know a situation transpired
Where a nigga had to get dealt with a little harshly
Yeah
Root for the villain and shoot with no feelin
Like Audio Two yeah the crew is top billin
Blowin the Dutch in the coupe with no ceilin
Invisible bully like The Gooch when Im illin
Cash too green its taped to the toilet
Like Im Michael Corleone in the bathroom scene
Young black Vito chopped and wrapped kilos
Clap torpedoes stack Doritos
We in the Mexico sippin the mojito
Discussin perico green weed and diesel
AK muzzle airholes you can see through
Ridin the bulletproof five yeah Im lethal
Yo when niggas hear this shit they say its  Harsh 
Type of shit that make you wan handle a nigga  Harsh 
Act hostile aggressive and kinda  Harsh 
Im like a Rothschild with money thats why Im  Harsh 
How we dealin with em  Harsh  How we dealin with em  Harsh 
How we handlin em  Harsh  How we manglin em  Harsh 
Stop bitchin you the one who done caused me to act  Harsh 
Its that LOX shit right here
And if Im itchin and you front its my duty to act
Style is infectious actress in a Lexus
Sunroof open hashish for breakfast
Beef never settle Im Lyor to the ghetto  Huh 
Russell with the hustle Rick Rubin with the metal
When I lick a shot Im aimin at ya top floor  Woo 
Blocks like stocks everybody bought more  Hah 
Birds fell out the sky rats could drop dead
Flyin through BedStuy white drop head
Sticky green twist guillotine click  Huh 
Dapper Dan threepiece suit for the trip
Link with Dominicanos straight to Sofrito
Three point range hit free throws with kilos  Huh 
Yo when niggas hear this shit they say its  Harsh 
Type of shit that make you wan handle a nigga  Harsh 
Act hostile aggressive and kinda  Harsh 
Im like a Rothschild with money thats why Im  Harsh 
How we dealin with em  Harsh  How we dealin with em  Harsh 
How we handlin em  Harsh  How we manglin em  Harsh 
Stop bitchin you the one who done caused me to act  Harsh 
And if Im itchin and you front its my duty to act


Shine like brightening sure but Im the titan
Hard like when Cus DAmato was trainin Tyson
Gun weed and gnac in the car but no license
Life on top of the city could touch lightning
Cocaine wave dollar bill slave
Ranglers tough but the inside is suede
Ride with Louch and Kiss until I see a grave
One third of a legacy
Pedigree is I can make a don a don cause of integrity
Rap like a phenomenon sleep for a better dream
Nine is for deadin things smoke for medicine
BIG is the only rapper I dont think that Im better than
Yo when niggas hear this shit they say its  Harsh 
Type of shit that make you wan handle a nigga  Harsh 
Act hostile aggressive and kinda  Harsh 
Im like a Rothschild with money thats why Im  Harsh 
How we dealin with em  Harsh  How we dealin with em  Harsh 
How we handlin em  Harsh  How we manglin em  Harsh 
Stop bitchin you the one who done caused me to act  Harsh 
And if Im itchin and you front its my duty to act
Yo I rub stones together and cast a spell quick
Like a Zo hittin voodoo blessings fore I move bricks
I beat you like the number eleven with two sticks
Money from the door then when I bop with two chicks  Come on 
It wont stop never stop there he go again
Together watch the coke and how the baking soda blend
Fredricka kinda pure see how we make the fiends flock
And watch the line for the coca quickly wrap around the block
They say we bad for business cause the coke price dropped
How we flooded and we bubble white til its white hot  What 
Pot purchases we choppin up to pieces
Til only the shake is left countin the profit in Ibiza
Eight million dollar yacht scotch a little refer
Diamonds so big they call it an obnoxious little creature
Money to cop original paintings of Mona Lisa
High the way I feel a cloud sittin on my Caesar
Yo when niggas hear this shit they say its  Harsh 
Type of shit that make you wan handle a nigga  Harsh 
Act hostile aggressive and kinda  Harsh 
Im like a Rothschild with money thats why Im  Harsh 
How we dealin with em  Harsh  How we dealin with em  Harsh 
How we handlin em  Harsh  How we manglin em  Harsh 
Stop bitchin you the one who done caused me to act  Harsh 
And if Im itchin and you front its my duty to act
