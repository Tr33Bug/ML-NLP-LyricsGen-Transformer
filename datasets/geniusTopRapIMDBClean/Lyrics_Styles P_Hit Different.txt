Ayy
Space Ghost you know
Back at it as usual  Luxury Music 
I be getting high staying in high spirits
Ride of my life but Im watching the side mirrors
You gon smell smoke you pray to the sky near us
Ask God for forgiveness you ever to divide with us
So far Ive given you soul bars
Got a new frame but Im still seeing the old scars
New frame of thinkin my nigga know that Im so charged
Fivestar general all the stars is gold stars
And I got all of my stripes
You could ask your boss about me you could call him tonight
He dont know me then his man do thats what the plan do
And the whip moving fast but it got the handle yeah
Meaning I stay ready
And I came from the bottom my nigga Im way ptty
I got the treyeight you know that th J ready
Wanna meet with the reaper Im getting a day ready Ghost
Yeah hit different
When Im on the mic you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy know that I get with em
Dead presidents Im thinking to flips with em yeah
Hit different
When Im on the mic you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy know that I get with em
Dead presidents Im thinking to flips with em yeah
Inhale the love exhale the pain
No stress on the chest more stress on the brain
Stress on the soul but I know Im ordained
Found my om but believe me I could move through Orleans
A nigga staying alive
Staying out the way I upgraded the vibe
I subscribe to energy if its all good
If its bad then Im bouncin out or pullin out the 9
You say go figure I figure you aint going
If you aint got dough when I was drinking malt liquor  I got that 
Just imagine when my act clean
Alkaline body Im never taking a vaccine
I reclaim my time like Maxine
Cause I was in the waters with the crack fiends
I was in the mud with the dope fiends
Came from a gritty place why you think Im so clean


Yeah hit different
When Im on the mic you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy know that I get with em
Dead presidents Im thinking to flips with em yeah
Hit different
When Im on the mic you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy know that I get with em
Dead presidents Im thinking to flips with em yeah
Workin finna energize the money
To energize the wolf that ate the Energizer Bunny
You know how it feel if you been around the money
Or you could be sleep and you could be the sheep
To get skinned for his coat cause you thinking you the GOAT
You should smoke with me if you thinking you could float
Catch me overseas nigga waking from the boat
If I throw the Jet sign Im only saying to hang loose
Ima need a plug in Hawaii you know I slang fruit
Yeah I say peace a lot but know I bang too
I been on the streets a lot you know Im gang too
You could tell Im alpha my nigga you see the fangs too
Ima pull this thing out and bang it like it was Beirut
I am like the beat of the streets you know I stay looped
Im probably pushing a gray coupe
Whole crew rolling up Js but we aint JCrew
Yeah hit different
When Im on the mic you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy know that I get with em
Dead presidents Im thinking to flips with em yeah
Hit different
When Im on the mic you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy know that I get with em
Dead presidents Im thinking to flips with em yeah
