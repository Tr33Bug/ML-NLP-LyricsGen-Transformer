Kneedeep in the game
Due time youll see the sunshine if you sleep in the rain
I aint tryin to weather the storm
I get over the clouds and I aint talkin bout flyin a plane
Im in the slums where the guns is
Niggas sell crack to get hundreds  I mean thousands
I seen European cars by housing
I seen shinin on your block Im just browsin
Fofive make you get free
My London niggas say You get me I say I got you
Rude boy they better watch you
Too hot to handle too cold to hold
When I was young they used to say I had a older soul
Only death can make the soldiers fold
Comin down hit the floor let go all my soldiers roll
You get hit then your soul let go lets go
Lets go  We pop shots off at your bean
DBlock Byrd Gang thats the team  team team 
Big fifth make you move back
Go against them you dont really wanna do that
Them got that yay its a holiday  holiday baby 
If you fuck with my money then you might as well pay
Handgun and the rifle
And a knife too shit just that trifle
Get blood from your ice to your Nike boots
Head cracked like the dice do
I dont squeal nor squeak like the mice do
I get hype too come through the block and light you
Like a cigarette you aint seen a harder nigga yet
Hit you like a Nicorette
Off a lion nigga pick a pet I mean pick a beast
I run the city nigga pick a street
Matter fact you could pick a beef
Im old school we can shoot it out pick a heat
Fuck you
I get ya get the picture
Im the painter you the painted
Talkin shit when you aint shit
Im fivestar you aint ranked kid
Im major fuck the majors fuck the label
And take that to the bank kid
Its the Ghost or the Phantom
Killin rappers at random without a handgun cant stand him
Im too nice Im too hot
You dont wanna drop from the top of the rooftop
Turn the mic up turn the beat up
SP the Ghost still keep the fuckin booth hot
