Yeah
What up son
Havoc what up nigga good lookin for the beat
Ima talk shit over this one
Told you I got you my nigga
But um I want you to let these niggas know why you in that top 5
This is my livin nigga
Why you that nigga
It feel good in here
Yeah
Second time around Imma let the magic shoot
This time its off the Havoc flute yeah
Im a general and criminal yall fags salute
Im in the streets while yall sweet like a bag of fruit
And I stick to my timberlands like Im maganoo
Ya man lookin like he want it he can have it to
Try to tell these muthafuckas they should do as do does
I been smoking haze just as green as Gazoo was
Sorta like the city of Gods
We be screamin out we gon make it but I pity the odds
Im like knock out Ned when I pop out led
But I even been around to pass Biggie cigars
So I smoked wit a legend if you took the oath then the ghost is ya bredrin
Blowin smoke in the seven
Or maybe its the hooptie in these pisshole slums
Just tryna kick my piece off of kikos drums
Ya know
This is how we live
Smoking drinking hustling thinking
This is how we live
Drug spots projects Jail cell stinking
This is how we live
Whole block run when they see cop lights blinking
This is how we live
Benjamins grants Washingtons Lincolns
Die once you live twice die twice you live once
Get the shit confused so Im puffin on the big blunts
Kick it wit the kid that be deep in the zone
Its the ghost I got to go to sleep just to get home
Im spiritually outta this world
Meet my lyrics on the darkside come back when the dutchie get twirled
Im the alpha and omega of nice
Im the messenger sent by the force at the head of the light
But satans ridin my back in the dead of the night
I be doin some crazy shit for some bread and some ice
God Im tryna focus with my third eye lens
I smoke haze to see my brother when he blow that wind
And Im a grown man so I know my sins
And niggas dont get the picture so do Kodak win
The shitsover their head and under their nose
Not a star cause Im a sun when it come to a flow
Ya Know
This is how we live
Smoking drinking hustling thinking
This is how we live
Drug spots projects Jail cell stinking
This is how we live
Whole block run when they see cop lights blinking
This is how we live
Benjamins grants Washingtons Lincolns
Im a rare individual
Represent my team till they put in me in the earth no air in my physical
I dont need to dream I live another life when I sleep its so deep Imma
Spare you the visual
Far from religious but my heirs name is biblical
Stay away from crabs they dont care cause they miserable
School lil niggas
You could buy diamonds but I could play wit words thats a jewel lil nigga
Tongue sharp like a sword
I could get ya fam killed just off my word thats the proper Art of War
Stay wit the Parker and the Porsche
I dont trust a soul cause niggas threw rocks up at the Lord
The cash aint right there the mask is right there
Niggas try P Ima blast em right there
You dont want ya right ear next to ya Nike Airs
Said Im from the darkside bringin the light here
Wha
This is how we live
Wha You know niggas
Second time around you know what time it is
This is how we live
Its all lyrics over here nigga
Feel me nigga
This is how we live
And Im in the hood for real all day all night shit like that
This is how we live
Yo Hav once again good lookin out for the beat nigga
This is how we live
SP the Ghost ONE
This is how we live
