I Know Lyrics
Heroin addict's arms got needles in it
Jails is packed, niggas is getting diesel in it
Streets is wild, niggas is all evil in it
A M16 to kill our people in it
Cocaine currency is calculated
A lot of wolves, but only the real alphas make it
If it's war, then the blood gon' flow
I might tell you some shit, but not all I know, yeah

I know the coke game, I know the dope game
I know the shooter, the jack boy, the whole game
I know the fast cars, I know the fast hoes
I know the niggas that hustle to get fast dough
I know the coke game, I know the dope game
I know the shooter, the jack boy, the whole game
I know the fast cars, I know the fast hoes
I know the niggas that hustle to get fast dough, I know
Summertime, fly niggas'll pull the whips out
Steppin' out the penthouse, the kush from the zips out
It's usually Black Label if I'm dipped out
Hit the strip, make sure it gets shipped out (Make sure)
Dior, drinkin' Pinot Noir, about to open up The Carter
Played Nino before, yeah, I've seen it before
Niggas'll kill you with the nina for raw
Mama singin' Tina Turner, tryna smile 'cause we poor
Me, I'm with the Bimmer with boys that make noise (We make noise)
Yeah, the money is real, but we dealin' with fake joy (Fake joy)
Ask me while I'm smokin' the tan in St. Croix (Ask me)
Tryna move around the world while dealin' girl and the boy (Woo)
Pink diamonds like Pink Panther
Never ask the question that the missin' link answers (Never)
Cuban link, big knots and thick dancers (Big knots)
This the fast life, sick like cancer

I know the coke game, I know the dope game
I know the shooter, the jack boy, the whole game
I know the fast cars, I know the fast hoes
I know the niggas that hustle to get fast dough
I know the coke game, I know the dope game
I know the shooter, the jack boy, the whole game
I know the fast cars, I know the fast hoes
I know the niggas that hustle to get fast dough, I know

Ridin' out again, I said, "Fuck 'em all" (Ride)
Shoot a nigga first, watch the sucker fall (Watch 'em)
Yeah, I move squares, but I love to ball (I love it)
More than six fouls in this game, nigga, fuck a call (Fuck a call)
Lot of cops on the block, try to duck 'em all (Duck, nigga)
Lot of gunshots, nigga, better duck 'em all (Duck, nigga)
Lot of models in this party here for suckin' off
Lot of rich niggas really tryna fuck 'em all (Yeah)
Broke niggas mad, stuck on the wall (Mad)
They don't live this life, they don't really love 'em all (They don't love 'em all)
You ask me, I say fuck 'em both (Fuck 'em both)
.45 with the grip, that's rubber close (Keep it close)
Keep my enemies and my brother close (Yeah)
You ain't high the first time, fuck it, take another dose (Take another dose)
And there will never be another Ghost (Never)
I'm my brother's keeper, fuck around and get your brother smoked (Fuck around)

I know the coke game, I know the dope game
