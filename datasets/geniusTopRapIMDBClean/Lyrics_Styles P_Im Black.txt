Im Black 
Whether Im poor or rich or rich or poor
Though its all the same shit
Im Black 
Even though my skins kind of light
That means my ancestors was raped by somebody white
Im Black 
So I like to sing dance and crack jokes
Eat good food and be around black folks
Im Black 
Sort of like the Holys on Sundays
Drink all night and still go to work monday
Im Black 
So I like the kids looking real nice
Cuz Ive been poor and I know what it feels like
Im Black 
And Imma say it loud like James Brown
People be proud cuz we all up in the game now
Im Black 
And Imma hold my right fist real high
Might see my man and we might get real high
Im Black 
And I know it and I aint afraid to show it
Im Black 
And Im a genius and a motherfuckin poet
You know it
Ohh Ohhh 
Chorus  Floetry 
So proud to be just who Iam
So proud to say that Im me
So proud to be just who Iam
So proud to be so free
Im Black 
So proud to say that I made it
Im Black 
The one who struggled in the hatred
Im Black 
And Im not afraid to say it
Im BlackCuz I know Im Sinking 
Im Black 
So I got a heart full of bravery
Do for my peoples that went through slavery
Im Black 
So you know Im young in the sports
Nintey percent chanced I get hunged in the Court
Im Black 
Dont you be scared of me Mister
Cuz you dont really seem to be scared of my sister
Im Black 
And I can ride first class too
Or buy an exotic car and like murk past you
Im Black 
And I dont need a tan in the winter
Mind strong and powerful not a I cypher cant enter
Im Black 
And I dont need jewelry to shine
Look in my skin color is like the jewelry is blind
Im Black 
They focus on the negative attention
Do something positive and never get mentioned
Im Black 
Listen its a fact original man
I wouldnt change it if I could and thats that

Chorus Floetry 
So proud to be just who Iam
So proud to say that Im me
So proud to be just who Iam
So proud to be so free
Im Black 
So proud to say that I made it
Im Black 
The one who struggled in the hatred
Im Black 
And Im not afraid to say it
Im Black 
Im BlackIm BlackOhhYeahYeah 
Im Black 
Even with a caramel complextion
Look in the mirror see Malcolm and Martin reflection
Im Black 
Just like the PANTHERS looking for an answer
Its prejudice shit is like a cancer
Im Black 
Look in my eyes the wool cant get pulled over
Look in my cars and stay gettin pulled over
Im Black 
Me the public enemies number one
Government looking in the hood sending in the gun
Im Black 
I grew up off the good time show
Drink liquor smoke weed and let the good times roll
Im Black 
I live for my wife and my seeds
And my mom with a bond only God can acceed
Im Black 
I got to show my homeboys love
First thing you learnt in the hood is homeboy love
Im Black 
And Im mad if I aint nuthin else
Im Black 
Im beautiful and I love myself  Say together 
YEAH  Love myselfOhh yeah 
Chorus Floetry 
So proud to be just who Iam

Im Black 
The one who struggled in the hatred
Im Black 
And Im not afraid to say it
