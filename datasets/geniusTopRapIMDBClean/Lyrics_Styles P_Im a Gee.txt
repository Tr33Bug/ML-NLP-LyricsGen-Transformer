Most of us came from a broken home
Drownin in my sorrow drinkin liquor tryin to smoke alone
Argue with my wife so I broke my phone
Threw it on the wall tryin to ball but they playing zone
Connect is acting funny with the work
Like my money didnt work they gon end up getting merked
The label acting funny with the deal
Like the shit that I be spittin on the record wasnt real
Hood mad but they know a nigga ride
But the anger and jealousy can blow a nigga high
The other day I said I know a nigga fucked
When I played the bodega it was two dollars for the Dutch
To keep it real we living in real time
And I feel a niggas pain but they never can feel mine
And so Im on the go with the green light
I dont even sleep how the fuck could I dream right
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh but Imma do me you can say whatever
Im a G
Ghost never on that swag shit
Guess its a sad thing my tarot card is magic
I remember I aint never have shit
December was cold but February was drastic
So pardon my niggas and what they traffic
Or if they seem cold when the murder scenes tragic
Niggas can talk shit we dont even glimpse
Niggas can get hit we dont even wince
Come with an entourage and I dont mean Vince
Purple ape in a purple Porsche of course Im playing Prince
Or looking through the sky light my light
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights
Blowin on a long Dutch inhale
How I lie Id rather die than be in jail
Its all good til its all bad
And the ugly niggas gon crash your broads pad
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh but Imma do me you can say whatever
Im a G


I keep it moving in my new JOs
On them blocks where them young boys move llello
They salute like Whattup OG I salute
Cause its the Wild Wild West like Kool Moe Dee
What they do for a twodoor B and a nice watch
Blow your brains out when the cocaine price drop
Like yeah I know my man got life ock
The game dont stop so pull the weed out your nike sock
Yeah Its like that aint it
My down South niggas that got the Lex painted
My East coast niggas that got the Benz kitted
Dont it hurt when they snitch and you found out your friends did it
I thought its money over bitches but
Niggas throw money at bitches so lets kick it
If you really live by the G code
Shoot a couple of guns hurry up and reload
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh but Imma do me you can say whatever
Im a G
