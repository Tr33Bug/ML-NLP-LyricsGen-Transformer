Iâ€™m a Gee Lyrics
Most of us came from a broken home
Drownin' in my sorrow, drinkin' liquor, tryin' to smoke alone
Argue with my wife so I broke my phone
Threw it on the wall, tryin' to ball, but they playing zone
Connect is acting funny with the work
Like my money didn't work, they gon' end up getting merked
The label acting funny with the deal
Like the shit that I be spittin' on the record wasn't real
Hood mad but they know a nigga ride
But the anger and jealousy can blow a nigga high
The other day I said I know a nigga fucked
When I played the bodega, it was two dollars for the Dutch
To keep it real, we living in real time
And I feel a nigga's pain but they never can feel mine
And so I'm on the go with the green light
I don't even sleep, how the fuck could I dream right?
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; but I'mma do me, you can say whatever
I'm a G

Ghost, never on that swag shit
Guess it's a sad thing my tarot card is magic
I remember I ain't never have shit
December was cold but, February was drastic!
So pardon my niggas and what they traffic
Or if they seem cold when the murder scene's tragic
Niggas can talk shit, we don't even glimpse
Niggas can get hit, we don't even wince
Come with an entourage and I don't mean Vince
Purple ape in a purple Porsche, of course I'm playing Prince
Or looking through the sky light, my light
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights
Blowin' on a long Dutch, inhale
How I lie I'd rather die than be in jail
It's all good 'til it's all bad
And the ugly niggas gon' crash your broad's pad

Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; but I'mma do me, you can say whatever
I'm a G
You might also like
I keep it moving in my new J.O.'s
On them blocks, where them young boys move llello
They salute like "Whattup O.G.?" I salute
Cause it's the Wild Wild West like Kool Moe Dee
What they do for a two-door B, and a nice watch
Blow your brains out when the cocaine price drop
Like yeah I know my man got life ock
The game don't stop so pull the weed out your nike sock
Yeah! It's like that ain't it?
My down South niggas that got the Lex painted
My East coast niggas that got the Benz kitted
Don't it hurt when they snitch and you found out your friends did it?
I thought it's money over bitches but
Niggas throw money at bitches so let's kick it
If you really live by the G code
Shoot a couple of guns, hurry up and reload

Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; but I'mma do me, you can say whatever
I'm a G1Embed
