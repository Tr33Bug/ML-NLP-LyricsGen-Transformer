Its the tone Kiss
Im lookin for the tone

A pound of weed four guns and a liter of booze
Shootin niggas out they shoes  What  come and fuck with me
I could guarantee youll be makin the news
P flows like no nigga twentysix but Im a old nigga
Dont make me fuck around and show niggas
How to leave a room flat twenty niggas dead
No money no jewels bullets in they head
Aint a nigga you know could fuck with the god
I said rap was just a hobby gun bustin the job
Cause the sickest niggas out is the bitchest niggas out
And I could take em on the street and straight whip em in they house
Come through in the prettiest Porsche the grittiest boss

Motherfucker when its time to splatter your mask or burst your kidneys
So go head and get your sons on me
Like I give a fuck like Im givin up I got four guns on me
Get down and dirty all by my lonely
I leave your brains on your block all around your homies
Live by the code of honor stay holdin armor
I treat beef like a album I promote the drama
Stay bustin a hammer sweatin and smilin
And make sure these motherfuckersll regret while Im wildin

With money on his mind and some bricks in his hand P cant be stopped what

You could sleep if you want and get fucked with this toast in your ass
Im a gangsta and a gentleman I hope you the best
And tell you play the front seat and then choke you to death
Throw the gun to the chair try to open your chest
Get blood on the driver face window and dash
Burn the car with the body in it bring you to ash
I get down on a hit like Im Sigel the cold
A nigga sniffed up your coke I could bring you his nose
If he stole money from you P could bring you his hands
The nigga talk too much Ill bring the ears of his mans
Need weed to calm down need money to live life
Fuck a watch cause my time is tickin
Fuck a chain Im already hangin
Fuck a gang Im already bangin
Robbin niggas is my only form of steady payment
Play it sweet I might be in your house
