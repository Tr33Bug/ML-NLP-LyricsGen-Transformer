Lot of people mad I aint dead yet
SP comin through your speakers and headsets
Streets is in the buildin whenever the Ghost in it
I remember cereal boxes with roaches in it
Im a double G thats a gangster and gentleman
Humble was nights I been homeless cold and tremblin
You dont wanna touch me cant hold no gremlin
Gargoyle like Chow Yun Fat in Hard Boiled
Better stay away cause Im toxic hoch spit
Right in your face and bang you out like the moshpit
Heard I put in the work it wasnt no gossip
The man with the plan so you know that the plot thick
Clip on reserve for whoever deserve
I swear to God thats my word that Im off of the curve
So you should know Im in it to win it
If it start with a 3 end with an 8 Im in it to spin it
I like European cars and Im into the spinach
Fuck around you wont even get to finish the minute
Cause it could be over in two seconds with two weapons
Think I really care about whatever your crew reppin
Im in it to win it you motherfuckers aint pay no dues
I dare you walk a day in my shoes
Im in it to win it Im on a strip tryin to move these bricks
But the streets wont let me quit
Im in it to win it you best believe Im on my grind
You feel my pain in every verse and line
Im in it to win it years end and Im still goin hard bitch
Knowin that these rappers is garbage
Im in it to win it
Uhh yes I is the best I is
Go hard like that Bedstuy kid nigga Im in it to win it
Momma said be the best I is
I burn shit down just like Left Eye did
Uhh the game dont stop the pain dont stop
Bullets rip through his skull like a Drano shot
Got a strip for me to eat on P name the spot
I take aim at any nigga  who  name or not
For my handtohand niggas five gram niggas
Blamblam niggas you know who it is  Bully bitch
Gun ready for any nigga who want it
Slam me I dont think so Im fo hundred  ha ha 
Yeah Im sittin in my Phantom
Nah Im lyin Im hustlin tryin to get a Phantom
You dont really understand him
Fivestar general tenhut nigga get your face cut
I do the knowledge if the cypher work
But ask the homie that the knife insert what life is worth
When his heart pumps slow and his blood that he burp
And its all type of shit on his shirt
And his girl and his mom look hurt
And he thinkin bout his seed but he layin in the hospital leavin the Earth
They say real men pray for they enemies
Forgive but dont forget so I dont slip when Im drunk off Hennessy
Blame that all ridiculous
Hoodyd up in the cut inconspicuous
Nina gon burn them boys just like syphillis
Cross me Imma show em all what trippin is
The difference is Im a real G dont wanna make no noise
Got a conscience to really wanna take them boys
To a place they never been or go again
You could blame the wind cause look what its blowin in
SP the Ghost here we go again know that Im goin in
You aint doin nothin but goin out
My guns like a candle who dare me to blow it out
All these rappers garbage who want me to throw em out
What
Im in it to win it
Im in it to win it
Im in it to win it
