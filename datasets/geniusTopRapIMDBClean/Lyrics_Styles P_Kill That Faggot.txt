Liveson
The ghost
All the weed smoke bustin my lungs
Im in the whip with the 8dollar bottle only trustin my gun
You would think I was born in the pot the way my blood boil
Put ya brain in the dirt and call it thug soil
Flow til your sick of me what up
So if yyour Catholic get ya Rosary Muslims get your thicker beads
Yeah thats a real thug
I like to pray when Im high the weed is my shek the blunt is my prayer rug
P aint got a religion
Yeah I believe in God but Im harder than the cops in the prison
And Im glad that the LOX made it
Im in the parkin lot gun on my waist while I get intoxicated
You would be surprised all the drugs that I operated come through your block

If Ghost got telepathy the shine in the dark side
Disappear in the light yall want the recipe
You think Im sleepin dawg this is Styles
If Im lookin in the sky Im tryin to find a cloud to creep in
Come back when it rain again you could get my drift on
Understand my science then Ima spit the pain again
You cant sing with the angels you chat wit a demon
Im as loud as the gat that Im squeezin adapt for the heathens
Told you Im the lord of the slums

Pll go to war but I aint got a ounce of energy
Die for my ace goons live for the younger me
You could look in my eyes and see where the hunger be
Blood sweat and tears been dropped dip your bowl in it
But what make this shit bad I put my soul in it
Fuck you fuck them
Yall aint got honor respect the customs
Niggas dont want me to flip but I dont stand still
Been made my decision how I was livin
A couple of years ago when I learned how a few grand feel
Its my time to grind my turn to burn
