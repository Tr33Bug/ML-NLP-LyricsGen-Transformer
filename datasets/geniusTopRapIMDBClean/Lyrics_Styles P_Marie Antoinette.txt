Kill all of these rappers homie its too ill
I am in the Matrix but never takin the blue pill
From Son of Sam town
If they aint got the ratchet get a hatchet or gas the car to run a man down
Not a camera but a hammer so run when it pan round
Cause you dont stand there when they gunnin a man down
Unless you the clown that came to catch the spare round
If you pull it then you know how a bullet through air sound
Sicker than sickin a dog on a sick man
Shoot it out with all of these rappers not have shit planned
Put five in the startin five six in the sixth man
Whoever come off of the bench is gettin drenched
Beat his face to a dent like I was Raid or Ip man
The Ghost back this them old raps in a new me
But new me is older than the old me
Which would make the new me retarded
See your face and I blow heat Ghost nigga
Wanna meet up with the Reaper Ill introduce you to him
Set me on a blind date once I hit Medusa for em
Wise man can see that a peasant has a king in em
Dance wit the devil but never for you to sing wit em
Run wit a demon but never for you to cling to em
See the angle all of the angels aint got wings to em
Me I go black when they challenge my G
I blow my soul out the challenge tryna balance my chi
Channel my rage or its Animal P
Yeah he plantbased but he could lead this room on a cannibal steez
You aint fuckin with the Phantom you see
If you dont cause I knocked your eyes out for your family to see yeah
Wack rappers shouldnt be breathin at least not a rhyme
Fuck about your set my nigga throw up a dollar sign
Five niggas ten guns right up in the Impala ride
Playin Spotify tryna spot a guy then a shotll fly
All twenty in them shits yeah its homicide
You can get the picture bitch I aint got to dramatize
I aint take drama class askin where the scarma at
Hash in it askin shit like where his baby momma at
My hood it get terrible
And the wrong territory leads to a burial
Fucked up scenario
Back on that shit loadin up yeah here we go
Comin through the strip niggas skip like there they go
Air holes in everything we pack we prepared to go war like its overseas
Kill em if its over cheese or principles
You tried to violate what I oversee
Stick em like a boar with a hawk watch em overbleed
