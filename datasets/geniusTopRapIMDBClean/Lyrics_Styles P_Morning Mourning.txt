Bill The Butcher Cutting Is this it Priest The Popes new army
A few crusty bitches and a handful of ragtags
Priest Vallon Now now Bill you swore this was a battle between warriors not a bunch of Miss Nancies
So warriors is what I brought
A cold heart and a hot slug is not love
Them boysll pop up leave you chopped up
Its a lot of pussy niggas but its not us
Got cuffed why you think Im frontin in a drop truck
Grind and I work real hard wasnt pot luck
Lotta work in the pot couple niggas was shot up
The glorifyin times of the horrifyin crimes
But the more I see the soft shit the more that Im inclined
To let the real niggas know its all about the shine
Let em get it in the sun get your gun when the moon fall
Soon Ill tell the goons meet the Ghost by the pool hall
Cause when the rules get lost its a fools fall
Take a smart man to get in on a smooth course
Singin You Will Never Find by Lou Ross
Thinkin can I live Now the crib got two floors
Cant snooze off nor take my shoes off
Lotta niggas is rude that shitll throw your mood off
Lotta niggas is cruel tryna cut your fuel off
Watch your ride die no jump for you
They aint pump you up but I bet you they got a pump for you
Right hand said he would dump for you
Then he went left are you deaf They on the hunt for you
Maybe you just blind or maybe you just fine with gettin lined
Cause you pussy by design what
Mama told me to pray in the mornin  To pray 
Been stuck here in this place too long  Been stuck here in this place too long 
God forbid we dont make it to the mornin
In the rain that I died could be found in my moms eyes
See the pain under her veil while she mournin  she mournin she mournin 
Dont wait to pray til the morninthe mornin
Cause you might not make it homemake it home
Yeah you die if you violate eyes dilate
Blowin weed tryna vibrate
Thirtyeight in my size nines win the TriState
Swim with the sharks you a killa or you live bait
Considered a titan although Im only fiveeight
Born in the jungle made it out I survived hate
Run with gorillas bang my chest like Im a primate
Consider me a land pirate that knows the pie rate
Get lined without a ruler a nine at your medulla for a lil bit of moolah
Found his body chopped up in Mexico in the cooler
Right next to a shooter and his best friend
It aint chess but they put him in check then
If you know the math on the wrath he is less than
From the south side but I hustle on the west end
Pain and that stress gon kill you if its kept in
Ghost nigga
