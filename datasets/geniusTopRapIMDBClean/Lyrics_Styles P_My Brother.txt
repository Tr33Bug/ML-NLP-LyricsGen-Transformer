Answering machine  Im not the only one living here
Please be considerate and leave a nice message after the tone One
Styles  I just wanted to speak to him I got too much words
I got a lot of words lets see yo yo
Life is a circle of pain
The darkest clouds end up like the purplest rain
They say patience is a virtue in the game
Fuck it I guess I died when my brother died
Cause to tell you the truth I feel like Im the curse in the game
My vision is blurred dreams is shattered my heart is broke
Pain so deep I find it hard to cope
Missin your smile and missin your style
I figured Im the next one dead so we could kick it a while
Cause your name lives on the sun still shine
Every time your baby mom lift up your child
I guess I gotta switch my angle now
Take a positive look hit a blunt my little brothers with the angels now
Some of us fall and some of us fly
But at the end of the book baby all of us die
Word my nigga
Theres my brother
I could smile cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophets and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin the sky
Theres my brother
I could cry for the fact I cant hug him no more
But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me
And the good thing is he aint got to worry no more
I said theres my brother with Allah
Best place he could be
If I could get my miracle on
Listen to me I would bring my brother back in the physical form
Cause the spirit still here but the visual gone
And sometimes I gotta think if Imma live to the morn
I guess its no more schooling you
I know its something in our blood that kept us niggas in the street as usual
Left with a robbery charge pack and a stash
Crushed a lot of niggas thatd happened to gav
But Imma just light a blunt look in the clouds
And Imma ask my little nigga whats happening Hav
You died on Mothers Day mom its a gift
I know God took my brother cause his honor and strength
And we all gonna die Allah tally us up
While you there say whats up to Lil Malla and Duck
And I know yall niggas restin in peace
You might be gone but your soul is still here and is blessin the streets
Theres my brother  My niggas 
I could smile cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophet and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin the sky
Theres my brother  My brother 
I could cry for the fact I cant hug him no more
But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me
And the good thing is he aint got to worry no more
I said theres my brother with Allah
Best place he could be
I could see you when Im all alone  I see you 
So I guess Im not all alone I know my little nigga callin home
The good die young so they could get to heaven early
And watch over the rest of the slums  watch over us please 
Move the clouds so we could see the rest of the sun
You mightve died but you in heaven thats a blessing in one
