Yeah it is what it is
Tell em aint no me
Feel me
Vinny Idol nigga
Streets know the aura Tommy guns fedoras
Watch for the creeps the peeps on the corner
Mommy read Genesis I cred the Torah
Supposed to be righteous but I love the horror
Was thrilled by crime
I cant believe I let a motherfuckin dollar bill kill my mind
Dull my senses steal my shine
It took a strong will from me to heal my mind
Still Im blind cause still I grind
This aint Astrology but feel my sign
Ghost walk his path align feel his rap align
Cause I kick shit that make the pastor cry
Weed pacify or pass the time
Got the soul of a slave with a mastermind
Get real ill make a statue cry
Cause gettin real deep thats a knack of mine
But fuck accolades blow a splif and get kicks off a  page
Homie put the MAC away
You either live or you die slow
Might you burn Os and hide dough from 50
Im John Doe in the Tahoe
Glow in the dark how a sparkll leave your mind blown
My times up in your time zone still on the flow but my nigga Im a ride on
Ghost
I be on my own shit all about that dough shit
Greedy mother fucker on that low shit
I be on my own shit all about that dough shit
Grease a eightyeight thats that blow shit
I be on my own shit
This is all from the school of hard knocks
From Wyo to Far Rock Im the nigga they play on the hard blocks
Whats the meaning of time when you lookin at God clock
Speakin on the patterns in the sky
Niggas make rules up and break em but Im adamant with mine
Catalyst for crime talk shit Im shatterin your spine
Cause I aint get a ladder for the climb
Nah no ropes no hikin shit
Had to play Valhalla on some vikin shit
But never snitch gone on the deal
Live niggas keep it real go out on they shield
No longer doin crime but I could pass a line
Take a couple points hit a joint that is by design
Tradition kept surprised a lotta niggas aint missin yet
Just cause they aint listen yet
I know they deaf but they aint get the vision yet
Who am I to judge
Only robe I wear is from the telly on the balcony
Blowin on the bud
And I aint got a ego I could show a nigga love
I got a Desert Eagle that could show a nigga mud
Dick in the dirt floor wet cause of the blood
To tell the truth nigga I rather give you a hug
And you just mad cause of the plug
I know what it is not what it was
I be on my own shit all about that dough shit
Greedy mother fucker on that low shit
I be on my own shit all about that dough shit
Grease a eightyeight thats that blow shit
I be on my own shit
