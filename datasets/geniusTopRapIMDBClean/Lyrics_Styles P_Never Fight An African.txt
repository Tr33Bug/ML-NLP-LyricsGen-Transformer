Shout to all the real niggas
Die for the cause yeah I will  I will 
I used to do crime for the thrills and all for the bills
With a white man face from a black slum
Like Im gon need a white man place
Im a brown king why I need the white man grace
I just need to pray so I can get the right mans grace
Thats the God up above
My people mud colored but dirt from the earth
So I know that we made of love
Soak up the sun like a sponge  Soak it up 
Dance for the rain we are one  We dancin 
We all of the elements with all of the resonance
I like em dead if we speakin on presidents
Not a Trump supporter not a Clinton supporter
And Obama slipped too we need to get it in order  Facts 
I let the truth and the facts out
Lets turn the White House to a glass house
But fuck politics pull the hash out
And the peace pipe
I came from the streetlights to the limelight tryna eat right
And if one brother starves we aint eat right
Treat man kind cause Im part of mankind
Never talkin dirt burner or landline
Cross me thats like steppin on a landmine
I am outside with my folks tryna man mine
I aint no house nigga I been in the fields
Where Im from niggas run when they see a shield
Everybody know the deal
If you get knocked by the cops when you locked you dont get no appeal
Time to levelup and fuck the Devil up
Im at peace with my brother Im puttin the metal up
If you owe me then show its time to settle up
Forty acres and a mule in a Porsche just set it up
Let me give you a little insight
You are still black if your skins light
You are still black if your skins white
But forget about skin types focus on the facts
Historyll make the whole world black
Yeah the whole world round
God is the king and we could all get a crown
Ghost
