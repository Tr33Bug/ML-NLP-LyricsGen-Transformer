Load up hahahahaha 
Why cant you be man enough
Yeah where you at nigga 
Tell me where you coming from
Load up nigga wooo HAHAAAEEH 
Yo cant really figure this clown out
Where is he from Jamaica Queens Cali or down South
I could let a LA gun hit him
But Grape Street already told me you payin to run with em
I could let a New York knife poke him with one of my throw aways
But I dont want to see no cops smoke him uhh
Somebody tell Pa we ridin
And get ready to auction off the car he die in  eBay 
Never we bump heads since you like havin people with you
Get you a hospital with bunk beds
Without Dr Dre you would just make slow jams
Come up out of that witness protection program
Hov dont really respect you get in your place
If BIG was alive hed probably spit in your face
Nas was doing just fine without you  Esco 
And Pac probably wouldve made an album about you
So I guess that just leaves me here to get rid of you
And Rakim and them they dont even consider you
Em know you aint got nothin for Jada
And I know he appreciates all the money you made him
Its two thousandfive nobody fights fair
I just know an instrumentals your worst nighmare
But you tough and you bad too bad you mad
Probably been in your old hood more than you have
Yeah you sold more records than me
But in the streets you gon always be second to me
We was damn near feelin you
Even though your career is based off somebody damn near killin you
Shit you be doing aint even considered rappin to us
This is probably the best thing that happened to us
The best Wanksta internet gangsta
Magazine mobster shit on your whole roster
Get ready to say Hail Marys and Our Fathers
Get out your black suits and hard bottoms
Haha dont worry I got him
He aint a problem child just a child with a problem
Why cant you be man enough
We love it nigga lets go 
Tell me where you coming from
DBlock dont think it nigga
Take a piss in your Formula 50 drink it nigga
Get shot out the Reeboks nigga
Got shot and aint shoot none back youse a biatch nigga
If I wouldve got shot on grandmas stoop
I wouldve had somebody grab my duke right
In the streets they say 50 who shot ya
Named three niggas soon as he came out the doctor
And you far from a gangsta nigga
You was talkin bout yourself when you made Wanksta nigga
Listen why work out cock guns on the DVD
Run around with cops from homicide and TNT
Nigga you can suck my dick
Come around without cops shits on you gon get touched quick
Cause I was at the VIBE when it jumped off
Put fifty grand up you pussy you aint even lift a hand up
Your man stabbed somethin police grab somethin
But besides that I aint seen nobody man up
Shit what the plot is about
Cause you know that you dont need a dentist to get shot in the mouth
And the hood hate ya shit but you hot in the south
Its the crackers that buy the album whats the plottin about
Many Men make a wish but we aint many men
So you gon get death when we let them semis spit what


Why cant you be man enough
Tell me where you coming from
Why cant you be man enough
Tell me where you coming from
