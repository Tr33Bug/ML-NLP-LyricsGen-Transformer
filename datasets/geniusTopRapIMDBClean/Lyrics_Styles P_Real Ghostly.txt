Im forever spittin you is never spittin
If my man gonna ride Im gonna set it with him
If ya man gonna die you gettin deaded with him
When you hear my verses it was never written
And If you dont like my shit dont never listen
But if you tuned in make room then
Guns in every closet even the one the brooms in
Just like them cameras see that money and zoom in
Get it then I zoom out  laughs 
And they think Im blowin smoke out
Im really blowin fumes out howl when the moons out
Its the alpha male is my brain locked up or is it out on bail
Am I free yet Can I see yet
You dont understand you really aint a G yet
Im a gentleman Ill leave you tremblin
Rememberin the gremlins the guns need assemblin

Description of my existence real ghostly
Sort of like the ancient Egyptians
I could move objects without liftin so gifted
Still keep the spliff and the smithon
Never cross me like a Christian
Theres no distance far enough to stop my persistence
Like for instance I use my motherfuckin instincts
Me my gun my knife always stay in sync
I know shit stinks but keep ya nose up
Me I hold the block like the belt hold ya clothes up
I see his head down and his toes up
Theyll plant him but he never grows up
You dont wanna stumble now its a jungle now
Large aint big enough headed for humongous now
And If you head up theyll gun you down
They dont give a fuck if ya daughter or ya son around

Mind stay zoned out on the plane like I flown out
Gun game who got blown out
Drug game get ya car and ya home out
Cause the streets take the motherfuckin toll out
And Let a little bit of soul out Im tryna roll out
With a lot of cash to hold out
Cause I know bout what I know bout nigga no doubt
My whole life I went the dough route
