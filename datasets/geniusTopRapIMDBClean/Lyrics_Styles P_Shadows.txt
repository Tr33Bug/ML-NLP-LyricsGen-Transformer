I mean Sometimes I see things I guess cause Im a ghost I see ghostly things
Thought I saw something that wasnt there but it was there
Theyre as far as the eye can see
as far as I can see though 
There are shadows haunting me
I see shadows 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
and Im looking real far even if Im asleep 
There are shadows haunting me
aint that something 
Something in the shadows
Maybe its the Pharaohs
Coming to spread the light cause the visions so narrow
Maybe its the killas in the cut with the barrels
Getting high but cant fly without the eye of a sparrow
Fatigued and fatigue ready for battle
My word could move herd like the cattle
Try to stay hard lifes fragile meaning you could lose any moment
My cranium is like Damiens no Omen
I dont bare the mark of the beast
Just the heart of the beast
Rally for em when its dark in the streets
Just a ice cold nigga that be sparking the heat
Tryna make it through the struggle just to say at the least
If they coming tell em come now
Sunset sundown
I dont put my gun down
And I aint tryna run clown
I keep something in the barrels
Fully loaded up knowing theres something in the shadows
Theyre as far as the eye can see
Point blank period get high and hallucinate 
There are shadows haunting me
Stress is building up 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
I smell murder every time that the wind blows 
There are shadows haunting me
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling 
Something in the shadows maybe its the reaper
Maybe its the devil trying to put me in the sleeper
Maybe its God trying to tell me that Im deeper
Ill know soon have faith in a goon
I broke date mad years trying to race with the moon
If the sun give me energy
Why I pull my gun on my enemies
And wait for nightfall to drink Hennessy
Cups of Courvoisier times the same on this Swatch
Or Cartier unless you set your watch different
We got eyes but our watch different
Be on the block different
Be on the low in the spot different
I got bars but the Glock kicking
Im in tune with the moon
And the wolves that howl at it
You could play the game if you foul at it
Tell the pigs its a fair game
I get high and kick my Nike Airs off in first class on the airplane
I wont rest til the day I see the angel of death
And tell him wish me the best
If I dont get it this life may I get it the next
Never settle for less
Street niggas say I did it the best which is true though
Coke since the days of Menudo
Higher than Pluto
Something in the shadows but I aint got a clue though  I got no clue 
Im getting drunk off the booze
Im getting high just recording with Poose
Have dreams about the Lord and his crew
Or the devil and his boys
I have voices in my head but I can never make the noise stop  cant stop can it 
They always singing on a carol
Far as they can see know theres something in the shadows
