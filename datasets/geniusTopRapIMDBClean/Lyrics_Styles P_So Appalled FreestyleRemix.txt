So Appalled  FreestyleRemix  Lyrics
So sick of it
Run up in your crib just for the sake of stickin it
Yeah Im ridiculous
I know this is Kanyes track but Im kissin it
Still laughin at these cats like Im ticklish
Just somethin about that shit I like flippin it
The worlds back on my dick Im Mike Vickn it
Cock back and squeeze only right that you squirt off
Soon as I leave the building they turn the alert off
Only thing I need to know is can you knock the work off
Fifth Ave spendin crack money up in Bergdorf
Leave that boy alone I wouldnt recommend it
Half a mil worth of VVs independent
Everything is splendid all fine and dandy
Hoodrich is one point nine off the candy
sweat suit thermal on with the 
Grilled tilapia steamed salmon or the scampi
Snakes still squirmin haze off sherm and
Block is like the nickel boy days in the Vernon
Chrome fourfifn cause they still snitchin
The pools in the living room swim to the kitchen
Im so appalled Im better than em all
I rip an arena just like a hole in the wall
Spend a few stacks on some hoes in the mall
Real niggas is either in the hole or the morgue
Enemies is cool loved onesll hurt you
Dishonor before death yeah viceversa
Elegant performance my stash is enormous
Real talk New Yorks been mine for the longest
Strong onesll make it weak onesll suffocate
I keep it in the hood so its easy to resuscitate
Lifes like a milk crate nothin like a beach kid
Good cardigan over the Trues nice feetwear
Yeah
Yeah
Hustle like an African mother from the motherland
Work in the ziplock money in the rubber band
If the cops dont blitz then Im lucky
I want the eighth floor of the Ritz like Nucky
Empire like AC from KC
Kitchen cook step up in the spot all the bitches look
Eastbound down like Kenny Powers
Bricks is in the Dodge Neon but its Hemipowered any hour
This could be a sevendigit flip
Send a kite to the bing to get seven niggas ripped
Get the top ten list and get seven niggas clipped
I used to just ride on the seven bus
Now I let it bubble like SevenUp
That was five sevens you could die with a three in front
Need money need pussy need liquor need a blunt
Wanna fuck with me nigga You gon need a gun
Money over bitches but respect over money though
Loyaltyll have you on the boat to the bungalow
What you know about eatin with the old man
Tell the truth this rap shit wasnt in the program
Sittin on crates to pickin up weight
You gotta lift open the crate tryin to get my niggas straight
Ridiculous I would even say this on tape  Ayo Kiss 
And you say New York City that the world is very different now
Gunlight is my phone real easy to lift it now
Im so appalled
Shoot the pallbearers at your motherfuckin funeral and treat em like dogs
Cause its a motherfuckin war
Nigga DBlock Act like ya know bitch
