Yeah Holiday Gary
I dont want yall to compare me to niggas no more
Unless they got a case pending
Unless they poke somethin up
Unless they keepin it real gutter yknow
SP Im the closest thing to poison it is
You think you hot Imma boil your kid
You think you cool Imma throw you in the river wit some cement shoes
You could sleep with the fishes
Niggas actin funny so I gotta keep it movin I dont speak to the bitches
We could handle this like gangstas
Dog Ill kidnap your little man and send you to the banker
That money get dropped off so do E
Right off the booth of his mama building
Feel the drama building
Told yall niggas dont fuck wit P
I said fuck rappin a verse
I get down like the bishops wit the way you clap at the hearse
I get it crunk wit a blunt and a package of work
Im in the shottie of the Cadillac
Wit niggas thatll take twenty a body the shottie will handle that

Im knockin this ash off the dutch on the roof of your Benz
My lil man been runnin since the shootin begin
Yall niggas talk about cases of Crist
I talk about cases where niggas get life of the shit
And your girl visit two years mom come forever
But near one of your mans aint right wit his shit
But like who am i to flip Smokin weed influenced by the flicks and the old timers with the toolie by their hip
So come and creep wit me
And I aint lyin when I tell these motherfuckers
That I got the streets in me

So be about your business when you come and beef wit me
I got coke for sale and I got dope for sale
If you wanna cop some work you oughta come and speak wit me
