Spend a day with the Ghost baby
Get the understandin
Im like a shadow
Im the ghost of this shit for all the spirits I possess
All the voices I be hearin shit Im feelin in my chest
I could ghost through your walls and flow through your soul
When it comes to the streets dog I give this shit my all and
If Im not grabbin yall if you into signs then
Im a Sagittarius the magician is my tarot card
David is my first name but love it if you break it down
Im a real nigga Im a hug you if you breakin down
Styles is my last name meaning the expression of art
I guess why Im just blessed with the heart
And they call me Holiday Im a let the blanks fill in
I call myself that cause I was born on Thanksgiving
112874
Snatch you will I break bread with niggas that was ghetto or poor
P short for Peniro thats a mixture of Robert and Al
But I aint actin with a llama Im wild
Heres why they call me the ghost
Im half alive half dead and when its beef I bring all of the toast
Im the ghost of this shit I provide you fluid
Thatll crack the sidewalks and rise the sewers
Hey yo I can see my son in my face
Am I foul cause I pray when Im high or with a gun on my waist
Gots to ride for the criminals die for the generals
My ghostll be around for my bicentennial
Yall better do the article
Cause when Im dead I aint really gon die Im gon break down to particles
Probably too deep to blow
When I sleep I leave earth and come back yall cant peep the ghost
Its like I make niggas shiver and think
Im so deep that if water tried to listen then the riversll sink
And yall niggas cant walk with me Im on some different shit
I cant explain it but I hear the clouds talk to me
Its sort of like the weed in a dutch you wouldnt understand
So I stay quiet not leavin you much
Its about time I even it up I knock your spirit out
Holiday to Ghost gettin greasy as fuck
Heres why they call me the ghost
Im half alive half dead and when its beef I bring all of the toast
Im the ghost of this shit I provide you fluid
Thatll crack the sidewalks and rise the sewers

I vow to hold my niggas down bust my gun pay the bail
Get the weed get the liquor dog Im just a lick of styles
Lyrically Im somethin else hardest out of nothin else
Before you think Im bitch you better all try to fuck yourself
Mr Paniro and mixed with a pharoe and
Got cold hearted when I started movin heroin
Robbed more shit than Billy the Kid
You think youre nicer than the P you the silliest kid
Its like Im better off poppin ya
When I flow I got a formula in styles sort of like a philosipher
Yall start borrowin lessons
Cause rap without me is like the gods without the stars and the crescents
I dont rap my niggas I spit bars and baptize niggas
Pull guns and kill halfsized niggas
You heard about the Holy Ghost and took it for lies
Next time you see Paniro just look in his eyes nigga
Heres why they call me the ghost
Im half alive half dead and when its beef I bring all of the toast
Im the ghost of this shit I provide you fluid
Thatll crack the sidewalks and rise the sewers
