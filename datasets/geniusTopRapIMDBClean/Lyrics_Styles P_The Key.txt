It is the key to all the doors
Vinny Idol 
It is the key to all the doors
Focusing when I wanna quit
Understand I was raised on some other shit
Whats the pain to ya
Whats the name to ya
Whats shame to ya Whats the game and the fame to ya
These is the questions that I ask myself
Like the haze and the hashy for help
Or Courvoisier straight
A parking lot full of thugs and parking there late
It is the key to all the doors
Make moves but take time like a chess piece
Before I start the car four dimes to the chest piece
Windows aint the only things tinted
Niggas is too I been tryna blow but it might take me a minute
Shit time is money though
Im on the low but my ghost acting funny though
He saying chill nigga now you could build or you could kill nigga
That depend on your will nigga
My reply its the thrill nigga
I be seeking adventure
If I kill the starting 5 thatll weaken they bench up
Seek time in another frame
And Im thirsty for knowledge
What it really mean my mind got a hunger pain
Could I shine when it come to rain
And could it rain when I shine
Once in a while to keep me on a humble plane
It is the key to all the doors
It is the key to all the doors


Honor and respect
Llama in the bama check the drama in a sec
Think bout the days when we blew chocolate
Gin and tonic til the death
And niggas grew up fast and threw up cash
To get sneakers cars and clothes and who want blast
And this is our life we live this nigga
Sound trife but we did this nigga
It is the key to all the doors 
Just to breath out here is a motherfucking privilege nigga
It is the key to all the doors
Maintain and persevere through the hard times
But is it hard if I aint doing hard time
Work your ear hard rhymes through the God mind
Best on the street and I only do it part time
Flow is just the tip of the iceberg
Low when Im spitting them nice words
Get dough when Im hitting them right curbs
Live off of principle nigga
Complex but I try to keep it simple my nigga
I got to work on my physical and mental my nigga
Nowadays they bust shots at your temple my nigga
I said the streets dont love you back
So I sleep with a eye open hug my gat
Ima ride for my man Im a thug like that
Its family first
Its going down Ima blam you first
Step back you see the man at work you know
It is the key to all the doors
It is the key to all the doors
