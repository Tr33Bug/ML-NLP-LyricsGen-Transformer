The Life Lyrics
My life
Pharoahe Monch, Ayatollah
Howie McDuffie, Holiday Styles
Double R, Rawkus Records
Pharoahe, talk to 'em
Let 'em try to understand
Let 'em try, let 'em try now

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life
Is based on lightin' blunts, loadin' guns
Tellin' my lawyers to get the case gone
I need the bills that the presidents got they face on
So I could switch my residence
Get a truck and a Lex
Fuck a check, I no longer have to wait for 'em
I made a couple ends, lost a couple friends
I light a blunt 'cause never will the struggle end
So you could judge a nigga, but you ain't got it
You ain't in the role, so you really can't budge a nigga
You oughta love a nigga
For the fact that it's my world and my life, but still I'm a rugged nigga
They say, "You buggin' nigga," fuck it, I'm a thuggin' nigga
You talkin' bullshit then kick it with another nigga
I got a bigger bed and I need a cover, nigga
And I ain't got friends, I got enemies
So if they with me, then that means they my brother, nigga

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life
You might also like
Is a blunt to the head, a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin', scared of the feds
They said, "Death is eternal sleep"
But the only thing is you ain't really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get murked in the head, instead of big money
They got big mama hurtin' instead
My life is makin' the verse
But the handcuffs, the bullpens, the jail cells is makin' it worse
Tell mommy I don't go to the church
Tell ahk I don't go to mosque
I blow blunts, hold guns, and I'ma be right there when the soldiers'll march
I play my part and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things, it's still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and he'll be callin' me soon, what?
And my life is all I have
My family, my niggas, my flow, my grabs, what?

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life
