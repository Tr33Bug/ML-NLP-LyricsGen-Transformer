Pharoahe talk to em
Let em try to understand
Let em try let em try now
My life is all I have
My rhymes my pen my pad
And I done made it through the struggle dont judge me
What you say now wont budge me
Cause where I come from so often
People you grew up with are layin in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
Its my time now my world my life my life
Is based on lightin blunts loadin guns
Tellin my lawyers to get the case gone
I need the bills that the presidents got they face on
So I could switch my residence
Get a truck and a Lex
Fuck a check I no longer have to wait for em
I made a couple ends lost a couple friends
I light a blunt cause never will the struggle end
So you could judge a nigga but you aint got it
You aint in the role so you really cant budge a nigga
You oughta love a nigga
For the fact that its my world and my life but still Im a rugged nigga
They say You buggin nigga fuck it Im a thuggin nigga
You talkin bullshit then kick it with another nigga
I got a bigger bed and I need a cover nigga
And I aint got friends I got enemies
So if they with me then that means they my brother nigga
My life is all I have
My rhymes my pen my pad
And I done made it through the struggle dont judge me
What you say now wont budge me
Cause where I come from so often
People you grew up with are layin in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
Its my time now my world my life my life


Is a blunt to the head a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin scared of the feds
They said Death is eternal sleep
But the only thing is you aint really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get murked in the head instead of big money
They got big mama hurtin instead
My life is makin the verse
But the handcuffs the bullpens the jail cells is makin it worse
Tell mommy I dont go to the church
Tell ahk I dont go to mosque
I blow blunts hold guns and Ima be right there when the soldiersll march
I play my part and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things its still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and hell be callin me soon what
And my life is all I have
My family my niggas my flow my grabs what
My life is all I have
My rhymes my pen my pad
And I done made it through the struggle dont judge me
What you say now wont budge me
Cause where I come from so often
People you grew up with are layin in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
Its my time now my world my life my life
