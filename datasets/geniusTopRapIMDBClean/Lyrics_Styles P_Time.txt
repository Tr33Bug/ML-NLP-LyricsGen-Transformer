Time Lyrics
Gotta feel the vibes, you know?
Just go with it
Light somethin' up, turn this shit up, lay back
Listen to me, for real
Space Ghost, you know?
Hahaha, it's my time, as always (Vinny Idol, nigga)

If you kick it on the strip, you know the ticket on the grip
But them rat niggas is snitchin', get to flippin' on the clique
Pussy niggas is loud, with the blicker they'll rift
But golden niggas is silent when they lift it off they hip
Yeah, all you heard was a shot flew
Tried to get the lesson, but messages never got through
Why you think I'm rollin' the roaches up?
Probably on a island, my nigga, sippin' a coconut
Wasn't loc with us or broke with us
You ain't sleep on the floor, imagine you bein' woke with us
All I know is all dead bodies'll keep the vultures up
All of ya addiction is fiction, nigga, the pulp is up
OJ with the glove, Rosé in the tub
Connected with the Haitians, Peter Gatiens of the club (Hahaha)
A nation of gangsta niggas that always show me love
'Cause I came from the mud, yeah
Stay humble for thin lines
If he got the silk suit, then he came with the thin nine
I ain't workin' out shit, I ain't speakin' on gym time
I'm just prayin' that ya mind can shine like the rims shine, yeah
I illuminate like the moon glow
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, though
Short nigga, but make room though
I don't give a fuck if you came with a thousand goons, bro (Ghost)
I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)
Came— Came from the mud, yeah
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, though
I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)
Came— Came from the mud, yeah
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, though

You tryin' to be a nigga you was never not
Work that you never sold, guns that you never shot
Money that you never made, never handed out a fade
School of hard knocks, wasn't there, never got a grade
I was doin' dirt when Special Ed made "I Got It Made"
Somebody gettin' cut, face or gut, if I got a blade
Call my gun can, let it spray like I got a Glade
That was back then, not now, not nowadays
I used to have hammers everywhere
Smartened up 'cause they have cameras everywhere
Heard you on the grizz', niggas lyin', you was a teddy bear
Wolves come out when it snow, yeah, it's petty here
I take a quarter like the meter does
I'm doin' everything that a leader does
I'm doin' everything that a soldier does
You ain't play the jungle, you ain't know what a cobra was
Take a look at me, you ain't know what a nova was
Niggas wanna kill me, give a fuck, give a shoulder shrug
Show the holster, got the older snub
Wiz got the newer nine, thought these niggas knew the time (Ghost)

I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)
Came— Came from the mud, yeah
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, though
I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)
Came— Came from the mud, yeah
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, thoughEmbed
