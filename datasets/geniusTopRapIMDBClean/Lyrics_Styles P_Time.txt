Gotta feel the vibes you know
Just go with it
Light somethin up turn this shit up lay back
Listen to me for real
Space Ghost you know
Hahaha its my time as always  Vinny Idol nigga 
If you kick it on the strip you know the ticket on the grip
But them rat niggas is snitchin get to flippin on the clique
Pussy niggas is loud with the blicker theyll rift
But golden niggas is silent when they lift it off they hip
Yeah all you heard was a shot flew
Tried to get the lesson but messages never got through
Why you think Im rollin the roaches up
Probably on a island my nigga sippin a coconut
Wasnt loc with us or broke with us
You aint sleep on the floor imagine you bein woke with us
All I know is all dead bodiesll keep the vultures up
All of ya addiction is fiction nigga the pulp is up
OJ with the glove Ros in the tub
Connected with the Haitians Peter Gatiens of the club  Hahaha 
A nation of gangsta niggas that always show me love
Cause I came from the mud yeah
Stay humble for thin lines
If he got the silk suit then he came with the thin nine
I aint workin out shit I aint speakin on gym time
Im just prayin that ya mind can shine like the rims shine yeah
I illuminate like the moon glow
Doomsday is my day one I aint doomed though
Short nigga but make room though
I dont give a fuck if you came with a thousand goons bro  Ghost 
I I illuminate like the moon glow  Hahahaha 
Came Came from the mud yeah
Doomsday is my day one I aint doomed though
I I illuminate like the moon glow  Hahahaha 
Came Came from the mud yeah
Doomsday is my day one I aint doomed though
You tryin to be a nigga you was never not
Work that you never sold guns that you never shot
Money that you never made never handed out a fade
School of hard knocks wasnt there never got a grade
I was doin dirt when Special Ed made I Got It Made
Somebody gettin cut face or gut if I got a blade
Call my gun can let it spray like I got a Glade
That was back then not now not nowadays
I used to have hammers everywhere
Smartened up cause they have cameras everywhere
Heard you on the grizz niggas lyin you was a teddy bear
Wolves come out when it snow yeah its petty here
I take a quarter like the meter does
Im doin everything that a leader does
Im doin everything that a soldier does
You aint play the jungle you aint know what a cobra was
Take a look at me you aint know what a nova was
Niggas wanna kill me give a fuck give a shoulder shrug
Show the holster got the older snub
Wiz got the newer nine thought these niggas knew the time  Ghost 


I I illuminate like the moon glow  Hahahaha 
Came Came from the mud yeah
Doomsday is my day one I aint doomed though
I I illuminate like the moon glow  Hahahaha 
Came Came from the mud yeah
Doomsday is my day one I aint doomed though
