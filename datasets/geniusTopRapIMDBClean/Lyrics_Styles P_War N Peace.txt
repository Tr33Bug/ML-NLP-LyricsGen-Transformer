A calm wolf is still a wolf
Never confuse peace
Cant wait to buck a hunnid shots at the enemies ayy
Its like that
Shouldnt listen to the Ghost if you was never insane
Never the same once you learn to weather the pain
May you be never indicted never arraigned
Cant appreciate the sun if it never would rain
Respected by the Crips and the Bloods with the old flags
Ridin dirty ratchet on her but no tags
Keep your foot on the gas or you gettin a toe tag
Get a hole in your mask you aint able to draw fast
Ask God for a autograph knowin he draw fast
But how Im gon get it when Im on the warpath
I would battle the sun and the moon for more cash
I could humble myself if Im on the Lords path
Ima schizo maybe Im a psycho
Disciple of the night and all that is trifle
Exdope boy did all that was trifle
Im about peace but still got my rifle
Im about peace but Im with these hunnid shots buckin at my enemies runnin up the street
Im about war but Im with my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat
Im about peace but Im with these hunnid shots buckin at my enemies runnin up the streets
Im about war but Im bout my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat
Thinkin to myself I shoulda took my time
Left the dope game for rap shoulda took my lines
Get the city on my back never took my spine
Off the stoop by seven was a crook by nine
From the era where they screamed out Do that shit
Do that shit you had coke you moved that shit
Police chase got work yeah you threw that shit
Now its different got weed homie grew that shit
Sold a watch who you bout to drink Blued Out with
Play Suge get lined on some 2Pac shit
Two joints together Queensbridge oowop shit
Home invasion nigga I shoot niggas Guwop shit
You could die or chill yeah nigga two options
Im Lew Alcin or Bruce Lee
But its the Game of Death if you ever choose P
Im about peace but I need a few feet
Im about peace but Im with these hunnid shots buckin at my enemies runnin up the street
Im about war but Im with my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat
Im about peace but Im with these hunnid shots buckin at my enemies runnin up the streets
Im about war but Im bout my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat

Wolf is still wolf and I aint cryin wolf my nigga so you know that the wolf is gon eat
Loadin up a hunnid shots I aint but a hunnid shots buckin at my enemies runnin up the street
