We Thugs  My Niggas  Lyrics
All for one one for all
This is motherfucking beautiful
Talk to em baby
This for the cold Ds that wont snitch
For the murderers that wont miss
For the hustlers thatll front bricks
For the hoodrats that want chips
For the stickup kids creepin with they Pumps ripped
For lil shorty with his rhyme books
Black girls going to school carrying like 9 books
For the hood niggas
That go to work because parole but they tryin to be good niggas
For all the poor mothers
Thats always goin through the struggle still screamin that the Lord Love us
For the ghetto life
For having to hold your metal tight lookin for a better life


For the family
For if Im rich you rich and that shits a guarantee
For the best of life
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life
We thugs my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto my niggas
Any time any place we dont give a fuck we bust metal my niggas
We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
Watch what you sayin cause we shank you my niggas
We DBlock niggas we dont play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas
Aiyyo yo Imma shed blood for mine thats one ritual
Thats how you keep the love unconditional
Thats why we the only one the thugs listen to
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do
I know a few dudes doin life bids in jail
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale
But that how life is
And that how the gun and the knife is
Its a shame but its real when your enemies like ya
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper
Listen it aint the rappers its the rats that worry me
Double R for life DBlock til they bury me
Scared niggas shed off
Or stand way in the back and aim they gat up in the air and
Let off
Thorough niggas tear nigga head off then let the blood keep drippin
And just wipe the sweat off
Fuck with P the thugll come out
The slugll come out
You dont put in enough work I got chu
No doubt
They dont want Sheek to wild
Betta cover ya child
With two guns out the sunroof
Swordfish style
Who that kid
Black mask on with the latch on the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag
You get it in a hurry
All up in your Burberry
Through your assisstant
Through your fucking secretary
All yall do me a favor
Walk with me
If you want money or drugs
Talk with me
Know I got my niggas my guns
Now hawk with me
Guess who Jada P and The Sheek
Three bricks
Three whips
Three motherfucking ouies a week
Ten spots OT
Two blew off leak
My niggas cop
Pop and toss and we applying the pressure
So when you address us
Its Boss
Boss
And Boss
