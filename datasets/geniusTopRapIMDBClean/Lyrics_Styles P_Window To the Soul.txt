Vinny Idol nigga
Idol
We the hit nigga all the way
Zone the fuck out
I get higher go and leave earth
Before I do the verse I breathe in the weed first
A man with too many ones never put his needs first  never 
Just a little boy if you aint puttin your seeds first  little boy 
Dance with the devil in a den  I dance 
Im a soul of the earth I can transform the wind
Niggas say they righteous but they trans for the gin  Its what they say 
When you let em in the cypher then the cancer begins
My man said he God body I told him Im God soul  Im God soul 
On my mind do a chariot come with a console
Think it a paradise cause niggas is parasites
Vampire suck your blood right under the candle light
Back on my Ghost shit my nigga was Phantom Knight
Got wiser off the bud but it wasnt from Anaheim
Get this blood money dirty my hands is sanitized
Keep my eyes on the prize not things that tantalize
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house you should keep it in control
I aint die young and I aint gettin old
Im just livin in the present yeah thats my only goal
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house you should keep it in control
I aint die young and I aint gettin old
Im just livin in the present yeah thats my only goal
Peoplell text you prayer hands but wont say a prayer  pray for me 
Life is a bitch unexpected to be fair  ha 
Play the hand you was dealt if its wack keep the bet low  keep the bet low 
Wait for the next go
Calm then its Israeli arms dealers like Deathstroke
Strike like cobra  strike  or your life could be over if you let em shoot first  let em shoot first 
See my enemy tell you what I let em do first  Ill tell you what I do 
The answer is get murdered cause Im tryin to get further  ha 
Theres niggas who sell drugs but they wont flip a burger
Shit I was there too nigga I dont care to  I dont care 
Still crack the ground but now I move the air too  I make the air move 
Ride of my life but I aint got spare room  ride 
No spare tire the truth its a rare lie  rare 
Yeah my rhyme is a gunshot niggas could hear fire
And I dont fuck around with niggas that wear wires  uhuh 
Its the king of the slums yeah its David you hear Sia


Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house you should keep it in control
I aint die young and I aint gettin old
Im just livin in the present yeah thats my only goal
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house you should keep it in control
I aint die young and I aint gettin old
Im just livin in the present yeah thats my only goal
Hopin God see the the Lord in me  God 
On the grind only time move more than me  only time 
Only water could flow better
These niggas should know better but they dont act accordingly  uhuh 
Used to push the Honda Accord before tours scored raw
Moved work in the jects the fourth floor  facts 
Now we advance through the light we sold more  we sold more 
Gettin money every day without breakin the courts law
Ghost
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house you should keep it in control
I aint die young and I aint gettin old
Im just livin in the present yeah thats my only goal
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house you should keep it in control
I aint die young and I aint gettin old
Im just livin in the present yeah thats my only goal
