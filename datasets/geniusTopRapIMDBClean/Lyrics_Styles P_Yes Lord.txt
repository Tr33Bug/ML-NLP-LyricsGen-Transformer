Yes, Lord! Lyrics
Maestro while you listen to the bass drop

And you tried, then the fire never burnt my flesh (Burnt)
May I learn my lessons? May I learn my steps? (May I?)
I indulge in the dirt, yeah, I earned my mess (Mmm)
And I hurt a lot of people, I deserve my stress (I deserve my stress)
Showed a lot of people my worst who preferred my best
Man, you open up my eye and my third eye lex (Lord)
Then I saw too much, let my third eye rest (Saw too much)
Damn, such a foolish thing to do (So foolish)
You be blind to the truth, but the truth ain't blindin' you (Hahaha)
Yeah, a fool could figure that (Figure that)
Put my soul into the river, it told me it's swimmin' back (It's swimmin' back)
Mama prayin' for a safe night
Can't die from venom, I'm too used to snake bites (I'm used to snakes)
All these niggas see is my brake lights (Skrrt)
Used to the dark, I never come with a safe light (Never)
It goes wrong, it goes wrong
I know that my faith right (I know)
Uh, Lord forgive me, they offendin' me
Give a fuck how they feelin', can't match my energy
Conversations increasing, you ain't no friend of me
Lord, I mean, look at what you did to me, yeah
Lord forgive me, they offendin' me
Give a fuck how they feelin', can't match my energy
Conversations increasing, you ain't no friend of me
Yes Lord, I mean, look at what you did to me, Yes Lord

Yeah, it's marijuana and champagne
Need a Rollie made out of sand grains (Hahaha)
To tell time in a simulation (They don't get it)
For stimulation of fearing flames
For a long flow, even your mom know (She know)
I could die and come back like I was John Snow (Word)
Turn you John Doe, no time, no (No time)
Knew I was done when drug dealers pushed the Milanos

Uh, Lord forgive me, they offendin' me
Give a fuck how they feelin', can't match my energy
Conversations increasing, you ain't no friend of me
Lord, I mean, look at what you did to me, yeah
Lord forgive me, they offendin' me
Give a fuck how they feelin', can't match my energy
Conversations increasing, you ain't no friend of me
Yes Lord, I mean, look at what you did to me, Yes Lord

Drug dealers whippin' Milanos (Clean as fuck)
That's right around the time I couldn't get no McDonalds (Damn)
Then I hit the strip, start flippin' them bottles
Made a little money, smoke and sip in the bottle
Now I'm standin' outside like it wasn't tomorrow (I'm outside)
If the front ain't on my block, then you dip in them hollows (Just sayin')
And your mama would've said: "He ain't the nigga to follow" (I'm followin' him)
And she would've been right (She ain't right)
'Cause I wasn't right (Hahaha)
You won't get a buck fifty if I ain't on the fight (Get that buck fifty)
And I grew up real rough, did shit outta spite (South side)
If you know about the game then you'd get out tonight (Whateva)
'Cause I knew in my teens, but I stayed in my thirties (I stayed)
Yeah, the water is purified but the drinkers is dirty
Got a gun and it's certi
Another one in the birdie (Couple)
Give a fuck about a killer 'cause we all 730 (Give a fuck)
Yeah, I was tried by the fire so I arrived by the fire
Ghost

Uh, Lord forgive me, they offendin' me
Give a fuck how they feelin', can't match my energy
Conversations increasing, you ain't no friend of me
Lord, I mean, look at what you did to me, yeah
Lord forgive me, they offendin' me
Give a fuck how they feelin', can't match my energy
Conversations increasing, you ain't no friend of me
Yes Lord, I mean, look at what you did to me, Yes Lord3Embed
