Money hoes cars and clothes

Thats how all my niggas roll
Money hoes cars and clothes
Thats how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro 24s
Thats how all my niggas roll
Im in a droptop Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause Ive been dranking and Ive been smoking
And flying down 285 but Im focused
454 SS I race Porsches
White leather seats as fresh as Air Forces
I say Im doing bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on NWA Straight Outta Compton
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering Whats happening the kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
I aint Hollywood I come from the hood Im used to it
So if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Daytons got the Chevrolet skatin makin
I make a million and Im satisfied Ill get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tightest ride I want the best
I refuse to get a 9 to 5 Id rather flip my keys
Been paying my dues ever since 89 tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when Im on the scene they know its me
Aint no dream or no fantasy bitch its TIP
Broad busting like a baby do a binky
Five karat VVSs on my mothafuckin pinky
Half of Hennessy and Belvederes what we drinking
Pimp squad send for broads what the hell you niggas thinking
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when Im riding cause Im balling
Im calling out shots like a pool shark
My tool sparks in the dark when I fool marks
Yall fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But Imma get that ass hauled off fuck around with the clique
Theyll be looking for your dick with a stick nigga yall soft
So yall lost Imma ball out at all costs spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang til she falls off and sucks balls off I got the
Im not boucing little shorty Im relaxing right now
Id probably still be trapping if I wasnt rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house well whos strapped right now
Keep on talking folk Ill lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now get smacked right now
Im a buck mothafucka I dont know how to back down
Clown down here fakin frontin talking bout what you making nothin
Im 21 and 10 years deep that shit to me aint nothing
Im raised by the niggas getting head from the jays
Lose your leg when I spray end up dead from the K
Stay ready for the raid paid heavy from the yay
I told my class kiss my ass I make 11 everyday
