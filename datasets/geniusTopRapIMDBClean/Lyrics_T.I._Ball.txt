Ball Lyrics
Okay we walk off in this bitch, ballin’ in this bitch
Hoppin’ out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin’ bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they can't do a lot of this
Ayy, Rico told me turn the lights on (Turn the lights on!)
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
I’m a big dawg, got 'em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, ain’t none this raw
They like, "Ay look at T.I., ballin’ in the V.I
Bunch of bad bitches with him looking like Aaliyah"
We just pull up, hop out, go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard
This club so packed
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt
Ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball (This club so packed, these hoes so drunk)
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay it must be your ass cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks, girl
You make your way up to my section where it’s at, girl
Okay now do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket?
Broke niggas looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right ho, roll the dice ho
And you ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoes
For every day I spent behind the wall
I do it big, ride, fly, stunt, shine and ball
I got a bunch of money, so come and get it from me
And a bucket full of bottles, bust it open
If you wanna get drunk (Turn the lights on!)

This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt
Ball, ball, ball, ball (Yeah Tip)
Ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball (This club so packed, these hoes so drunk)
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt
Ball!

Ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Pop that pussy like a gun, pull the trigger
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator
Bitch, shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody
I’m killin’ these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy
I’m a good looking rapper, I ain’t tryna stunt
I'ma fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at, ho? Where you at, ho?
Can a nigga stick his key up in ya back door? (Turn the lights on!)
Tunechi

This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt
Ball!

And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie (Free Boosie)
Now back that thang up for me, show me that you love me
If it’s really too much for you, you can bring a couple buddies
Every day I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacaine
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat ass, pretty toes and thangs
Long hair, don't care, long as none down there
If it's manicured, I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club, throw some money in the air
(Turn the lights on!) This club so packed
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk (Haha)
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk (Yeah)
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk (Yea yea)
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt
Young Mula baby!
Ball, ball, ball, ball (Woo!)
Ball, ball, ball, ball (Uh)
Ball, ball, ball, ball (This club so packed, these hoes so drunk)
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt
Ball!17Embed
