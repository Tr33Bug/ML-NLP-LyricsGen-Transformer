Hey hey what you waitin for

Do it to the maximum take it while you askin them
Dont listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational
See I said I was King and them lames started laughin them
Same suckers now want the King on a track with em
I composed several classicals you know like Top Back
Dope Boyz Bring Em Out
And What You Know About That
Now they ask how I top What You Know About That
Dominated 06 now Im goin right back
See me reign hell I just showed you like that
Even Denzel say Damn I aint know it like that
Nigga yeah still Bankhead you can tell
Aint nothin changed but the name on the mail
I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihanas see me slang in the chair
I will slang caine no such thing as a jail
Say you need a hundred squares It just came off the scale


Lets do it you better do it you better do it
Hey what you waitin for
Do it cause Ima do it cause Ima do it
Hey what you waitin for
Do it you know we do it you know we do it
Hey what you waitin for
Do it you better do it you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin and lil shit stoppin
Big shit poppin and lil shit stoppin
Big shit poppin and lil shit stoppin
Ball on these niggas bein broke is not an option
Now do it
Do it like a ball player where you see me ball at
Stacks tall as ball players from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami Cincinnati or the Riverdale
Arizona California make it rain anywhere
Pullin out that pistol nigga who you think you finna scare
These 20 rounds of missiles have ya pissin in your underwear
I tote a pair of 40 cals so you better tone it down
Or I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it goin down
ATown West Side club crucial catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry Dro and Mack be
Jackers lie say they caught me slippin how could that be
Im somethin like a stalker I be erywhere the strap be
The trap be jumpin with them hundred dollar slabs
If I want it nigga I could get a hundred on the tab
Sell em all double down nigga do the math
Think I wont pull up in somethin with 200 on the dash
I do it you better do it you better do it
Hey what you waitin for
Do it cause Ima do it cause Ima do it
Hey what you waitin for
Do it you know we do it you know we do it
Hey what you waitin for
Do it you better do it you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin and lil shit stoppin
Big shit poppin and lil shit stoppin
Big shit poppin and lil shit stoppin
Ball on these niggas bein broke is not an option
Now do it
Now I do it like I wanna do it and do that shit in front of you
Real nigga vision pimpin I aint seein none of you
I do it for my nigga Phil daughter and his mama too
I do it for my oldest sons and their grandmama too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest sons mama who
Go buy what she want because she know it aint a problem to
You do somethin to them and to you Ill bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partners go make sure them niggas stuntin too
We do it with them choppers
Aint no problem where you runnin to
We do it for the block thats why aint nobody stoppin me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too they watchin me
I did it nonstop now see how these niggas copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be
Who do it this good and do it this fresh
No matter what I do you know I do it to death
Eyy Imma do it you better do it you better do it
Hey what you waitin for
