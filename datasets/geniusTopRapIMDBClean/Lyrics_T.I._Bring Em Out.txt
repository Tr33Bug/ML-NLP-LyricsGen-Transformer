Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The King back now hoes dont even know how to act now
Hit the club strippers getting naked fore I sat down
Still balling money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the Lac down

If I hit you in the face you gon be suing and shit
And if I catch another case I know Ill truly be missed so Ima
Keep a cool head stay out of the news
And show these other rappers its bedtime  Bedtime 
Its clear to see that Im ahead of my time
