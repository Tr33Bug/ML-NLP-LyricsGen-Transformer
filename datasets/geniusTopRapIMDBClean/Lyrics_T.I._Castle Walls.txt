Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made better look again
I got a butler got a maid and a mansion
The belief is that Im living out a millionaires fantasy
With phantoms and ferraris in the driveway
But you see the fames in exchange for the same mans sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently its damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages his family
Encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while I dare you would it scare you
While it surely seem like Kings life aint glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesnt see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls
Honestly to me I think Id lose every benefit of all that Ive accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess Im saying that to say that opportunity
But they just dont equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah aint paid and Nique Nique aint straight
Would your favourite song about the whips money and shit
Be relevant if you found out Domani wasnt rich nope
So me being the GOAT shouldnt mean more to me
Than seeing to it King go
From a badass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may as well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip
Shawty Lo Gucci or Ludacris
Or if Im fucking with a ho
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally Im dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I dont get the chance to kiss the hand
That slap me in the face ay Im just a man
If they saying I aint the best at making hit records
Its cause this my life these aint just rapping
Shit you think of that deep did you dawg
See you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch aint thinking with the deep did you dawg
Cause see you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls
Nobody knows Im all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom but I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world its beautiful
But theres no place to fall
For the record ay I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected Im faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
But the day that I walk away I aint saying that Im amazing
Downplaying the way I kept fellas from catching cases
Wont take into consideration how much it mean what Im saying
And when I say what I mean even when Im surrounded by the fakest
From one of the greatest sinners blessed with most of Gods graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty Im always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty obvious youve been ignoring me
Who else you seen make it through the storm unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for Prince Charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of yall dont see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls
