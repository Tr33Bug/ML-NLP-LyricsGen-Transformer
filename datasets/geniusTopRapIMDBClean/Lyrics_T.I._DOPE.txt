DOPE Lyrics

Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
I feel like I’m on dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
Boy you really get me high
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
There now really close
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Ok)
Boy you really get me high
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Yeah, yeah) I feel like I’m on dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Uh, alright) Boy you really get me high
(Aye, aye, yeah)
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
There now hold me close
Anonymous bending corners with burners on us
Come and ride with me
Birkin duffle a hundred thousand in it
Aye, nigga, roll up
Anyway, D'Usse mixed with lemonade
Feeling good like I'm dealing ye
Moving ten a day
Time limit never
Could do this shit forever
Can't even put it in words, how I am in love with her
From slinging work on the curb, hustling drugs with her
The jet ride 50 million, a wonderful feeling
Shit, I'm high as a motherfucker
Don't ask me shit, make me lie to you motherfucker
Man truth is for real, feel like Dre and Pharrell
Mixed with Eric B. and Rakim, shawty hell on the scale
And still the game enticing me, like every time I see her
They like to pop a seal, high enough to see Aaliyah
For real, and man, I know how to chill
You don't know how good it make a nigga feel

I'm coming down
I'm high as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy really you get me high
I'm high as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
And I need you close
Get me closer, it's closer
Boy you really get me high
I feel like I’m on dope
You might also like
This winter shit got me high as a bitch
Dripping sauce kicking flavor, super fly with the shit
Don't need a gram to get laid, an ounce to get paid
G Kush to roll up, a drink to pour up
Anyone know us, they know trap shit in our DNA
Numbers on a need-to-know basis, this ain't no Q&A
I promised Dre that I would put the game on lock
And ain't no taking that shit back, put it on everything I got
God damn
Aventador, hopping out a Lamb
In residential areas flyin', I'm getting outta 'Dam
Ma'am tell your son he better watch it, cause we roll
And disrespect is not an option in my neighborhood
So watch how you talking to me
Even if we know you hating, then that is all it can be
Cause if call in all the niggas indebted to me
Find you ass OD'd
Dead ass can be

I'm coming down
(There now hold me close)
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy you really get me high
I'm high as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
And I need you close
Get me closer, it's closer
Boy you really get me high
I feel like I’m on dope
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy you really get me high
I'm high as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
And I need you close
Get me closer, it's closer
Boy you really get me high
I feel like I’m on dope

Ok, compliment my watch and call it that old thing
Blowing gasoline to put my hat on lean
Where I stay all they say is “Fuck Trump”, all day
Two or three pistolero with me eh hombre
She brought an ‘O of kush to me and a six pack
Okay, well, I’m about to roll it up and hit that
Now I’mma make her wipe me down like a wet sink
Ride it like a jet ski, pass it to the next bitch
Aye

I'm coming down
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy really you get me high
I'm high as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
And I need you close
Get me closer, it's closer
Boy you really get me high
I feel like I’m on dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope

I'm telling you, man
If you can get the high I'm on
I mean winnin' got me blowed, man
I swear...haha!
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
Dre! Where you get this shit, man?
Yeah, from the westside only, man
C'mon Tip!
You know, I swear to God man
I ain't known a bad day in so long
You know, thank God haha
Aye man, life ain't, life ain't like this for you, man?
