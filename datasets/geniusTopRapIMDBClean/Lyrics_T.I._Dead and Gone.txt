Ayy let me kick it to you right quick man
Not on some gangsta shit man on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
Im sure you feel the same way
Big Phil this for you pimpin
Oh Ive been travelin on this road too long  Too long 
Just tryin to find my way back home  Back home 
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone
And oh Ive been travelin on this road too long  Too long 
Just tryin to find my way back home  Back home 
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone hey
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin they hate on
You walk by they get wrong
You reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just you against them pick one then rush him
Figure you get jumped hell thats nothin
They dont wanna stop there now they bustin
Now you gushin ambulance rushin you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times bullet hit yo spine
Paralyzed waistdown now youre wheelchairbound
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin with three guys
Now your pride in the way but your pride is the way
You could fuck around get shot die any day
Niggas die everyday all over bullshit
Dope money dice game ordinary hood shit
Could this be cause of hip hop music
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually niggas dont know what to do when
Their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blow I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects
No more stress now Im straight
Now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets Im blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away
Oh Ive been travelin on this road too long  Too long 
Just tryin to find my way back home  Back home 
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone
And oh Ive been travelin on this road too long  Too long 
Just tryin to find my way back home  Back home 
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone hey
I aint never been scared I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that shit didnt even have to happen
But you dont think about it when you out there trappin
In apartments hangin smokin and rappin
Niggas start shit next thing you know we cappin
Get locked up then didnt even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that shit look back just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin out that door
Whoda thought Id never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I dont want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw cost me more
Ida took that asswhoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
Cause I hit you and you sue me
I shoot you get locked up who Me
No more stress now Im straight
Now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets Im blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away
Oh Ive been travelin on this road too long  Too long

I turn my head to the East
I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright cause
Oh Ive been travelin on this road too long  Too long 
Just tryin to find my way back home  Back home 
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone
And oh Ive been travelin on this road too long  Too long 
Just tryin to find my way back home  Back home
