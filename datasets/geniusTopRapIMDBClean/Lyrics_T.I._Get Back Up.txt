But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgement  Oh no no 
Fly as Im is shawty Imma rise above this  Oh no no no no 
Hey what it is world Yeah its me again
Back before you at your mercy on bended knee again
No running from the truth as much as we pretend
That it aint what it is then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends  Im sorry 
For letting you down I wont take you down this road again  Uhuh 
Most of you now saying Whatever here we go again  What 
Blogs radio and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment  I gotta say 
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious  Ha ha 
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou
Point your finger now with me looking down  Down 
Same clown that was Twitpicing at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting wait a second
Never mind my imperfections this a fact remember that
No mistakes too great to recover and bounce back

I admit yeah I done some dumb shit disappointed errybody I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess that time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes its hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The Bible say Let he without sin cast the stone first  Stone first 
The sinner or the one who judged him who was wrong first
Yeah he go to work never done no drugs up until the Fed
He just drink his liquor touch his kids beat his wife instead  Damn 
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ the AJC and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacobs ladder
My good outweigh the bad God aint that what really matter  Nope 
And matter fact Im wrong but after that
The good I done in yo hood should it overshadow that
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn fore its over with even if youre so legit
That you get a house with a dog and a picket fence  Ay ay ay 
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this  Ay ay 
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up  Im only human dog 
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up  Im just a human yall 
Push the dirt off your jersey then go for the cup  Ay ay 
Or the trophy or the ring champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt and the ring
