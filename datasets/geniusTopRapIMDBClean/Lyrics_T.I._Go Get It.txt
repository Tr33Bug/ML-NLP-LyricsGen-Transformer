I gotta grind wont stop hustle wont quit
Shine like no other I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch
If I want it bet I got it
If I dont then all I gotta do is
Go get it stay about my business
Ball till I fall floss until Im finished
I just go get it stay about my business
Im living just to kill it stacking millions to the ceiling
Every day above ground all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger bitch Im stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and theyre stupid dumb thick
Im the marathon man all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict superficial still official
Multimillion dollar shit money is the object
