I gotta grind wont stop hustle wont quit
Shine like no other I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch
If I want it bet I got it
If I dont then all I gotta do is
Go get it stay about my business
Ball till I fall floss until Im finished
I just go get it stay about my business
Im living just to kill it stacking millions to the ceiling
Every day above ground all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger bitch Im stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and theyre stupid dumb thick
Im the marathon man all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict superficial still official
Multimillion dollar shit money is the object
Hot shit bitch I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure with no diamond Richard Mille and Vacheron
They just talk about they got it

Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew the whole team high

Bruh you know me you know who I be
Stacking that dough thats all I see

I gotta grind wont stop hustle wont quit
Shine like no other I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch
If I want it bet I got it
If I dont then all I gotta do is
Go get It  stay about my business
Ball til I fall floss until Im finished
I just go Get It  Stay about my business
Im living just to kill it stacking millions to the ceiling


I live life fuck late night

Dont sniff yay but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that fofo

Bad white bitch super thick

Her ass fat face soso no paper trail
No phone call no emails no photos
Just backshot with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slowmo
A Purple label Polo and Akoo thats all I do
Man I Striver Row my denim in my new Margiela shoes
Man we be cool if we just parle on Margharita Molly
And the strongest pack around bumpin Sade out in Maui
We menagin for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it

Chicks just cant resist this pimping
Get the million bout my business
Bruh you know me you know who I be
Stacking that dough thats all I see

I gotta grind wont stop hustle wont quit
Shine like no other I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch
If I want it bet I got it
If I dont then all I gotta do is
Go get it stay about my business
Ball till I fall floss until Im finished
I just go get it stay about my business
Im living just to kill it stacking millions to the ceiling
