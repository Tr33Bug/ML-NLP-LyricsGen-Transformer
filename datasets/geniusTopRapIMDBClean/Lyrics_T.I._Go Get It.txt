Go Get It Lyrics
I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my business
Ball till I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, get it, stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling
Every day above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers, Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they're stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multi-million dollar shit, money is the object
Hot shit, bitch, I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure with no diamond, Richard Mille and Vacheron
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch, I‘m 'bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream 'bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by

Bruh you know me, you know who I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I G-O G-E-T I-T

I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get It - stay about my business
Ball til I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, Get It - Stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

I live life, fuck late night
Get shitfaced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s on switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro'
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that fo'-fo'
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, them other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
A Purple label, Polo and Akoo, that’s all I do
Man I Striver Row my denim in my new Margiela shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle, on Margharita Molly
And the strongest pack around bumpin' Sade out in Maui
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Chicks just can’t resist this pimping
Get the million 'bout my business
Bruh you know me, you know who I be
Stacking that dough that’s all I see
I G-O G-E-T I-T

I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my business
Ball till I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, get it, stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling26Embed
