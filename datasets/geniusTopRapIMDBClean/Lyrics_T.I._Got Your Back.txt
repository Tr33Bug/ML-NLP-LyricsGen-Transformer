Got Your Back Lyrics
Hey, shorty I know you be hearin this and that from here and there but
Please trust and believe that I'm
I see you gonna ride for me, so I'm a die for you
Is you with me? (I got your back boy)
Well let's get it

When you're high (for when it's all good), when you're low (to when it's all bad)
Well I promise I will never let you go (now what you call that?)
Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (I know you got my back, right?)
Keep my swagger, keep it lookin good for ya (yeah)
Keep it lookin hood for ya (yeah)
Shorty if you don't know (yeah, yeah, yeah, say)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Fuck the world long as you got my back, right?)
Hey it's whatever shorty, you ain't gotta ask
Yes, Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check
You can get it, you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louis purses
My mission's to purchase Earth for her, present the gift without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose, pleasure to be at your service
We front row at fashion shows, as well as Sunday morning service
For better days or for worse, if I'm paid or I'm hurtin
In my pocket, she still got a nigga back, know that's for sure
No matter what may occur in life, everyday with her is like, a plus
I'm a love her 'til she be like "that's enough"
Pop a bottle, get a couple wine glasses, fill 'em up and lift 'em up
Let us toast to the future, here's to us
No, here's to her

They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches, me and you
Stuck to your side li-li-like glue
Be by your side whatever you goin' through

When you're high (for when it's all good), when you're low (to when it's all bad)
Well I promise I will never let you go (now what you call that?)
Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (I know you got my back, right?)
Keep my swagger, keep it lookin good for ya (yeah)
Keep it lookin hood for ya (yeah)
Shorty if you don't know (yeah, yeah, yeah, say)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Fuck the world long as you got my back, right?)

Hey, this is for the women who, man caught a sentence
Who gon' be there for a minute but they didn't keep they distance
They stayed home, waitin on the phone and on visit day
Show up looking good, smelling better, playin kissy face (yeah, yeah)
Just wanna let you that we appreciate (and I appreciate you, baby)
Everything you do for us on a day to day 
And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
No bouquet of flowers
Could ever show how much we know we need you
We do, all that's in our power just to please you
See boo, fuck them girls, I would leave the World 'fore I leave you
May God say "even Eve and Adam ain't got shit on these two"

They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches, me and you
Stuck to your side li-li-like glue
Be by your side whatever you goin' through

When you're high (for when it's all good), when you're low (to when it's all bad)
Well I promise I will never let you go (now what you call that?)
Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)

Sure enough, even though them chicks be hatin on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side, through whatever situation we gon' ride
Make all my fantasies come alive, that's no lie now
I'll be, alright just as long as you beside me
Ten million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon' be in there with me at night
The pieces to the puzzles in my life
Through all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man and you know you got my back
Worth every car, every bag, with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home, I ain't gon' never leave that
Them bitches best believe that

When you're high (for when it's all good), when you're low (to when it's all bad)
Well I promise I will never let you go (now what you call that?)
Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (I know you got my back, right?)
Keep my swagger, keep it lookin good for ya (yeah)
Keep it lookin hood for ya (yeah)
Shorty if you don't know (yeah, yeah, yeah, say)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Fuck the world long as you got my back, right?)3Embed
