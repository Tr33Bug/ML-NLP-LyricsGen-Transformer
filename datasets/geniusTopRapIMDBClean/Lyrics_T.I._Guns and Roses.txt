Hey have you ever loved somebody so much you cant stand it but cant do without em
Do anything for em cause you truly do adore em
Like dedicate songs write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore em
But you feel like they feel like you aint right for em
Therefore your hearts torn
Between bein with em forever leavin em never
But it seem like you arguin fightin over whatever
Maybe we can leave find someone better
Even though you know youve never known none better
My heart say nah she cant leave wont let her
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I aint been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she wont shut up
Love her to death dont know whether to kiss her or kill her
Shouldve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And wed pray but
Even love couldnt save us
Wed wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we dont know which one to choose
When either way were gonna lose
Still wed pray but
Even love couldnt save us
Wed wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
I guess Id rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy a lot of Prada Gucci and Balenciaga
To keep her content and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn arounds a conflict
Mostly dumb shit like who she run with
Where the fuck you been Your pants  they dont fit
Really honestly speaking some things I dont get
No matter how much she try she cant make it make more sense
Therefore here we go again
Screamin yellin at the top of our lungs she goin in
Saying the kind of shit I be like if you was a man
I would go in your shit for real no shit
But I love her so much that I cant forget
That the feel of a kiss it could heal when Im sick
Still I dont like to feel like this
If I didnt miss her I would try to get her killed right quick
Shouldve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And wed pray but
Even love couldnt save us
Wed wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we dont know which one to choose
When either way were gonna lose
Still wed pray but
Even love couldnt save us
Wed wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I dont really ever know why
If I could live without you Id try
Shouldve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And wed pray but
Even love couldnt save us
Wed wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we dont know which one to choose
When either way were gonna lose
Still wed pray but
Even love couldnt save us
Wed wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
