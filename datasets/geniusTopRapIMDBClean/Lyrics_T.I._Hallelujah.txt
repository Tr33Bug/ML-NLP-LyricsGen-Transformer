Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Sometimes I wake up feel like Im in Forest City Arkansas
Although Im free Im still a prisoner of all I saw
Sometimes I leave this booth at 4 am and ride down Simpson
Just prayin homie and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real feel like Im still in prison
I reach out for Tameeka hand Im trippin cause she missin
Its pitch black dark like Im in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream Lord please prepare me
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former friends talk about me like Im dead and buried
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
Trouble in my soul the devil got a hold
Did everything to me but kill me like he did to Job
He took my diamonds took my rhymes took my fame and gold
He took my business interest he took my wife and kids
But he cant take nothing God cant give me back again
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
I went to jail stood tall then I fell again
It seems like Im Jonah and right back in that whale again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate control my breath again
Like Lazarus Ive risen from a bed of death again
The Lord is with me I could stand against a thousand men
I read the songs of David prayed to be like Solomon
Gods wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men
Im a king I dare to lead when they just follow men
I see a better way Im keeping my eyes on the sparrow
Im exiting my Egypt tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me before she left this earth that I was special
And because Im special they gon make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas but he arose on the third day
To save youre here to give favor let the church say
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Yes He loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
