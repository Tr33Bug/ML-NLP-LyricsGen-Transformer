Hallelujah Lyrics
Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so

Sometimes I wake up, feel like I’m in Forest City, Arkansas
Although I’m free, I’m still a prisoner of all I saw
Sometimes I leave this booth at 4 am, and ride down Simpson
Just prayin homie, and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I’m still in prison
I reach out for Tameeka hand, I’m trippin 'cause she missin'
It’s pitch black dark, like I’m in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream, Lord, please prepare me
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former friends talk about me like I'm dead and buried
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
Trouble in my soul, the devil got a hold
Did everything to me but kill me, like he did to Job
He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold
He took my business interest, he took my wife and kids
But he can’t take nothing God can’t give me back again
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again
It seems like I'm Jonah and right back in that whale again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again
Like Lazarus I’ve risen from a bed of death again
The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men
I read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon
God’s wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men
I’m a king, I dare to lead when they just follow men
I see a better way, I’m keeping my eyes on the sparrow
I’m exiting my Egypt, tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me before she left this earth that I was special
And because I’m special, they gon' make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas, but he arose on the third day
To save, you're here to give favor, let the church say

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
