Here we go
Just keep going and dont look back
And look forward from where youre at
Theres some jealousy in your rearview
Wave hello hello hello
Push that pedal to the max
Count that money thats in your lap
Theres some jealousy in your rearview
Hello hello hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Wave hello hello hello
Mashing in the fast lane envy in my rearview
Mils in my windshield keep em in a clear view
Cheers to my partners who got it we finally did it
And heres to the ones with potential to go and get it
We survived yesterday foreign ride connoisseurs
Popping fly today tomorrow aint promised to us
Grind hard for dirty money but our hearts pure
Steady mobbing on these suckers man theyre so funny to us
Broke niggas all smiles when they run into us
Get by theyself they talking tough but dont do nothing to us
Call themselves paper chasing when wealth be running to us
You violate the Puppet Master get your string pulled
Hustle Gang King Team label me the ring leader
Just showing haters the tail lights of my twoseaters
Two heaters with me in the ride but I dont need em though
Left evil behind me thats where I plan to keep it go
Just keep going and dont look back
And look forward from where youre at
Theres some jealousy in your rearview
Wave hello hello hello
Push that pedal to the max
Count that money thats in your lap
Theres some jealousy in your rearview
Hello hello hello
Hello

Hello
Wave hello hello hello


I hustle hard forever shine pay haters no never mind
Wont stop until we popping bottles at the finish line
Never been the quitting kind spirit aint no killing mine
Im getting mine you dont like it nigga get in line
So many times Ive shown dudes I wont lose
Times precious but waste yours if you want to
Hey I made it and you didnt for that I aint to blame
Wont change a thing the circumstancell remain the same
Cant complain Im highly favored my flavors god given
So used to hate appreciation is a odd feeling
Still I stay focused on the millions trying to dodge prison
Praying asking for forgiveness hoping God listen
As far as dissing me pimping go ahead and have a ball
Meanwhile Im getting bread determined to have it all
Im talking money sonny if aint none of that involved
Why is we conversing This vehicle aint reversing go
Just keep going and dont look back
And look forward from where youre at
Theres some jealousy in your rearview
Wave hello hello hello
Push that pedal to the max
Count that money thats in your lap
Theres some jealousy in your rearview
Hello hello hello
