I never let you down Ima shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines alright
Hard Im gonna ball on them squares I float
Quartermillion dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doing they dont do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town Im at
In a flash like that recognize Im back
Strike a match catch a fire
Any moment I decide thats enough of all your lies
Boy your buzz just died
Step inside superfly to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grow with every new crew
Cause these guys they dont ride like my nigga you too
Tight jeans funny haircuts dancing on the screen
Theres a drought of real niggas in the game so it seems
Just pretend to holla pimping give the shit a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head Im like why
Be yourself you aint got a pimp bone in your body
I can tell you aint never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne Gucci Mane
Me and Boosie all go to prison
Now he flipping hoes every nigga tripping
Listen dude for you that aint in the cards
Thank the powers in the guns
But overall its in your heart
Nowadays I dont know whats up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it And I promised I would put you on point
Im disappointed in you dogg you aint hold it down at all
But I aint going at your jaw just going to show you how to ball
Standing tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorms
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for them
I never let you down Ima shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines alright
Hard Im gonna ball on them squares I float
Quartermillion dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doing they dont do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town Im at
In a flash like that recognize Im back
Strike a match catch a fire see TI add gas
Whats a Molotov cocktail that never break a glass
Still I am partnas want to come for me you better bring it
I aint mad I forgive them God I know they aint mean it
Yeah I seen it all before hate Im popping and they aint
Wrack they brain try to think how to stop it and they cant
Aint that lame but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
Im no longer being callous Im gonna let you niggas have it
Wont be satisfied until somebody dies and Im patiently waiting on
Me and the reaper on a first name basis now
Im a let you make it now stay totally out the way for you
But know that we could take it any place you wanna take it too
Hating in your blood Cuz Yes its just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice clearly I aint hearing your voice
Keep it up an Imma send you ass to chill wit Aunt Joyce
Hey you can have the bottom partner Im up in the sky box
I got shit locked down nigga why stop now
Im so above you hover over suckers why drop down
Im so profound it goes down and I never let you down


I never let you down Ima shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines alright
Hard Im gonna ball on them squares I float
Quartermillion dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doing they dont do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town Im at
In a flash like that recognize Im back
