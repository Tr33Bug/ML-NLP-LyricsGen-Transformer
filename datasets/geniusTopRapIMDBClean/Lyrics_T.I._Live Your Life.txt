Hey never mind what haters say ignore em til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
Youd still be wastin days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater still I love em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay you know they couldnt get work on Labor Day
It aint that black and white it has an area the shade of gray
Im Westside anyway even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made em spray now I could make em put the Ks away
Been thuggin all my life cant say I dont deserve to take a break
Youd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away


Youre gonna be a shinin star
In fancy clothes and fancy carars
And then youll see youre gonna go far
Cause everyone knows just who ya areare
So live your life  AYY Ayyy ayyy ayyy 
You steady chasin that paper
Just live your life  OHH Ayyy ayyy ayyy 
Aint got no time for no haters
Just live your life  AYY Ayyy ayyy ayyy 
No tellin where itll take ya
Just live your life  OHH Ayyy ayyy ayyy

My life  AYY  my life  OHH 
Just livin my life  AYY  my life  OHH 
My life  AYY  my life  OHH  just livin my life
Im the opposite of moderate immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit impartial to the politics
Articulate but still Ill grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that dont work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game but ay Im not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin and the hollerin back and forth with the arguin
Where you from who you know what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositin
Them checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray prioritizin horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause youre piss poor morally
Ignorin all prior advice and forewarnin
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden arent we
Youre gonna be a shinin star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then youll see youre gonna go far
Cause everyone knows just who ya areare
So live your life  AYY Ayyy ayyy ayyy 
You steady chasin that paper
Just live your life  OHH Ayyy ayyy ayyy 
Aint got no time for no haters
Just live your life  AYY Ayyy ayyy ayyy 
No tellin where itll take ya
Just live your life  OHH Ayyy ayyy ayyy 
Cause Im a paper chaser
Just livin my life  AYY  my life  OHH 
My life  AYY  my life  OHH 
Just livin my life  AYY  my life  OHH 
My life  AYY  my life  OHH  just livin my life
Got everybody watchin what I do come walk in my shoes
And see the way Im livin if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And Im not goin awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin your paper and keep on climbin
Look in the mirror and keep on shinin  shinin 
Until the game ends til the clock stop
We gon post up on the top spot
Livin the life the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life my life
I do it how I wanna do
Im livin my life my life
I will never lose
Im livin my life my life
And Ill never stop it
Miya hee miya ho miya hu miya haha
Miya hee miya ho miya hu miya haha
Miya hee miya ho miya hu miya haha
Miya hee miya ho miya hu miya haha
So live your life
