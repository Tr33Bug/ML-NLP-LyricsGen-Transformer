Whats happenin man This TIP you know
Id like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave to the streets to the jail cell
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three you know what Im sayin
I feel the only thing I aint done yet is die you know
But it aint how I live while Im here its how I live when I leave ya dig
Lifes ups and downs they come and go 
But when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint alive I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
Its true what goes around comes back you know 
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint survive may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky
My cousin Toot aint have to die right in front of his son
And his wife he lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done thats my muhfuckin folk
And I love that nigga to death no muhfuckin joke
I can feel my eyes fillin the Lord is my witness
If I catch him Ima kill him I made it my business
Back in the day you stayed in my business
Taught me I aint have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally thats why today you not with me
My cousin died over some yay and I miss him
Plus he at his family house lets say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin judge gave a life sentence
I heard that now Im dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments he still aint brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life it taught me that
Lifes ups and downs they come and go 
But when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint alive I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
Its true what goes around comes back you know 
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint survive may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky
You ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep til day 2
Well thats how sick I was when JayRu
Found out the hard way that wasnt powder that they were tootin
Overdosed on heron died at 22
If you aint heard about your daughter she smile just like you
So cute even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose but ha what can you do
And I got four myself yuh its been a few
Now everything I do is for King Messiah Deyjah Domani
Tell the Lord they all Ive got so please dont take them from me
From me standin in the trap with carryin this here cap
Laughin at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas man yall trippin with no maps
Get robbed and ask to borrow my pistol aint gon happ
Me you the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize you died thats why they say that
Lifes ups and downs they come and go 
But when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint alive I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
Its true what goes around comes back you know 
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint survive may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky
I bet you niggas think Im livin it up
Til you see polices laughin as they pickin me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot is you kiddin or what
Fuck how many millions I got nigga so what if Im hot
When I got prices on my head Feds rushin my spot
A million haters want me dead forced to carry a gat
But yous a seventime felon what you doin with that
Its a Catch22 either you lose or you lose
Thats the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I aint never been a buster always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
Im a G prepared to die for whats important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit me
Put up the house and bet the odds if its comin from me
OGs say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin
I try to keep it to myself but sometimes I couldnt take it
Got four kids the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked
Lifes ups and downs they come and go 
But when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint alive I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
Its true what goes around comes back you know 
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who aint survive may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky
