Hey I know shit get kinda fucked up some times you know
I know you can get carried away with yourself
But uh why dont you be real with me
And be real with you at the same time
You cant get what you get here nowhere else ma
Keep it real now
You know you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know
Cavalli dress and high heels
And drop tops on hot wheels
We live how we wanna live cos we got mills
Them other niggas barely buy a hot meal
In VIP dem bottle popping do it BIG
Come get with TIP and be balling til you DIE
Invisible set bracelets see clearly
Take away your stress mean that sincerely
Problem solveem never mind that
Girlfriends see your bag be like where you find that
Plus what the fucks a prenup You aint gotta sign that
You nut up take half Ima make it right back
Im a motherfucking hustler to the heart whats the
Sense in leaving me and be back fucking with them busters
Bentley for your birthday Goyard purse day
Filled with them stacks you know you gotta love that
Man of respect on a big jet
With a big dick and a big check
I pop big shit Im good as it gets
You leave me where else you think you can get this
Girl you can get another guy to beat that pussy for you
Them niggas cowards though and Id take a bullet for you
Mansions jewelry all I needs for you and me to
Have some understanding have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations I take in considerations
Im rough around the edges dont bow with me and be patient
And you sadly mistaken if you think Im into chasing
My heart is RSVP Ive extended an invitation
And dont go wasting your time with what they saying online
Your positions divine dont believe Look around
I got a strong mind and a kind heart
With a soft kiss but I love hard


Dont you love this life like I love you
Anything you could ask do it for you
Drop Jags Birkin bags Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami Hollywood hills
Vacationin in Monaco Ibiza
On the French Riviera with our feet up
A lifestyle so rare
You know you aint going nowhere
