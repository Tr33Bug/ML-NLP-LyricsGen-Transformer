Ayy in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when its a few of us
She let me fingerfuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us we wanted one thang
Just penetratin that throat dawg
She choked on it like smoke dawg
But whenever I fucked up my reup
In a dice game I go see her
Shell give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a 69
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
Why you always give your ass up
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laidthis shit dont add up
She said Tip all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it aint real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back I still fuck
And thats fucked up but she so trill
I need somethin she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga guess where we go chill
For bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds til it go down
I remember shawty she stayed down
I wont say her name cause she married now
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
She would always turn heads when shed fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And wed both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin just to see if the police comin
We got close over time her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was bout 17
I aint even have a license couldnt even drive
I was goin back and forth with each flight
Another show after show each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
Shed go through my phone and wed fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasnt really much more that we could do
Wasnt really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh one night I had a few
Yeah this little chick that caught my eye
I told her Hurry up meet me at the room
And no I didnt have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said Im pregnant
And you can almost bet she kept it
And thats the reason why you left me
On top of all that it wasnt even mine
I went and got paternity testeddamn
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
Wait hol up is that you
With them big ol thighs after school
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said Im in hot pursuit
You said I wont ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin for the nigga with the tallest fetti
You overlookin every nigga that aint quite ready
To make it rain on you like Im about to break a levee
Hol up that pussy petty
Yeah your nails did your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine ho
Tried to make some time ho
But I aint got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line ho
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggasfuck you and Mick Romney
Im grown now Im on my own now
Im pooooppin
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got ooooptions
Fast forward wait is that you
With them big ol thighs after school
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note thats overdue I know
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
