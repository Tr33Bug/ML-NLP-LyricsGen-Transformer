I know radio prolly aint gonna play this
But chopper goin off in the hood man
Like Afghanistan or the Gaza strip somewhere man yeah
We hear it so much we probably numb to it by now
After all its the American way right
Home of the brave and free  Its America 
Free just to murder me  Land of the handgun 
Land of the beautiful  Home of the shotgun 
Cursed by the hate we throw  Youre dead if you aint got one 
Is this the new national anthem  It was like this fore I got here baby I aint do it 
Is this the new national anthem  I aint start it Im just a part of it turn it 
You say this the home of the brave I guess
I say this the home of the Ks and the vets
All alone with the Js smokin yay cause he stressed
On chrome with a Tek taught to spray for respect
I learned from the best used to stay in the jects
Bought work from the vets burnin rubber in the Vettes
This as good as it gets used to play with the rats
Then I got older and learned stay away from the rats
God blessed this nigga to hustle up and make eight figures
Turned from a goon to a great young nigga
No complainin just doin what it take young nigga
I was raised in a decade of hate young nigga
Always dodgin polices because they hate young niggas
And we hate them too 38 in him shoe
All the changes the system will take him through
He aint a killer but he will if you make him do it
Homicide hell ride theyll put him on trial
Let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile
And he only nineteen he aint even had a child
As a child told his mama hell be gone for a while
And she cried still they just put him inside
Now she all on her own cause her other son died
Listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
He a snake in a suit tryin to hide in disguise
Home of the brave and free  Well damn officer what I do 
Free just to murder me  Naw hold up man dont shoot I live over there 
Land of the beautiful  Hey hey man what you doin man 
Cursed by the hate we throw  You trippin dawg 
Is this the new national anthem  How many times has that ever happened to you What the fuck do you know about bein a black man in America 
Is this the new national anthem  And you wonder why we walk around with straps Fuck is you sayin 
For the stars and the stripes prison bars and the pipe
Young nigga rollin weed in a cigar he can light
Bang red either blue sellin hard and the white
Live by the gun never run from a fight
Trayvon in a hoodie walkin through the neighborhood
He didnt do shit to buddy he didnt have to die did he
I guess its cause his dad was a judge in the city
They didnt want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him
A jury of his peers said all was forgiven
But touch one of mine right or wrong Ima kill them
Fill them with the lead like they put in Martin Luther Kings head
Like they killed Malcolm X Edgar Hoover did that
You can catch me in the hood where they shootin niggas at
They dont know if Neighborhood or the Hoovers did that
Whether Piru or VLs or GDs wit me
We down to uprise from the OGs to peewees
Home of the brave and free  Dont get it fucked up 
Free just to murder me  If you aint found somethin youre willin to die for you aint fit to live 
Land of the beautiful  To get somethin youve never had you must be willin to do somethin youve never done 
Cursed by the hate we throw  Ima die by mine 
Is this the new national anthem  Hey America you have created a monster that refuses to be ignored the gig is up 
Is this the new national anthem  Yeah Im with the revolution I just aint into that stupid shit hell is you changin dawg What is you doin 
Let me ask you somethin
If the kids are the future tell me why you can get more for bein a CO than you can for bein a teacher
Tell me why it means more to the government to pay the people who got to watch over the prisoners
More than the people who got to keep the children from becomin prisoners
That make sense
Tell me why nine ounces of crack will get you more time than a rape right now
Tell me why them crazy white boys can tote a gun but I cant right now
Yeah I had felonies I done did dirt in the streets but I aint ever gave it to anybody that didnt deserve it
You know what I mean
I aint ever ran in no public place with no pistol shootin no innocent people I aint never ran in no school killin no kids
Man this is the result of you refusin to deal with the issues at hand
We are a product of the environment you placed us in
We aint do it we just lived through it
Home of the brave and free  And a message to my people 
Free just to murder me  Stop waitin on folk to help you help yourself it starts with you 
Land of the beautiful  Get yourself out reach back get somebody else out 
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem  And thats the way were goin to get ahead man sittin around waitin on government to do somethin for us aint never gonna happen partner they dont give a fuck about us 
Is this the new national anthem  But dont play into their hand partner you makin it easy for em hell is you doin
