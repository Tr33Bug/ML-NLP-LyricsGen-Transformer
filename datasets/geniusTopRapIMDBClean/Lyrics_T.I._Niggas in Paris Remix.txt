Niggas in Paris  Remix  Lyrics
Were going to skate to one song one song only
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
Aye man I dont know what been happening
I guess yall must have caught amnesia in my absence
I aint been gone that long have I
Well just for yall reminder
How about the crown meet the throne right here
Lets get it
Call me TI no CPR Im killing shit
Even in prison Im still the shit
Better recognize King in the building bitch
Act like you know you serious I  ball so hard 
My ankle hurt dont buy a car if I aint the first
In the country with a 1 2 3 bitch
You watch me while I painted her I  Ball so hard 
They hate to see me on the stage JayZ Kanye with me
You know I  ball so hard  TIP is scary
Merci beaucoup in Paris
Parlez vous francais I say Menage a trois today I say
I  ball so hard  hard out the park
Maybach chauffeured I aint got to park
So Ross so official dawg
Them lame cant do nothing with you dawg
She all on me better get your broad
Dont like that blow your whistle dawg I  ball so hard 
No referee throw no flag aint no techs for me
I keep them suckas upset with me
Them racks back on deck you best believe that I
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray that shit cray that shit cray  Cray Ye haa 
Bball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray that shit cray that shit cray

So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
Whats fifty grand to a mothafucker like me
Can you please remind me
Ball so hard  This shit crazy
Yall dont know that dont shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And Id look at you like this shit gravy
Ball so hard  This shit weird
We aint even posed to be here
Ball so hard  Since we here
Its only right that wed be fair
Psycho Im liable to go Michael take your pick
Jackson Tyson Jordan Game 6
Ball so hard  Got a broken clock
Rollies that dont ticktock
Audemars thats losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
Bball so hard  Im shocked too
Im supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what Ive escaped
Youd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Bball so hard  Lets get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles scold models
Spillin Ace on my sick Js
Ball so hard  Bitch behave
Just might let you meet Ye
ChiTowns D Rose
Im moving the Nets to BK
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray that shit cray that shit cray
Bball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray that shit cray that shit cray
She said Ye can we get married at the mall
I said Look you need to crawl fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard  That shit cray aint it Jay
Bball so hard  What she order fish fillet
Bball so hard  Your whip so cold  this old thing
Ball so hard  Act like youll ever be around mothafuckers like this again
Bougie girl grab my hand
Fuck that bitch she dont wanna dance
Excuse my French but Im in France ahah Im just sayin
Prince Williams aint do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
Whats Gucci my nigga Whats Louis my killer
Whats drugs my dealer Whats that jacket Margiela
Doctors say Im the illest cause Im suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas huh
I dont even know what that means
No one knows what it means but its provocative
No its not its gross

Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
Bball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
You are now watching the throne
Dont let me get in my zone

You know how many hot bitches I own 
Dont let me get in my zone
Dont let me get in my zone
Dont let me get in my zone
Dont let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building

How you know I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Dont let me into my zone
Dont let me into my zone
Im definitely in my zone zone zone zone zone
