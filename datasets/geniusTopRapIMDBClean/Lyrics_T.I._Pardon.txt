Well if I may speak freely we gon get a bag if we need it
Bust it down flip it repeat it
Suckas be greedy we was never playin in the game
If we was before we lost we cheated
Hold up they aint made a game you can play on me
I just be prayin for these niggas that they prey on me
They got another thing comin homie they gon see
I got the blessings of an angel every day on me
Okay church nigga used to ask me where Im from
Tell em Bankhead nigga but the earth my turf
Work wonder whats up under my shirt
Wonder why I aint gettin searched
Nigga TIP been solid speak against his name in the hood
And you will get slapped out bout it
Had straps out wildin but moments in the past
Just made me who I am thats why I dont run from it
Keep it one hunnid anyone who dont like it then fuck em
Get a little money then double level
Came a way from sellin weed in the envelope
To Puff Daddy standin with me in chinchilla
Road run Rubber Band Man
Made a hundred mil off of fifty grand man well goddamn

Shut up sucka nigga get up
Crazy in your head thinkin you can get us hit up
Foreign automotives all on my lawn
Yawn did this so long its gettin borin
Tapped into the culture made a motherfuckin lifestyle
Shoutout to my niggas doin trap music right now
And you know we aint with the hype million on the mic
Get to switchin out a queen just cause she aint what we like ay
Im a king done my thing from the green to the white
When you finished with opinions I got four or five classics
Say I aint the shit that nigga must be dippin acid
Fuck what all them other niggas doin all I know is keep goin
Start gettin money enjoyed it
Started sellin crack for employment
Make it out of Georgia that was a nigga only intent
Get them suckas out the way and get rich
Blockin my path boy the 40 cal start barkin
Like my nigga DMX in this bitch
Im a vet at this shit and all I ever been was authentic
Twenty years I been handlin my business
Get in my bag stackin my pennies
Buyin everything on the west side of the city
Cause thats where all the niggas dont play about TIP
So what I care bout what you got to say about TIP
Nigga beg your pardon
