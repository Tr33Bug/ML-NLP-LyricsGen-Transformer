Still big shit popping nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man cant go
Cant be he aint doing shit if he aint me
Cant you see the difference between us when I walking to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones start letting money go
