Poppin Bottles Lyrics
My section in the club, gimme Rosé
When you’re all ready say go, okay
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop
You see him standing on the furniture doing his thing
Tell the club owner: "fuck yo’ couch!" Rick James, bitch nigga
Pop a bottle, make that thing go bloaw
Let her drink it till she drown
Atta girl gon’ wild, pop a bottle
Bow, bow, bow…
Bring the 1738 Champagne the boss
Watch you getting money make it rain buy a bottle
Pop a cork, dork
If I may retort
I ball just as hard tomorrow as the day before
I pop bottles but I don't pour
Save the glass for guys who balling on a budget
Fuck it, let your glasses rise
I’m straight to the head with mine, why you acting surprised
Ask any ho who know me, all I do is smash and ride
Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes
Ain't no subtraction, only cash to divide
We getting money, bank roll, super-sized
Whether rain, sleet, sunny
Let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming

Pop a bottle, make that thing go bloaw
Let her drink it till she drown
Atta girl gon’ wild, pop a bottle

Yeah, okay, bring that shit to poppa
I heard you talk bout other niggas
Them niggas no matter
The tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka
Me and Weezy run this shit so bring me one soda and vodka
And a Fiji for my nigga cause the police probably watching
Man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option
We be sonning all these niggas, put their ass up for adoption
Man we start with straight shots, that get the bottle popping
We be working all night, telethon shit
Roll a super skinny one, Chanel Iman shit
Oooh, that's that fire, that have you calm shit
You with a lot of dudes, that’s that Elton John shit
Ahh, To each his own, I like a freak that's grown
I like a bad bitch from a decent home
Me and Tip, that's that pimping that we preaching on
And everybody trying to listen nigga, speakerphone

I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me
Cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me
Everything brand new, you get money like who?
Spent 150 on my car and my Audemars too
When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you
They see me like “there he go”
Look at you like ” ahh who?”
Bought every bottle at the bar
Shortie you know how I do
I take them all across your noggin', I ain't finna argue
Still big shit popping, nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can’t go
Can’t be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me
Can't you see the difference between us when I walking to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low
50 stack, I’m a show you how to ball: triple that7Embed
