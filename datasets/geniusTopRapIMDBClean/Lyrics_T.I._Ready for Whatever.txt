Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much  Uhyeah boy 
Lame niggas these niggas talk too much  Uhyeah 
Im ready for whatever somebody better tell em  Uhyeah boy 
I said Im ready for whatever hey hey  Yeah 
Even though my head in the clouds Im planted on the pavement
How Im walking round people staring at amazement
I play a lot of games on where I be and I aint playing with it
They so judgmental maybe they dont understand
If your life was in jeopardy eryday is you telling me
You wouldnt need weaponry just because of your felony
Consider this at least I got erybody sweating me
On the streets its people who wont rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago still in my sleep they threaten me
Paranoia stressing me aint nobody protecting me
Im dealing with the pressure from my partner dying next to me
Think cause no ones arrested they coming for me eventually
This was all the things I was going through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Not mentioning New Orleans niggas coming in the city
Killing all summer long aint nobody pay attention
Now is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jailthats a hell of a decision
But Im wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
Im just tryna let you know that I aint think I had a choice for real
I had straps in my ride  Ride  gotta go to prison  Prison 
You waiting on me to die you gon be waiting for a minute  Yeah 
Boy Im ready for whatever  Whatever  somebody better tell em  Tell em 
I be here when the smoke clears and everything settles for real
Cant afford the price of fame cause it cost too much  Too much 
Plus these sucker niggas lame and they talk too much
Yeah thats why Im ready for whatever somebody better tell em  Tell em 
I be here when the smoke clears and everything settles

I say When erything settles for real
Im a man I aint perfectI admit it Im guilty
But understand feel me  Yuh  I was riding filthy
Cause niggas out there plotting  Plotting  to rob me and kill me  Yuh 
Five hundred thousand every year spent on security  Hey 
My future was bright but now its gettin blurry
Cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely Godll deliver me up out it
Im a fighter to the heart I forever be about it
Im a father to my sons  Sons  asset to my community
Look all that I done My good outweigh the negativity
Ayy mentally I was focused on not letting history repeat itself
Thats why heat was kept in the vicinity
Yes officially I broke the law but not maliciously 
Through all of the publicity was anyone considering
My position and the logic hid in my decision  Ayy 
But they caught me with it now Im off to prison period  Bye 
But is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jailthats a hell of a decision
But Im wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
Im just tryna let you know that I aint think I had a choice for real
I had straps in my ride  Ride  gotta go to prison  Prison 
You waiting on me to die you gon be waiting for a minute  Yeah
