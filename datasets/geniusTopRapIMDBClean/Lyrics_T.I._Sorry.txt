My cup runneth over with pinot grigio hol up
You bogus in the Lambo if you aint lifting the door up
You bogus poppin pills if you aint pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For Gods sake like a wedding cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ayy never mind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it flip it we got to be rich that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker watch how you watching me
Sophisticated psychotic fly as a pilot
Officially solid all you wish you could getI got it
Unlimited titanium nigga whats in your wallet
Out of gladiator college I made it summa cum laude
Where you clowns couldnt have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January July fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me bout how Im dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me its an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn Ill be that way til I die
But find a nigga with more hustle than meI dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemars  Audemars 
Its my time to shine so fuck yall  Fuck yall 
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you cant please everybody
You cant please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
I grew up in the gutter life a motherfucker
I guess thats why I dont trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom shoot at his brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real Gs destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth but you see it over and over
Its nothing you numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it justify your action with stacking your dough up
He show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up nigga hold up
Switch the flow up cause these niggas be snitching so much
I promise all they missings a badge coffee and donut
Go to jailso what Never see my integrity perish
That aint the Harris way study my pedigree
Promise Im one of the only ones who keep it a hundred
Prolly why I think they all out to get me you cant convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slipping and hit me just like they did 50
Cause Im in the position that he think he should be given
Listen dawg the fact of the matter is
Im on a narrow path and we all cant travel


What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you cant please everybody
You cant please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What it aint What it is
Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartments way more exciting
Than a bigass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia  Woo 
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche  Ahh 
Feeling like Im going off a course  Ahh 
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life scream that til Im hoarse  Woo 
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles
Bitch he aint really got a choice  Mmm 
Im living my life live yours  Ahh 
I dont even like rapping fast  Ahh 
But thats how the world come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga thats your ass
Slow it down
This that shit thatll make you call your mama
Say Hey Im sorry for begging
For all them clothes you couldnt afford
And this the type of shit thatll make you call your rap partner
And say Im sorry Im awkward my fault for fuckin up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it  I ran from it 
Fuck it if we did
But I hope we aint lose no fans from it  No fans from it 
Im a grownass kid you know
I aint never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars just to dodge comments
And this that shit thatll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill
Dont know why but thats how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib
Yall make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon do better
We can try this shit again
Round the time the dope wear off
You feel stupid she feel lost
Thats that dopamine I mean dope
I mean you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it aint yo fault
Too much pressure I peel off Im sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me
Shit what would you do  I was 21 
Well Id probly do it differently if second the chance
Only if some coolass older man
Wouldve let me know in advance
Theres this quarry that is dug so deep in a fathers chest
When he feel that hes broken up his nest
And he figures shithe was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the Internet can say
Is That verse aint good
Its boring Boring
Really Hahahaha
When Im disgusted with this world and
I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies I dont know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl and this is what she said
She said Lay down baby baby rest your weary head ugh
A lovely distraction but my mind dont wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breast yes
Ooooh you so fucking fine I
Woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind
Ooooh who pulls your ponytail
Who knows your body well huh
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
