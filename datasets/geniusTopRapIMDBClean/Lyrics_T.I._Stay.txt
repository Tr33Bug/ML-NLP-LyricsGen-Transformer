Stay Lyrics

Hey stop goddamn fussin' all the time man, listen
I love you and I know you love me too, ohh
(I love you shawty, I know you love me)
I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay
(Fo'real, listen, ay, hey
You so high, I get what I need from you
Shawty I get on my knees for you
And I get what I need from you
I swear, I get on my knees for you)
So that we can be together forever
You wanna go to war? Wanna live in peace?
You wanna be right or be with me?
You wanna go to war? Wanna live in peace?
You wanna be right or be with me?
Who? Me! Who? Me!
That's not rhetorical, answer it, please
Who? Me! Who?
That's not rhetorical, answer it, please

Aye, I wonder would it matter much
If I never fucked and I just fell in love
Or maybe if I never fell in love and I just fucked
I swear, man, shit was simpler when I was sellin' drugs
You ain't know me then though, ain't that what ya think
You was in the bed, I was trafficking the thing
Man after everything we will never be the same
Man I'm tired of tellin' lies, know you sick of playin' games
I remember you got a tattoo, put my name on it
Put you in a wedding dress with a train on it
I went and spent a whole mil just to go chill
In Miami, and I be damned if she don't know my love real
How dare you compare me to dude, girl chill
My piece so close up on it, you don't see what it is
Shawty, I die, kill for you if you keep it real
Go to jail, even if I gotta kneel I will
You might also like
I love you and I know you love me too, ohh
(I love you shawty, I know you love me)
I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay
(Fo'real, listen, ay, hey
You so high, I get what I need from you
Shawty I get on my knees for you
And I get what I need from you
I swear, I get on my knees for you)
So that we can be together forever

You wanna go to war? Wanna live in peace?
You wanna be right or be with me?
You wanna go to war? Wanna live in peace?
You wanna be right or be with me?
Who? Me! Who? Me!
That's not rhetorical, answer it, please
Who? Me! Who?
That's not rhetorical, answer it, please

I can't see you with no me
But, you left me and I'm just me
So, I'm gon' be what they gon' be
And I know he want you but they want me
Girl, together or apart
But you be forever in my heart, I swear
And even if we end up here, I know it hard
I never love that way again, I swear to God
I be breaking down, you be playing hard
She chose to bid it all, watch how you play your cards
Now you runnin' 'round town with education hatin' broads
Going at me, got me hot, but hold up, how is they involved?
And you can't say that I ain't changed
Your whole life since we met that day
And when we get it right, God bless that day
But until then, shawty, I just pray and I just say
I love you and I know you love me too, ohh
(I love you shawty, I know you love me)
I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay
(Fo'real, listen, ay, hey
You so high, I get what I need from you
Shawty I get on my knees for you
And I get what I need from you
I swear, I get on my knees for you)
So that we can be together forever

You wanna go to war? Wanna live in peace?
You wanna be right or be with me?
You wanna go to war? Wanna live in peace?
You wanna be right or be with me?
Who? Me! Who? Me!
That's not rhetorical, answer it, please
Who? Me! Who?
That's not rhetorical, answer it, please36Embed
