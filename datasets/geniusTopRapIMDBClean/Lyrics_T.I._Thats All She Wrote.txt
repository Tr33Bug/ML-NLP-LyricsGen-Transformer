Now I dont really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago

But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
All she wrote all she wrote
I said its over with thats all she wrote
All she wrote all she wrote  Yeah 
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
Its stupid how I go in knowin everybody knowin
That Im sewin up the game destroyin life they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat and then with me they join
Others sworn under oath or banished left completely scorned  Bah 
You tell lies get cut nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track aint no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at nigga wishin they were this hot  Haha 
Guess they mad at me huh Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on Im the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone highsteppin Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known aint no blockin my shine

So call me what you want wanna hate Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper hey my dough aint in its right mind
Now I dont really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Aint nothin new I seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote


Youre starin straight into a barrel of hate terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missedwait Sarah youre late
Your train left mascara and eggs smear in your face
Nights over goodbye ho I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut aint nothin to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick whos dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I wont buy a soda
Unless its Rock and Rye cola  Faygos cheaper 
Buy you a bag of Fritos
I wouldnt let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldnt dye for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
Youll get your eyes swolled up Im on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gayass teddy bear
Bitch youre already bipolar
Now I dont really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
Its never me theyll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where Im gonna go
Still I ball like theres no tomorrow
Until its over and thats all she wrote
The credit roll the curtain close the movie over with  Thats it 
But dont get mad at me go blame the chick who wrote this shit  Nope 
Yeah life is sure a bitch  Bitch  but she know Im rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again I kick this shit give a damn got it pourin in
Peso euro yen ahha Im paid never gon be broke again
See me posted in anything wearin any chain
Never gon see me totin anything all you gon see is bang
Its so nice where I kick it hate you never get to visit
Yeah Im on another level but you niggas still cant get it
Its all over fore you finishsorry bro this where we end it
Wont give you the satisfaction of me givin you the business
Yeah I guess life is a bitch aint it Tip
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back I wouldnt give you the dirt off my handkerchief
Im givin these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
Im sure you got that relationship memo by now but in case you didnt
Ima stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker that clock Im racin it double timin it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm Im like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say KMarts like theres an apostrophe s on it dog
And they say McDonalds isnt a restaurant well I guess Im wrong
But if youre gonna tell me that AW aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg
And on my throne I remain all alone in my lane
Im as strong as they king they were gone fore they came
Now I dont wanna hang I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty thats why
Now I dont really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where Im gonna go
But still I ball like theres no tomorrow
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
All she wrote all she wrote
I said its over with thats all she wrote
All she wrote all she wrote  yeah 
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
