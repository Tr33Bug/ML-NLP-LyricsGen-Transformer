Im the man in my city aint nobody fucking wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
Im a known drug dealer I always have 50s
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SSS on 26s watching some television
Shorty Im never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me its nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living guess Im one of my dads children
Think Im bad now you shouldve seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddys daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin while Im woodgrain gripping


I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24s with a chopper in the back
Ayy holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

And now we riding Giovannis and Asanis on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck

A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live Will he die Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile Im racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
