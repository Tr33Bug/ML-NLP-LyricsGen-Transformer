Trap Back Jumping Lyrics

It’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back poppin', ho
I show these sucka niggas how it go
I show you how to move a lot of blow
Nigga say they live but they lying
So it’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back popping, bitch
Hey, now who done say I'm not the shit
Hey, nigga who you know that's hot as this
Seriously, I’ll show you how to do the shit
It's time to getting bricks out of that bag
Put that scale back on the desk
Set that vision wear on the stove
Next to that bakin' soda & pyrex
Drop that water out off that pot
Let it boil up and get high
Then whip it good with your wrist like that
Thats how you triple every brick you get
Made paper off of that yayo
Ask Jason 'bout me, bet they know
Your bitch'll fuck when I say so
Plus got head busta's on my payroll
This Bankhead, homeboy, we don’t play
Violate me and this will be your day
Catch a nigga coming out of the DOA
Hit 'em with the chopper leave 'em DOA
You can play with niggas, not me, okay?
Them other niggas suckers, I’m a G, okay?
T.I. K.I.N.G., okay?
Just respect that shit and you will be okay
Let's get this shit straight once and for all
I run this shit, bar none of y’all
And nan one of y'all niggas bigger than me
Can’t none of y’all take this city from me
Take years off and i’m still tight
I half ass and they still like it
Kick trap shit when I feel like
Them dope boys know what I live like
Dineros off kilos, big bank rolls don’t see lows
Of oz's makes zeros, here we go
You might also like
It’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back poppin', ho
I show these sucka niggas how it go
I show you how to move a lot of blow
Nigga say they live but they lying
So it’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back popping, bitch
Hey, now who done say I'm not the shit
Hey, nigga who you know that's hot as this
Seriously, I’ll show you how to do the shit

It’s time to put that work back in the stash box
Put that rent-a-car on that slab
Hit that highway from bout five day then come back and get cash
Got halves, quarters and whole things
Chevrolets and them gold things
Got Rolex, got Benzes, and it's all off of that cocaine
It’s cold game but it’s cool though
Work get gone and I move blow
Won’t sit on it, it’s too low
You got twenty-one, well, here you go
I got big whips so sick y’all
And big suites, about six broads
Your shit hot, oh yeah bro, that shit drop won’t sell much
Platinum all in my wall dawg, crib big it like a mall dawg
I’m doing numbers like call logs
Lil small money, I call y'all
My house worth your whole life, your condo's my old ice
You niggas barely in first class, I charter G4 flights
Can’t tell me shit, homie
Down here I’m good as it get, homie
Ain't nobody got shit on me
I’m a little nigga, but I’m big homie
I’m big homie , do big shit
No World Cup, I kick shit
Ride foreign, but don’t forget
I’m back trapping, got more bricks
It’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back poppin', ho
I show these sucka niggas how it go
I show you how to move a lot of blow
Nigga say they live but they lying
So it’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back popping, bitch
Hey, now who done say I'm not the shit
Hey, nigga who you know that's hot as this
Seriously, I’ll show you how to do the shit

It's time to get them pre-paids and them metros
Back activated, talk in code
Over here we got big blow
Next do' pounds uh that petro
We get dough off anything
Got Actavis if you sipping lean
Prescription pills and Molly
Even got Heroin if you 'bout it
Shawty my shop open up all night
Got blocks stacked up all white
Don't like me, that's alright
Come fight me, nigga, yeah right
A nigga get wrong and getting dead right
On your ass, ho
Get embarrassed, ho
All about my cash flow
Your new bitch was my last ho
I got six sluts in my Maybach
Sixpack under my tanktop
I got a snub nose that hold six shots
Nigga try me, I think not
My temper bad, I might blank out
Bust a nigga before I can even think about
What I got to lose if he bust a move
Well, I got to do what I got to do
Trap rolling, bumping, always selling something
You got it if you want it and whatever for the money
On my grind, they in line for the product from the dime up
They know where to find him, do you know what it time for

It’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back poppin', ho
I show these sucka niggas how it go
I show you how to move a lot of blow
Nigga say they live but they lying
So it’s time to get trap back jumping
Get shit back popping, bitch
Hey, now who done say I'm not the shit
Hey, nigga who you know that's hot as this
Seriously, I’ll show you how to do the shit3Embed
