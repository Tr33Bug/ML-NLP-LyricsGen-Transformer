Ugh
No we will not
Ugh no
No we will not stand here in silence
While they take the lives of our brothers and sisters and partnas
We will not turn a blind eye to the murder with no repercussions
Oh no we will not
We will not live on our knees we will die on our feet
This aint no lie that I speak
All you youngins out here in the streets only wanna shoot people who look like you
You can stay home you too weak
Oh no we will not go and repeat the mistakes of the past
Ignorin the snakes in the grass payin you cash
Still we pray and we fast til one day thats your ass
We will not ask for no war
Nononononono but we will be prepared for one
Hopin not with a gun
With the unity using the same shit you did to destroy me
We sick of the garbage you kickin and teachin
And lynchin us lockin us up for no reason
And killin us no consequences convictions you serious
Lyin about what you show in the media
Assassinate all the leaders who leadin us
Leave us with ones who misleadin us
Then go and reward all the ones who mistreat us
And leave us in projects and give us these poisonous products
On top of narcotics to push to our sisters and brothers
Like them aint our sisters and brothers
No we will not be run amuck led astray
Or bamboozled the buckll be stoppin today
See what happen when athletesll no longer play for you
Tell them accountants to pray for you
On respect or just respect what that paperll do
Look up it too late for you droppin you off
Turnin them profits to loss when we wont go shop in the mall
United we all stuck in this bullshit together
Showin these folk we just wont take whatever
Or else they just roll up and shoot up whatever
Just like theyve been doin forever
The niggas swear they hard be huffin and puffin
But aint gon do nothin the enemy try em
They wait behind enemy lines
Why you tryna be so friendly now Handle your business now
And we wont fear nothin but judgement from God
Standin there lookin at me sayin you aint do nothin
I bless you when you aint invested in nothin
Just kept up the cycle of death and destruction
Ignornin your neighbor wont help him but helpin yourself
Just like the devil himself hmm
Promote all that fornication
All that baby makin aint no baby raisin for a generation
Now they trapped in systems cause incarceration
Was inevitable due to education
Substandard institution never cared
Js drop buyin every pair
Crack rock crip blood all the 80
GDP and whatever else separate us
Hiphop king you finally made it your time to take it
Pass Martin Luther all that money and you still blew it
Didnt save and you feel stupid ITunes came and they bootleggin
What you get for bein hard headed God damn nigga
Might as well gon and go to hell nigga
Cause I tried as hard as I can nigga
I know you only a man but God damn nigga
They dont scare negros today with no badge or no white skin or no white sheet or no white anything else They police the same way they put their club upside your head and then turn around and accuse you of attacking them Every case of police brutality against a negro follows the same pattern  they attack you bust you all upside your mouth and then take you to court and charge you with assault What kind of democracy is that
