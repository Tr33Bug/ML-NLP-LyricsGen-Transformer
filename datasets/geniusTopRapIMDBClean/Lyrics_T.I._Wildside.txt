Smoking weed riding chrome
Only thing Ive ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin keys spraying Ks
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Come take a little walk with me through my neighborhood and come spend a day in my trap
Get your paper right and that yay some good but just keep a tool in your lap
My lil patna holding that work nigga want weight then keep around back
Better not violate on my turf nigga yous in danger to die like that
Aint no investigation no statements and no witnesses we aint seen shit
Pull up after dark with that jewelry on to come see a bitch that way he get it
We on dark road with no street lights that pistol play after fist fights
And them geek monsters walk all night with they crack pipes tryna get right
Midnight we shoot dice the whole house smelling like cooked crack
You beat me and you talk shit you get shot bitch and I took that
Hoodrats on deck that loud is all I blow
This shit to you might sound wild but this life is all I know
Smoking weed riding chrome
Only thing Ive ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin keys spraying Ks
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Can you picture me back in 93 bumpin Dr Dre while I hit some weed
Cut school made ten G thirteen trying to get keys
At fifteen I was fullgrown get wrong get bust on
My uncle gave me a bunch of work and that shit was gone by the next morning
Young wild nigga runnin with me homicide wasnt nothing to us
Dead body wasnt nothin to see that pistol play was just fun to us
I was 19 with two felonies one of my best friend had a life sentence
How my uncle Fred was just like me and had a bunch of partners no longer living
All about that cocaine dealing no education no pot to piss in
Old school on chrome wheel window tinted pistol hidden
Thats the shit that I come from in my heart fear aint none
Stand tall I cant run from that wildside that I walk on
Smoking weed riding chrome
Only thing Ive ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin keys spraying Ks
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives


Uh yeah
All I ever did was put on all my old friends tryna get on
Shorty fell out making diss songs never talk down when I get home
Aint the type of nigga you can shit on hundred spokes brick chrome
God body big bone thats hard body Jim Jones
Niggas know the sound of how we switch on him finna wild out on a Tip song
Better make a toast nigga Tip home first get the bread then get going
From the land of the lead where they spit chrome where most kids never get to live long
Get their pistols get pissed on pistolwhipped and stripped homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me caught them talking down tryna bitch on me
And they snitch on me aint got shit on me so my guess is death is what they wish on me
So Im blowing on them candles closed lids and dark eyes
Cause hates never part time when you on that wildside
Smoking weed riding chrome
Only thing Ive ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin keys spraying Ks
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
