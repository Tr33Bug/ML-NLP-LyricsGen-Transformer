1 2 3  ooh yea
Ooh ohoh
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind
That I put down in words how wonderful life is
Hey TIP lemme holla at ya
Making yo momma proud looking in yo daughters eyes
Kickin it with your sons trippin never realize
How good you got it been so wrapped up in yo losses
You couldnt see the profits could still be in the projects
Instead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin
So you went back to prison TIP It couldve been a coffin
Now since we talkin you been trippin ever since I died
Appreciate you missin me but G you still alive
Im lookin down at you and sendin smiles to you
I checked the wedding out oh tell Tamika hi would you
Told you she would get you thats good cuz shawty ride with you
Kids getting big seen King riding a bicycle
See Niq Niq drive a car see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin and hes spittin too
Little Deyjah beautiful and Major supercool
My life is over with dawg your life is good to you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
And you can tell everybody this is your song
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind
That I put down in words how wonderful life is
Sit down son
And listen to me son and pay attention to me
Seems like Im the only one that you would listen to
I never knew the time that I aint get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go its painful I already know
The past is the past just learn from the grown
So you got crystal wit you And your sister Precious too
Im proud of you did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
Thats why I was so much harder on you knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer I wasnt much of a talker
Great to see you doin better than me even as a father
Taking care of yo mama overcoming the drama
Your life is wonderful son dont let em take it from you
Keep living it to the fullest treasure it its a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty when its over with forget it
Damn
What up Phil So good to hear from you we missing you  freal 
Remembering all of our conversations daily reminiscing you
The hood today they lost can tell they dont know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear its so unfair that Im right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I cant rest and I cant do shit off my mind Im so upset
It wasnt your time to beat me there broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me familiys never forgiving me
I know but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner aint quite the future you wanted for me
Was it And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything Ive known owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me didnt graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me so long had this bottled up
Til we meet in person lets keep speaking through my verses for life
This is your song
