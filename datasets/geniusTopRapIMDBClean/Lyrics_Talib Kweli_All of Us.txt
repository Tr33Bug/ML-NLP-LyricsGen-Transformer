We must love and support each other 
We have nothing to lose but our chains
We have nothing to lose but our chains 
Now you say that shit so loud them motherfuckers outside hear you
It is our duty to fight for our freedom
It is our duty to fight for our freedom 
It is our duty to win  It is our duty to win 
We must love and support each other
We must love and support each other 
We have nothing to lose  We have nothing to lose 
We have nothing to lose  We have nothing to lose 
We have nothing to lose  We have nothing to lose 
But our chains  But our chains 
Send this one out to
To the mothers  they neglected  to the fathers  they rejected 
To the sisters  disrespected  to the brothers  unprotected 
All of us  all of us  all of us  all of us  all of us
We send this one out to
To the mothers  they deceited  to the fathers  they mistreated 
To the sisters  they misleaded  to the brothers  that get beated 
All of us  all of us  all of us  all of us  all of us
This is happening to all of us
Yeah if our struggle is a strain then the strain is dominant
My name is prominent for entertainment thats laced with consciousness
But really its just common sense like Lonnie Lynn
You dont need binoculars to see the light coming through the dome like its an oculus
The common myth that were savages with no history or accomplishments
Or knowledge of ourselves they did a job on us
Considering the prediction of economists machines will do our jobs for us
The future for the working class is ominous
They got us indoctrinated through a bitchs brew a religion mixed in with abuse
Emotional we sit in pews its physical we get the noose
And hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves refuse to change ourselves
When I talk about our past it doesnt ring a bell
They make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
Theyll take you from your family your kids will never respect ya
Attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message
We start acting if we cracking the whip better than the oppressor yes
Every problem cant be solved at the ballot box
We unifying Africa like Gaddafi thats what got Malcolm shot
They out to stop anybody with knowledge that figured out the plot
On the balcony like Martin Luther King I been to the mountaintop
The blue wall of silence its really the blue wall of violence
The good cops who retire and get fired
They screaming black on black as an excuse for you to not care
Til the cops roll up in their SWAT gear


I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan
Sweating all through the night just like the Holy Prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with J Cole and Kweli
Just before Jehovah the God crowned me the king with his goldie locket
Alhamdulillah weve come really far aint it
The little engine who could could power any car cant it
The mothers in Chiraq say the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times the holy Quran and Bible
We on the last page and line the verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the matrix inside of the spaceship but the saviors blind
Or so it seems years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs
I hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways
Officer friendly is an enemy now looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the asiatic ancientsemitic peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple
To the mothers  they neglected  to the fathers  they rejected 
To the sisters  disrespected  to the brothers  unprotected 
All of us  all of us  all of us  all of us  all of us
We send this one out to
To the mothers  they deceited  to the fathers  they mistreated 
To the sisters  they misleaded  to the brothers  that get beated 
All of us  all of us  all of us  all of us  all of us
This is happening to all of us
To the mothers  they neglected  to the fathers  they rejected 
To the sisters  disrespected  to the brothers  unprotected 
All of us  all of us  all of us  all of us  all of us
We send this one out to
To the mothers  they deceited  to the fathers  they mistreated 
To the sisters  they misleaded  to the brothers  that get beated 
All of us  all of us  all of us  all of us  all of us
This is happening to all of us
Weve got to live
Live to the end  we gotta do we do 
Weve got to live  for our grandmothers 
Live to the end  and granddaddies too 
Weve got to live  live for the babies 
Live to the end  my brothers out there going crazy
