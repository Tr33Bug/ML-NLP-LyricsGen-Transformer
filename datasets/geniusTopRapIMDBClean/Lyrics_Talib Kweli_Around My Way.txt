Around my way
Around my way
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way
People let me paint a picture
You know I aint a Christian
I aint a Muslim aint a Jew
Im losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I aint knocking you but I dont fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what Im a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
Im on the block Im tracing your footsteps I keep the faith in you
Your love plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through my songs is psalms Im spiritual when Im lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin gypsy cabs and chasin 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags wrapping them around our heads
When niggas aint become American till 911
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend
These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
LA to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four cock it back
Drop the flow rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
Youll finish school but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way
