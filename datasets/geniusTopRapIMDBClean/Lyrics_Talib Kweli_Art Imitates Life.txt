Lets toast to paid mortgages lasting marriages
Tina Farriss pay King to Paris
Living long making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest the legacy the heritage
Im out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is
And we dont need Theraflu we need therapists
Them neverending pursuit of them dead presidents
Is the reason I got the band back together bitch
Yeah its me and  and his 
North side bomb squad Eric Vietnam
If you dont see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all Im thinking bout is whats up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate
Thats my art in your eyes my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But Imma show you how it is
Imma show you how we get in
Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like Im going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
Im blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangsters paradise like Im Coolio
Thats what a few believe like a doobie roll
We off of that Patrn we sipping the Don Julio
You talking shit we dont need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out put they foot in their mouth
Thats when Im letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off
The music thats creating a movement like its December 4th
Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white
Animated like its kind of darklit its my wicked life
It imitate my life


Yeah yall keeping it 3hunnid we keeping it 360
Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying Im the best I wont waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back I say it never left
Yall just catching up so slow to come around
IceT gave ya cliff notes I aint gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it and set the precedence
And get the presidents fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack and Imma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed aint gotta kiss ass
I aint gotta slim fast smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you aint a fan boo roll a bamboo
Life imitating art imitating life show you how the fam do
