This is a tear jerker
The revolutions here
No one can lead you off your path
Youll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
Youll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
Yo I heard its said the revolution wont be televised
But in the land of milk and honey theres a date you gotta sell it by
Otherwise it just expires and spoils
And these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
Cause the fire boils inside
You go to church to find you some religion
And all you hear is connivin and gossip and contradiction and
You try to vote and participate in the government
And the muhfuckin Democrats is actin like Republicans
You join a organization that know black history
But ask them how they plan to make money and its a mystery
Lookin for the remedy but you cant see whats hurtin you
The revolutions here the revolution is personal
They call me the political rapper
Even after I tell em I dont fuck with politics
I dont even follow it
Im on some KRS Ice Cube Chris Wallace shit
Main Source De La Soul bumpin 2Pacalypse Now
The revolutions here
No one can lead you off your path
Youll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
Youll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh


Yo I speak at schools a lot cause they say Im intelligent
No its cause Im dope if I was whack Id be irrelevant
Im like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin to the left the laughters the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just cant laugh away
Stay optimistic thinking change is gonna come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray on top of that act today
Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in Cast Away
Everybody pass away the pastor prays the family mournin
Everybody act accordin to the season that they born in  Youll try to change the world 
You fight in the streets start bleedin til the blood is pourin
In the gutter mothers cry til the Lord be livin by the sword and
All that folks want is safety they goin gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin war games in the 80s
The same reason I always rock dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful Im too strong for your slavery
The revolutions here
No one can lead you off your path
Youll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
Youll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
The revolutions here
No one can lead you off your path
Youll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
