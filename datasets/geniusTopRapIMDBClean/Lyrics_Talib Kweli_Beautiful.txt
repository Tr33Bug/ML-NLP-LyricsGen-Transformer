No matter what the obstacle is we fight through it
To survive is only half the battle we wont lose it
So have faith in better days on the way
I lend my hand to you whenever you need me Ill stay
I understand sometimes the world is type cloudy
But like a plane thats over the game we fly out it
Determination dedication til the end
Im there every step of the way until we win
Cause I believe in prayer in God Almighty
Get them burdens off your shoulder send them to the highest
But we can beat it overcome the lows
Being positive is key you believe and it shows
I spread awareness be mindful of your health
Be here for one another so you never by yourself
One step at a time one time for the cause
I rep it for the world I rap it for us all
Dont run away from who you are
Lifes beautiful  life is beautiful 
Pick yourself back on up
Lifes beautiful  life is so beautiful 
This the highway of life we stay driven
Then at some point you arrive at a decision
To fly high we weather any condition
We doing more than surviving because we living
The music feel good  yes sir itll satisfy you
Like a meal would real good when its going down
Its the flavor that you savor when you wait
It tastes great  compliments to the chef he got taste
Clean your plate clear the music in front of a glass of water
Taking stale pictures see the crystals forming
The horns make me feel victorious the keys make me feel glorious
The drums make me feel like a warrior
The track feel big Notorious
Do it for the people feeling trapped in the corridor
Nobody know what youre going through in a day
But dont let yesterday ruin today
And they say
They say its all for the money but I dont wan believe it
Im a man of my word so whatever you been hearing
Is the truth  flatline polygraph thats me
We could all use a break  spare of Apache
Catch me crossing items off my bucket list
Cause life is good as you want it to get
I paint a different portrait with any color I find
The canvas is the world and the brush is my mind
I dont mind stepping out my comfort zone
I think the greatest fear is the one of the unknown
If you afraid of living and you afraid of death
Then Im afraid youll never take a step to the left
Or the right direction
Tonights confession  I used to be scared of my own reflection
And what would really happen if I fought that vision
But the matter all along  if its not good its gone
