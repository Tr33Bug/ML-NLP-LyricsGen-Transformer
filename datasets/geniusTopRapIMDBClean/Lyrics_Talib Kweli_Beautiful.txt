Beautiful Lyrics
No matter what the obstacle is, we fight through it
To survive is only half the battle, we won't lose it
So have faith in better days on the way
I lend my hand to you, whenever you need me I'll stay
I understand sometimes, the world is type cloudy
But like a plane that's over the game, we fly out it
Determination, dedication til the end
I'm there every step of the way, until we win
Cause I believe in prayer, in God Almighty
Get them burdens off your shoulder, send them to the highest
But we can beat it, overcome the lows
Being positive is key, you believe and it shows
I spread awareness, be mindful of your health
Be here for one another so you never by yourself
One step at a time, one time for the cause
I rep it for the world, I rap it for us all
Don't run away from who you are
Life's beautiful (life is beautiful)
Pick yourself back on up
Life's beautiful (life is so beautiful)

This the highway of life, we stay driven
Then at some point, you arrive at a decision
To fly high, we weather any condition
We doing more than surviving because we living
The music feel good -- yes sir, it'll satisfy you
Like a meal would, real good when it's going down
It's the flavor that you savor when you wait
It tastes great -- compliments to the chef, he got taste
Clean your plate, clear the music in front of a glass of water
Taking stale pictures, see the crystals forming
The horns make me feel victorious, the keys make me feel glorious
The drums make me feel like a warrior
The track feel big, Notorious
Do it for the people feeling trapped in the corridor
Nobody know what you're going through in a day
But don't let yesterday ruin today
And they say..

You might also like
They say it's all for the money, but I don't wan' believe it
I'm a man of my word, so whatever you been hearing
Is the truth -- flatline, polygraph, that's me
We could all use a break -- spare of Apache
Catch me crossing items off my bucket list
Cause life is good as you want it to get
I paint a different portrait with any color I find
The canvas is the world and the brush is my mind
I don't mind stepping out my comfort zone
I think the greatest fear is the one of the unknown
If you afraid of living and you afraid of death
Then I'm afraid you'll never take a step to the left
Or the right direction
Tonight's confession -- I used to be scared of my own reflection
And what would really happen if I fought that vision
But the matter all along -- if it's not good, it's gone
