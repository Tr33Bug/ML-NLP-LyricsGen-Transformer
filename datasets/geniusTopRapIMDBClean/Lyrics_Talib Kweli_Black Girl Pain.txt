My mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way still youve come so far
They just know the name they dont know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Dont be ashamed of yourself know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
They just know the name they dont know the pain Black girl
I do it for the people I do it for the love
I do it for the poet I do it for the thug
This is for victory and this is for the slaughter
I do it for my mother I do it for my daughter
Promise Ill always love ya I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your brother should be looking out for one another
Im so blessed man yall the reason I got up
Somebody put his hands on you Im getting locked up
Im not playing thats the prayer Im saying for Diani
And if I die then shell be protected by Amani
Thats her bigger brother and I love the way he love her
She a girlygirl she love to imitate her mother
But she a Gemini so stay on her friendly side
Shell put that look on you its like somebody friend just died
My pretty Black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting Black business
Teach her what black is the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free she aint no black zombie
This is for Aisha this is for Kashera
This is for Khadijah scared to look up in the mirror
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a Black girl name she living Black girl pain
This is for Makeba and for my Mamacita
Whats really good Ma Ill be your promisekeeper
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a black girl name she live in black girl pain
Mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way still weve come so far
They just know the name they dont know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Dont be ashamed of yourself know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
Cause they just know the name they dont know the pain Black girl
This is for Beatrice Bertha Benjamin who gave birth to Tsidi Azeeda
For Lavender Hill for Khayelitsha
Athlone Mitchells Plain Swazi girls Im repping for thee
Manenberg Gugulethu where youd just be blessed to get through
For beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Coloured for realizing were African
For all my cousins back home the strength of Mommys backbone
The length of which she went for raising sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elnas back I march
Fist raised caramel shining in all our glory
For Mauritius St Helena my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Eadie for Norma Leslie Ndidi
For Auntie Betty for Melanie all the same family
Fiona Jo Burg complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
This worlds yours and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls raise up your hands the world should clap for us
Mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way still weve come so far
They just know the name they dont know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Dont be ashamed of yourself know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
Cause they just know the name they dont know the pain Black girl
Momma said theyll be days like this
