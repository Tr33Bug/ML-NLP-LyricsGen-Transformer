Been around the world many times
Seen many things
And they in color too
Seen women so beautiful
That I could die with a smile on my face
And not feel like the good lord gypped me
The space between love and me
Between 
How you expect to have an ordinary relationship with such an
Extraordinary nigga yeah theres flaws in what you figured
Aint the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her
I like my fantasies halfstripper halfglass slipper
Wrappin one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book coming to life when Im
Flipping through the pictures switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and Im loving the way you sound
And Im smothering and Im grindin now doubt is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and up against the cupboard till we
Look like turquoise  Right on the couch
Yellow on the bad day  Knocking it out without a doubt
Colors of you 
Eyo the world is my coloring book look new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines
Colors of you 
Eyo the world is my coloring book look new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines
Color of you 
My self expression acquire every color in the spectrum
My self reflection make the light change direction
When you see it from this angle the color the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down thats the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase go off the grid for a
Few days go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity
In a world of respect and Im trading it like its currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella Im wishin his fella right his wrong
But naw instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My lightll poke through the clouds well take you higher like you
Smoking the loud while I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears you can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yea


Colors of you 
You dont look like turquoise
You dont look like gold
You dont look like purple
Thatll match your hue
Eyo the world is my coloring book look new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines
Colors of you  Ay ay
Eyo the world is my coloring book look new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines hey
Colors of you 
Colors of you
