Come Here Lyrics
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Why you so far away? You need to feel this
I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts
I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you
Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable
Your whole style is colder than Minnesota
I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over
We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer
We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Like a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor
Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure
I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like "sure"
She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby
As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali
She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown
Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around
This last bird probably flew the coop
Blastin' Outkast, last words: "Ooh-Dee-Whoo"
I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi... how you say, "voulez vous?"
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider
You might also like
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me

Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
While I manage, just serving long sentences, no commas
Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
You the Earth, that's emphatically "yes"
But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't gotta ask her "why you stare" - that's a "yes"
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby4Embed
