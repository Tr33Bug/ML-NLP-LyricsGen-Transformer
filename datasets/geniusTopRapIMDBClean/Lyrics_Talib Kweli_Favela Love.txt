Ohhhhhhhh
Last night I had a dream that was so real
I woke up in a cold sweat it felt so ill
I stared into the face of an angel
Tainted by the city you aint from this place itll change you
Walkin by I thought I was sly
Offered to try at first I thought she was shy
Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him cast a glance in my direction started dancin to my section
Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight Eva Mendes in The Other Guys
Got me in another zone  they call her Sunshine like
Put your mother on the phone I aint comin home
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start
My favela love man I fell in love man I fell in love
Man I fell in love man I fell in love
Man I man I fell in love
Man I man I uh
Ehhhh a gente  desse jeito mesmo  diferente
Ehhhh  brasileiro  swingueiro  corao
Ehhhh a gente  que bota f na vida pode cre
Tamo ai para viver para encarar
Ehhh  A vida pro que der e vier
nois que t na fita agora pode cr
Brasil crescendo a gente t ai para aparecer
Se voce quiser colar com a gente no tem nada no
A gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma unio
Brasil o povo de mistura raca p no cho
Objectividade na vontade de crescer
A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin my language is romantic
Vocabulary thats bustin your capillaries
My freedomll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak Ill of my name Im so sick
Attack is very guerilla my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place its gravitational
Profit stay in the black the shade is so unfadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
Im Lee Scratch Perry they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr International call it the bruschetta the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
Youre lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
From a boss in my prime look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired I stay wired like I was offered a line
Uh uh
I dont wanna bang it or beat it hit it or stab it
Youre listenin to voodoo I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic you bubble it dont stop
It might blow up but it wont go pop
Pow Thats the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you  Rockin My Boat  like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave Im gonna miss you  Official  like Kardinal
Trust Ill come back and Ill visit for carnival
When I come back around take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down
My favela love man I fell in love man I fell in love
Man I fell in love man I fell in love
Man I man I fell in love
Man I yea yea yea
