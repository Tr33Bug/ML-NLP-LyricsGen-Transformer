You are now witnessing the demise of the music business
I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what Im saying
I cant do music with people Im uncomfortable with
You know what Im saying
I cant be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I dont like you
So with that said shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
Thats my Blacksmith family you dig
I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah those was the salad days my careers appetizer
The main course a casserole a jambalaya
Of different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers tutelage
Paying for college not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this was
Hard to tell my parents  sat them down tried to get through to them
Started flowing daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubix and Juju on Flatbush my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus  whats up Jarret and Brian Blackshaw
And Matt Fingaz Kendra Ross you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with HiTek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smyth shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots they played so well
Writing rhymes with Myka 9
Me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in common
Mystik Journeymen introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Aint no mountain high enough for him he never stopped climbing
Thats why when the homies win I never stop smiling
See Im smiling right now
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt thats how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the God in me
Friends and family yup they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family thats right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up its like you all my fam
Friends and family like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
It started with a blast now Im a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl your mother never far away
This is for Eque this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
HeadCquarterz and Guru is love forever yall
Make it plain cause its too strong for a metaphor or simile
Your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Til the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad  you could have done worse
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt thats how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the God in me
Friends and family yup they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family thats right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up its like you all my fam
Friends and family like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
First record was with Mood back in 96
In fact it was pretty fresh Google that find that shit
It sound good I was showing you what timeless is
You couldnt catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and Manifesto
So much wack rap I know its hard to tell the difference
But when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
Im resurrected but Im no savior
I know the game I can ball a little bit  Im an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered
We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
To snap back like the jaws of gators
