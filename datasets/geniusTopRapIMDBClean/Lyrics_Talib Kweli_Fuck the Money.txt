I used to put the money first yall still do
But that hardly works cause yall still ask for prices from
The waiters and youre hardly served
You pay once you pay forever that you cant reverse
Thats why I aint paid Talib for no fuckin verse
Mutual respect over below payments
Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery
I been listenin and four quarters of yall wont make it
Im Africas number one thats a fuckin bold statement
And Im the most relevant
You failin to admit that is your biggest impediment
Were not on the same level man
Your dream girl sent me nudes and Im checkin em
Underneath the table as Im havin dinner with the president
Man fuck the money
O tsenya tlhogo then otla ka plane
Eh sane being brokes for makgokgorane
They love cause they know Im bein real to my peeps
Theres niggas richer than me who still wish they were me

Money make niggas break promises
Money turn niggas into pharmacists
Money make you drop outta colleges
But the bars that I spit through God exist
Who we be thats who we are
Versace Gucci Louis Vuitton
My taste expensive as a superstar
So I take what I want like a coup dtat
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for Gods appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth thats a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat need money to live
Need money to keep need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when its sent we come to our nations capital to cash the check
According to Dr King when he saw it clear in his dream
We built the pyramids they built a pyramid scheme
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
Fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money fuck the money
