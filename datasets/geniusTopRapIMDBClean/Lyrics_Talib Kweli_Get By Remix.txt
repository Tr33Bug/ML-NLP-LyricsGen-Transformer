Get By  Remix  Lyrics
History
Its happening every day yall
Right now
Everyday  Live right now 
Right now
Good morning Vietnam
Listen Brooklyn wins again
Its the Stuy its the Bush them niggas again
Ta Kweli Mighty Def and S Dot on the guest lock
Kanye youre the dopeman of hiphop now lets rock
And roll out niggas  Roll out  my hometown niggas  Ouu ouu 
I get it good in your hood so slow down niggas
Watch the speed though mind your pedal and ease off
Or screech off into a collision course with these walls  BAM 
You dont move dont pray dont lose
Dont sleep life passing light flashing life happens
That fast part of done Black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear dying wish is to touch the air
Seekin heaven that wasnt here
Eyes will not see another year its another day
Its the same fight different round sound the bell
Mix it up in victory you live it up the beatll get risen up
Youre knocked down then get back and get it up
Get off of Queer Street and get with us  Ha 
And get clear where we did it from the heart from the people
From the top from the Jeep from the gut from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence you feel the presenceexactly
I make contactfor short I MC  Mos 
Me and mine we dont just get by we get free  Nigga 
And thats ready
Just to get by nigga I sold coke nigga I pushed lah
Carried a fourfive claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry held it all inside
Reality was too much to take so I
Kept my mind fried slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes then I woke up behind
Thinking either I load up these nines or blow up with rhymes
Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah Im a poster from what happens seeing your moms
Doing five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me
Picture me working McDonalds  Yeah yeah 
Id rather pull a MAC on you  Ugh yeah 
Sorry Ms Jackson but Im packin bye
Yeah Its somethin about that Nina Simone piano flow
Its like a Michelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get ya choked up this is the tree and the rope
This is Chi nigga Im Mr AllofThat
Fuck a map lets put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin for Lacs what you sittin on
Tracks who you spittin on rap til we get it on
And dont let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you aint got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me Toughen up put some bass in your voice
They used to tell me Lighten up put some Mase in your voice
Lord willin I aint killed nobody
But I have a feelin this album that Im gonna make a killin
Or not a shilling this is loveitorhateit music
Butat least we made it music
And we didnt make it industry this is gon be interesting
Thisll be the end of me or Im finna be an entity
Kanye JayZ Mos Def and Kweli
We are not makin songs no more were makin history


This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get  by  just to get  by 
Just to get  by  just to get  get buh buh buh bye bye 
Just to get by just to get by 
Just to get by  just to get get buh buh buh bye bye
We keep it gangsta say fo shizzle fo sheezy
Desensitized by the violence on the TV during the war
Killin each other is easy its pourin liquor for fallen niggas
Believe me its ghetto libation seen it all before
Just to get by my people we get fly
My people we get high fillin cigars with the lah
Nigga come on Even Jesus was stoned
Before receivin the throne
I send a rest in peace to Nina Simone
Back in the days we was used to doin the shit
I cant call it all in the streets
We was hustlin fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin on corners
Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin the week was good so I could get money back
To get by just to get by just to get by just to get by 
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin me smokin Newports and weed
To get by just to get by just to get by just to get by 
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggas and street mothafuckas
And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother
To get by just to get by just to get by just to get by 
Ayo Mom pick up the phone I gotta to talk to you Ma
If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building in session
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get  by  just to get  by 
Just to get  by  just to get  get buh buh buh bye bye 
Some people try some people try
Just to get by for my piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie
And we keepin it fly  yo yo yo yo yo
When people decice to keep a disguise
Cant see your eyes see the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind
I stay readin the signs
