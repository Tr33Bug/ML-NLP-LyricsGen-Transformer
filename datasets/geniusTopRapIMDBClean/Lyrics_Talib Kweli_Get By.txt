Yeah
Ya know
Yeah
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk and the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too like Attack of the Clones
Work til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bones
To get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while your egos spread rumors
We survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
Ask Him why some people gotta live in a trailer cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth they hot like the jail cell in the south
Before my nigga Cor bailed me out
To get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
We do or die like BedStuy
See the red sky out the window of the redeye
Let the lead fly on some G Rap shit livin to let die
Now this morning I woke up
Feelin brand new I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows and my soul
And my goals just to stop smokin and stop drinkin
And Ive been thinkin Ive got my reasons
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
By bybybyby bybybyby
Bybybyby bybybyby
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
By bybybyby bybybyby
Bybybyby bybybyby
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by hey hey
We keep it gangsta say fo shizzle fo sheezy and stay crunk
Its easy to pull a breezy smoke trees and we stay drunk
Yo our activism attackin the system the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen they victims lackin the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let em know we missin you the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal I aint bullshittin you
Now why would I lie Just to get by
Just to get by we get fly
The TV got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars
The ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin to rely on we get high on all types of drug
When all you really need is love
To get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop what
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows and my soul
And my goals just to stop smokin and stop drinkin
And Ive been thinkin Ive got my reasons
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
Yoyoyo yo yo
Some people cry and some people try
Just to get by for a piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high we deceive and we lie
And we keepin it fly yyyyo yo
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Cant see they eyes see the evil inside
But theres people you find strong or feeble in mind
I stay readin the signs yyyyo yo yo
Some people cry and some people try
Just to get by for a piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high we deceive and we lie
And we keepin it fly yyyyo yo
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Cant see they eyes see the evil inside
But theres people you find strong or feeble in mind
I stay readin the signs yyyyo yo
As long as somebodys feelin it thats whats up
