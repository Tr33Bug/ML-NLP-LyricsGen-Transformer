Ghetto to ghetto backyard to yard
We tear it up yall bless the mic with the gods
Precious metals round our necks and arms
We tear it up yall bless the mic with the gods
Ghetto to ghetto backyard to yard
We tear it up yall bless the mic with the gods
Precious metals round our necks and arms
We tear it up yall bless the mic with the gods
Whatevers in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look its never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
Ive been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto
Black magic in the hood its tragic but understood
Crack addicts crack windows crack wood
Even whats bad becomes good status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling shit seems real and
Whats real is the estate of mind that were in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate
If lyrics sold then truth be told
Id probably be just as rich and famous as JAYZ
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense
Cause its the music the blues its the jazz its acoustics
Soul Rock and Roll the hiphop that we producin yea
Its the gear its the flare its the stare
Nowadays theyll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers pour a beer shoot the air
We got our own elected officials no matter who the mayor
I know you know what Im talking about
From New York to the South take off your shoes when you walk in the house
Whatevers in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look its never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
Ive been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto
Yo I grew up where theyre playin skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah BIG and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you dont really see the stars a lot
But rappin drinkin and goin to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hiphop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It aint harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like sticman and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw these kids dont run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more
A man in front of the store beggin for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard its a drought
Up early servin from their grandmothers house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God but you try to get by
Its like the block keep blockin
You try to make moves its like the car keep stoppin
These shorties in the court need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin me and Kwe keep rockin for the ghetto
Whatevers in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look its never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
Ive been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto
Whatevers in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look its never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
Ive been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto
