Ready or not
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  yup they giving us 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  word 
Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally thats confusion to a youngn tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say thats where you go when you die
But how they know
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  yup they giving us 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  yup they giving us 
Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons it was a blessing not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and thats where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
Thats why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that aint vein to me
Its just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin to go inside
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  yup they giving us 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  yup 
Living in mass confusion looking for absolution
The gas seducin and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
Momma say its her after me
Preacher say its blasphemy
I say theres gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God heres you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean
We know  hey 
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  yup they giving us 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  its all going to 
Hell  yup we living in 
Hell  yup they giving us 
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd dont mean I gotta be no sheep
You feel me
More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history
We saying the same thing
