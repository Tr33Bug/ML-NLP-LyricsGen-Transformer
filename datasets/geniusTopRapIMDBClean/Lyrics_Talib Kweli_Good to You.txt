Wanna be good to you 
We make the squares dance and get the dough like dosey
Yall niggas roll with pussycats like Josie
All spoiled rotten like ghetto groceries yo
I clutch the mic like ya grandma clutch her rosary yo
Swoop in the industry like a bird to prey
My stanzas got stamina ya verses lack vertebrae
I heard them say I was a conscious rapper
But Im a monster when I have to smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my hands solo and I dont need Chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis yo
I write screen gems yall niggas act in B movies
Type of niggas proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd runnin over the cliff
Im the Buffalo Soldier smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowin the spliff loadin a clip to spit high
Like you holdin blow in a stolen whip rolling the strip
Looking to hit cops now thats a four alarm
Black queen fallin on my arms you could call it charm
Matter fact call it what you want its up to you bruh
Wanna be good to you  Yeah yeah yeah


Call it skill call it game call it glow call my name
Like the lord all in vain screamin like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug all up in ya vein cause
Wanna be good to you 
How many niggas ever been in love
How many niggas really think they thugs
And cant think without the drink and drugs
How many niggas cant get in with hats and sneakers on
Say Fuck security and get inside and keep them on
How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Cant do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eatin on
That dont take heart slave nigga play ya part
Id rather jump overboard nigga face the sharks
We stay doin it later for the conversation
Hammers is cocked and waitin niggas is not debating
We aint got the patience You found poppin shit
Come in to town just to run you down like poppa ditch
And dig a proper ditch you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my house you aint no real Representative

Niggas is sensitive see how they catchin feelings
Its so hot the sweat rise and it wet the ceiling
Barracuda Spitkicker nigga thats the crew  Wanna be good to you

You the hardest on the beat Im the fire that you playin with
You a artist from the street Ill give you the blood to paint it with
So yeah Im positive Im positive Im the best
Spit bullets to split ya vest and deposit them in ya chest
Dark is the flesh on my bones calling Brooklyn home
Hang up on niggas like I want you to meet my nigga tone word
Leave me alone like Michael Jackson
Or there will be more than butterflies in your stomach
Waiting to see what happens
You see me out know that my crew is flawless
Socalled gangstas need more security than the Rawkus office
Yo I thought you bust ya gun
You just a big joke thinkin you a Big Pun
