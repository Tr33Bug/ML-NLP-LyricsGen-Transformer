Good to You Lyrics
Yeah, come on
Uh (Yeah), aight
(Kweli, '02)
Yo, yo

Ayo, my silent moments, loud as the crack of thunder
My hunger like the crocodile that attacks the hunter
It ain't commercial or underground, it's true 'cause I—
(Wanna be good to you)
Call it skill, call it game, call it glow, call my name
Like the lord, all in vain, screamin' like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug, all up in ya vein 'cause—
(Wanna be good to you)

We make the squares dance, and get the dough like dosey
Y'all niggas roll with pussycats like Josie
All spoiled rotten like ghetto groceries, yo
I clutch the mic like ya grandma clutch her rosary, yo
Swoop in the industry, like a bird to prey
My stanzas got stamina, ya verses lack vertebrae
I heard them say I was a conscious rapper
But I'm a monster when I have to smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my hands solo and I don't need Chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis, yo
I write screen gems, y'all niggas act in B movies
Type of niggas proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd runnin' over the cliff
I'm the "Buffalo Soldier", smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowin' the spliff, loadin' a clip to spit high
Like you holdin' blow in a stolen whip, rolling the strip
Looking to hit cops, now that's a four alarm
Black queen fallin' on my arms, you could call it charm
Matter fact, call it what you want, it's up to you, bruh
(Wanna be good to you) Yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Call it skill, call it game, call it glow, call my name
Like the lord, all in vain, screamin' like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug, all up in ya vein 'cause—
(Wanna be good to you)

How many niggas ever been in love?
How many niggas really think they thugs?
And can't think without the drink and drugs
How many niggas can't get in with hats and sneakers on?
Say "Fuck security" and get inside and keep them on
How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong?
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eatin' on
That don't take heart, slave nigga, play ya part
I'd rather jump overboard, nigga, face the sharks
We stay doin' it, later for the conversation
Hammers is cocked and waitin', niggas is not debating
We ain't got the patience. You found poppin' shit
Come in to town just to run you down like poppa ditch
And dig a proper ditch, you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my house, you ain't no real Representative
I make it happen, you ain't official, you tentative
Niggas is sensitive, see how they catchin' feelings
It's so hot, the sweat rise and it wet the ceiling
Barracuda, Spitkicker nigga that's the crew (Wanna be good to you)
Call it skill, call it game, call it glow, call my name
Like the lord, all in vain, screamin' like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug, all up in ya vein 'cause—
(Wanna be good to you)

Woo (Come on)
Yeah
Well alright
Yo, yo, yo

Niggas be claiming shit, find a gangsta movie
Put they name in it, biting like there ain't no shame in it
You the hardest on the beat, I'm the fire that you playin' with
You a artist from the street, I'll give you the blood to paint it with
So yeah, I'm positive, I'm positive I'm the best
Spit bullets to split ya vest and deposit them in ya chest
Dark is the flesh on my bones, calling Brooklyn home
Hang up on niggas like '"I want you to meet my nigga tone", word
Leave me alone like Michael Jackson
Or there will be more than butterflies in your stomach
Waiting to see what happens
You see me out, know that my crew is flawless
So-called gangstas need more security than the Rawkus office
Yo, I thought you bust ya gun
You just a big joke, thinkin' you a Big Pun
Yo, Kanye, this is the big one (Wanna be good to you)
Me and my niggas havin' big fun

Ayo, my silent moments, loud as the crack of thunder
My hunger like the crocodile that attacks the hunter
It ain't commercial or underground, it's true 'cause I—
(Wanna be good to you)

Call it skill, call it game, call it glow, call my name
Like the lord, all in vain, screamin' like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug, all up in ya vein 'cause—
(Wanna be good to you)

Come on
BK and (Yeah)
BX and (Come on)
Q borough and (Yeah)
Manhattan and (Come on)
Harlem niggas and (Yeah)
Long Island (Yeah)
(Wanna be good to you)
The whole world rockin'
The whole world rockin'
I know them people watchin'
(Wanna be good to you)2Embed
