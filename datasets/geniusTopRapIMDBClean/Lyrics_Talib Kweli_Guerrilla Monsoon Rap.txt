Lets do it
Kanye West cmon turn me up and
Black Thought cmon turn me up and
Pharoahe Monch cmon turn me up and
Talib Kweli in the house with
Guerrilla Monsoon rap all the shorties like Who that
Got the whole crowd like How ya do that
Nigga you get smacked til ya blueblack
And ya crew give me dap like true that
We come through and all the shorties like Who that
Got the whole crowd like How ya do that
Nigga you get smacked til ya blueblack
And ya crew give me dap like true that  Yo 
I hit these emcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Aint a lot of ifs and ands its just straight talkin
Its hard to swallow at times so take portions
Bitin off more than you can chew create orphans
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin nails into they own coffins  Cmon 
Here come the Dundee moves rocketlaunchin  Yeah 
Black Thought quit playin him close and back up off him
Kweli spruce to the tree Bruce to the Lee
The real emcee that your favorite rapper used to be
One by one I knock em out like Schoolly D my rhymes a eulogy
A flea could move a tree before you think youre movin me
I black and blue emcees actin new to me get smacked stupidly
They lack skills like the Black community lack unity  Uh 
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz
Step off the stage to shouts of Kweli boomaiyay
See these four emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game change your whole sound
Nigga you gotta understand the plot to
Movin and groovin and always improvin a lot to
Ill outfox the average Porsche Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra  New York 
Slash ChiTown slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva you can get slapped silly


Guerrilla Monsoon rap all the shorties like Who that
Got the whole crowd like How ya do that
Nigga you get smacked til ya blueblack
And ya crew give me dap like true that
We come through and all the shorties like Who that
Got the whole crowd like How ya do that
Nigga you get smacked til ya blueblack
And ya crew give me dap like true that
Okay my sound drenches each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
Its truth or consequences ride with us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier or you a princess dog
Im in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf  Ha 
Nann nigga competition gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission hittin Pharoahe for help
From natives walkin the Trail of Tears to players sippin Belvedere
We always comin wellprepared and all my dogs smellin fear
Plus even my niggas from the Bay they say you hella scared  Uh 
Truth or consequences and all senses be wellaware  Woo 
Your style underdeveloped there hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see but I can tell by your stare
Nigga you fugazi sayin ya crew blazin
Like sayin Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican  Cmon 
Guerrilla Monsoon rap smell the fumes get in tune with it
When I attack your city yall gon think Dr Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seedspittin contests
With a vendetta that send a better letter bomb to Congress
Im pissed cumulus clouds are ominous
Words of the four the rawness thatll restore your calmness
Unless you wanna leave leg and armless
Thats parapaleg for those who believe in bomb threats
Guerrilla Monsoon rap all the shorties like Who that
Got the whole crowd like How ya do that
Nigga you get smacked til ya blueblack
And ya crew give me dap like true that
We come through and all the shorties like Who that
Got the whole crowd like How ya do that
Nigga you get smacked til ya blueblack
And ya crew give me dap like true that nigga
