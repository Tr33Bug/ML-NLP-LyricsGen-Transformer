I see ya Yeah I see ya
See Im lookin right at you I eyecontact you
You see me and Imma be me Uh
First Im sayin Hi then Im wavin Byebye
We get in we get in
Girl youre so fly youre so fly
Yo these swallows is horny as Charlie Parker
Be cutting em cause Im studying these birds like ornithology
Follow em when they tweeting holler instead of speaking
Give it a name she played the wicked games every weekend
Broke up with a dude for almost ending her life
Came over for the closure ended up spending the night
Got cozy in this apartment wine bottles started popping
Put scratches up on his back they questioning where he got them
Forgot it was her she Freddy her fingers was like machetes
The fucking was so steady she shredded him like confetti
Confronted him bout every single chick shes like enough already
I need to be with someone else this stuff is so petty
She was reacting to things he did in the past
This nigga was no saint he couldnt say no to ass
Her behavior so rash she gave up all her power
He put her out on the street nowhere to live nowhere to shower
How she gonna make it through the night
How shes so accepting of her station in life
She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Her fate is sealed cause she dependent on a man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
How she running the streets but still standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
Battery in the back popping up with the coppertop
Popular with the ass of the Hottentot
Niggas whooping and hollering at Andromeda when she passing the barber shop
Only job thats an option McDonalds or telemarketer
Hard for her making ends come together this aint the Beatles
She needing some anesthesia like she going under needles
She doing so much cutting its a wonder she bleeding
The money was so seductive no wonder she aint leaving
First time she felt like a woman was when a dude screamed
Nice ass out the car window driving past
Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream
They call her Rocky cause her makeup is like a mask
scars permanently lodged on her frontal lobe
Behind bars for credit card schemes she pulled a month ago
First she getting high now we waving byebye
Shes waiting out her station just the same
As shes waiting at the station late at night for a train that never came
