Take it to the top
Yea thats where we at with it hah
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character uh
Dont mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready Lets go
A wise man know what he know and what he doesnt
If hes not really sure what hes saying he dont discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective but his biblehood never questioned
A dying man will make a confession try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get posttraumatic stress disorder become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
Hell bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth
His word is his bond but his actions always the proof
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Lets go
Sometimes its hard to believe
In what you dont see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
Its hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open
Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down thunderstorm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce now Im back like Im Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday my twenties went in the bowl
Forgive me Lord for them bitches the night before
Business deals and the Bentleys I cant afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones on the gone it was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed therefore I spark
Recite the Quran Im in the dark
Devil knocking on my door he like a narc


Sometimes its hard to believe
In what you dont see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
Its hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open
No excuses if I start it then Ill see it through
God is what I see in you so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TVs true The media deceiving you
They misrepresenting misquoting then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing in case youre wondering
If they want the ring they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe but I back it up with what I know  oh 
Its the facts versus the facts simile your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments in Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire I walked through the Devils fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a beast with this rhyming
Thats where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
Lets go
Sometimes its hard to believe
In what you dont see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
Its hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open
Take it to the top take it to the top
Yeah yeah take it to the top take it to the top
Take it to the top take it to the top
