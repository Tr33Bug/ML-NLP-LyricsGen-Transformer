This the high life
Call it my life
This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove whats good my people I think we could
Get it you know we should hold it like its a grudge submerged
But I just surf
Im renting the universe
But the stars dont fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker
Moon raker sun scraper will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when Im on path
Flight without navigator plight of a savior
Now what would Jesus do
How you believe in Him You dont believe in you
The idea that you doubting Im unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride  inconthievable
These MCs is eatable wait  edible
Im fishing with dynamite now I got a freezer full
Of rappers bastards Im ten steps ahead of you
Incredible give credit where credit due
Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate generate power with my pen and pape
Stimulate you simulate you do what I incinerate
We do it for the dinner plates musical we innovate
You imitate your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they dont one quote and the hate just integrates


They feel us like shade you know were feeling great
Not a script that is writ this is how originals spit
Its an unconventional gift kwe we interpolate
Them others be herbin it the praise we deserving it
Word I love songs writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on Im putting the gloves on
I love horns Im loving this damn track
Im loving the hand clap its the clap clap
Loving it when you listen
Love will fix it said Ashford and Simpson  Thats right 
Living for the drums and the slums some of the best parts
The tourists never come they run when it gets dark
Yeah so in my idle space theyre funny like them bridal maids
Booking like were playing spades yeah we always make the grade
FSC to get a fade Valencia then to the Haight
Sucka free Im in my space say Im hella steezy yeah  yee 
Believe I get a so in streaking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores bike parking
Fly chicks sparking
Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping
Theres high life everywhere Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we living in Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this shawtys gon be speaking it
Oh they so uniquely spit
The great debater the saviour the caped crusader
The alpha the omega your favorite communicator
News junky Im debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty Im bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie theyre spinning it like a sufi
Rappers I dissect em collecting em like a souvie
Near theyre acting up Im directing em like a movie
Skip the drama this an actionadventure
They so freaking soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender
And yo do I really need to mention
This is the high life
High life high life
High life high life
Cause we be living the high life high life
High life high life
Yes Im living in the high life high life
High life high life
Cause Im living the high life high life
