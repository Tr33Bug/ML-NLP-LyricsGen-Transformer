Hostile Gospel Pt 1 Lyrics   Talib 
Deliver us deliver us  Yeah 
Deliver us deliver us  What Yeah 
And what the people say We wanna live it up
And what the people want Please deliver us
And what the people need Hey
I got that yeah
I call these rappers baby seals cause they club you to death
I could call em Navy SEALs cause they government feds
What become of the vets They drugged up they fucked up they in debt
There aint no love and no respect its like a gang its like a club or a set
HipHops the new WWF
What do you rap or do you wrestle Niggas love to forget
We got til its gone you think you on you still hustlin backwards
Your topical norm a tropical storm its a fuckin disaster
Back to the topic we on it all started at Rawkus
They couldnt find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts
Is he a backpacker Is he a mad rapper
An entertainer or the author of the last chapter
We living in these times of love and cholera
Synonymous with the apocalypse look up the clouds is ominous
We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists shit
We still waitin for the Congress to acknowledge this
singers in the background 
What the people want Please deliver us
We wanna live it up please deliver us
Thththis is the thththis is the this is the hostile gospel
Im reaching through the fire  please deliver us
Im preaching to the choir  please deliver us
Just keep it real with us you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow we need someone to follow
You aint promised tomorrow so get your paper up
You cant always just borrow and asks for favors bruh
Stand on your own two never covet thy neighbors stuff
Karmas a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin bruh
I start a conversation based on general observation
HipHop is not a nation take it to population
Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan
Awaitin trial debatin how the hell I got placed in this system
Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow itll leave you scarred tomorrow
Keep it honest our motto these niggas keep it bottled
Im the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus DAmato
DJs stickin to vinyl like Fuck Serato
Suppliers who ride around the block in the custom autos
Ballin like the struck the lotto you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it reeich with the stitch and greedy geniuses
Im not a hipster but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes cause they snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth
You cant trust a soul in the biz so be careful who you eatin with
And sleepin with and also who you chiefin with
You never know they mightve added in secret ingredients


What the people want Please deliver us
We wanna live it up please deliver us
Thththis is the thththis is the this is the hostile gospel
Im reaching through the fire  please deliver us
Im preaching to the choir  please deliver us
Just keep it real with us you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow we need someone to follow
Freedoms a road thats seldom traveled watch hell unravel
Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle
The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water
And not take the hand of every man who make a offer
To black kids wishin they white kids when they close they eyelids
Like I bet they neighborhood aint like this
White kids wishin they black kids and wanna talk like rappers
Its all backwards its identity crisis
The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us
Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin makin narcotics outta household products
We aint workin out til we exorcise the demons thats inside us
Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves
Enough dope to slang ourselves enough toast to bang ourselves
Its officially nigga season these niggas is bleedin
Thats why Im spittin freedom we had enough of trigger squeezin
What the people want Please deliver us
We wanna live it up please deliver us
Thththis is the thththis is the this is the hostile gospel
Im reaching through the fire  please deliver us
Im preaching to the choir  please deliver us
Just keep it real with us you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow we need someone to follow
In these tryin days and times
All I need is to be free
I cant do it on my own
Lord can you deliver me
There are trials still to come
Its salvation that I need
So Im reachin to the sky
Lord can you deliver me
Deliver us
Deliver us yeah
Deliver us ohhhhhhhhhh
Oh deliver us
Deliver us
Ohhhhh Deliver us yes
Deliver us deliver us deliver us
Yeah yeah yeah ohhhhhhhhhh ad libs to fade
