I exhibit characteristics of the average misfit
Who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit
Its sick and tragic how antagonistic we get
When theres no power it go sour
I seen em crossing a bridge by the masses
Covered in the ashes of both towers
Native New Yorker the way that we talk
Make him an offer that you cant refuse
Come back later on after you thought it over
Look out for shooters that were popping up at the opera
To pop ya daughters paying for the sins of the god father
Popular music got em confusing killers and artists
I kill it the hardest Competition dearly departed
They feeling some sort of way cuz my flow revealing the garbage
Im making em throw it up You just making the people vomit
When it comes to this rhymin Im a legend like Tutankhamun
Or the Chupacabra the way I weave it together and tie the knot up
Made a macram of macabre you daquiri with a shot of
The Amarretta youre sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back cognac Im the best you know that
You can have your own opinion but not your own facts
On track as the most prolific ever the most consistently
Viciously off the rip we be rippin it like a shredder
Some symphony hall shit gettin higher than your falsetto
Getting better Drop a pearl every jam like Eddie Vedder
Very fed up with self appointed preservers of past eras
Who never see their reflection when theyre walking past mirrors
They got bitten and now they smitten with the taste of blood
They take enough drugs for the sleepin they weepin and fuckin they makeup up
I raise the bar and the waiters up
All this hate is just confused unadulterated love
The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
Advocate for artists regardless cause I got faith in us
For the workers who dont get paid enough
Take the bus hands way too rough for the paper cuts
As far as theyre concerned food on the tables the only way to love
It takes a slum village to raise a child you got to raise it up
Raise it up raise it upraise it up take it up take it up
