Yeah
New Talib Kweli
You know what it is
Cmon
I try I try
I try you know I try
I try I try
I try  K West Kweli  you know I try
Get searched on the plane Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life kiss of death my lips pursed the same
You flirt til she came
Nothin hurt like the pain and torture
Daughters of the dust lookin for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lords name
Put your hands together got em all sayin
I try I try
I try you know I try
I try I try
I try you know I try  Yo 
Its all ghetto in gear higher than falsetto
More metal for beef that we dont let the law settle
I try to navigate the treacherous waters of
Americas ghettos that set up to slaughter us
But theres more of us  Yeah 
Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous trigger stranglers
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit
Our growing pains get way deeper than Mike Seavers
Our uniforms is white sneakers and white Tshirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The hood need us but rappers just aint the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry but you cant stop the music
An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair  Upside down kingdom 
So many sufferin cause deep inside theyre scared  So scared 
Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I dont care
I try
I try you know I try
I try I try
I try you know I try  Yo 
The things Im seein on the news is insane
A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front the train
A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
Two years old eatin ketchup and mustard cryin for help
Tryin to bring your struggle to life
The label want a song about a bubbly life
I have trouble tryin to write some shit to bang in the club through the night
When people suffer tonight
Lord knows I try
I try I try
I try you know I try
I try I try
I try you know I try
Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin the noodle some people usin the muscle
Some people put it all together make it fit like a puzzle
Come on say it now
Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin the noodle some people usin the muscle
Some people put it all together yeah
I try
I try you know I try
I try Lord knows I try
Every day I I
Lalala lala lala lalala lala
Upside down kingdom

Every day on the news we cant look around without
Something somewhere

I try I try I try you know I try
Lord knows Lord knows we try try
