You left me
Yes Welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Left me in a low
Ladies
I got you in the mood  Yeah  for a interlude
Raw like in the nude I hope this aint considered rude
But lets stop talking cause its feelin like an interview
I know youre into me so let me get into you
Im always in the mood for laughing and loving
And rapping and fucking
And passing the dutch and relaxing and puffing
And hitting and ducking the ripping production
These kittens aint muffins just because we stuff em in the oven
My words is dripping off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap they cant handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks
Dude get a clue like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holding hands with these dudes like they going steady but
One glimpse and I know they readyyou already know
Slipped her a note like You ready to go
We make a getaway plan and we head for the door lets go
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars  Cmon 
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are who we is its the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right we gon do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars  YYYeah yeah 
Navigate through the truly bizarre  Yeezy uhuh 
Who we are who we is its the kids that stay true to this life  Uhuh 
And if the mood is right we gon do it tonight  Woo 
You messin up my mo my whole mood told you oh
Lose eat crews like soul food
The only producer that feel like Fuck rappers
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Only Michael Richardson only much Blacker
So if he say nigga then Ima say
Is this a Ritz Carlton Dress like fresh like
Just like Im the shit  In the mood 
Ugh You aint figured out what Im about yet
Always rockin that Thisaintoutyet
But this aint bout that
From a city where niggas plug like outlets
Far as music go yo it aint no outlets
So when I go out niggas always out to get me in the studio
And I aint in the mood to flow
Im with my girl and Im tryin to hit the movies yo
And they tryna act stupidoh
In the club with Silicon Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy
With real titties like Tootie
This girl got a silicon booty
And got the nerve to act moody
Now I aint tryna judge like Judy
But bitch you a man you cant fool me
Act like 50throw her in a pool G


I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars  Yeah 
Navigate through the truly bizarre  Uhuh uh uh 
Who we are who we is its the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right we gon do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are who we is its the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right we gon do it tonight
Break it down uh
What
Ahah uh uhuh ah
Ahah uh uhuh ah
Yeah
DDDDDDnnwha
DDDDDDnnwha
Bringin the drum keep it funky like a stink in a slum
Cause see they wanna breed cursing for the things that dont come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmastime choice for what No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You aint got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes dont compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for my people see how deep it can run
Im in the mood like Donte and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow got its change yo
Its strange yo to make yo chain glow thats yo main goal
Thats a facade like Im somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes Mr Bojanglesass dudes
Dancin around the club doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are who we is its the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right we gon do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are who we is its the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right we gon do it tonight
Wow thats a nice track
