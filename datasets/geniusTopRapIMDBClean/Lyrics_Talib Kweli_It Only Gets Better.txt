Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better better
It only gets better from here
Bridge 1Talib Kweli 
Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops hit the booth spit  at you spit it great
Practicing my gratitude life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude just because

Verse 1 Talib Kweli 
Every day I gotta
Trust in God and hustle hard
My grind is real my hustle dope
Im finding meals Im signing deals
Im the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah you know its real but Im focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause youre not in tune no youre not immune
No Echinacea no golden seal
So you sick inside gotta flush it down
When you talk to folks cover your mouth
Aint nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work you tuff it down
You bust it out till youre out for work
I know your boss a jerk youre gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver uppercut
That clock only thing you punchin out
I relate to you you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what youre made to do
I got faith in you youre gonna make it through
Cause you dont chase money money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a baby due
You wont taste no fruits like Naked Juice
Wo The world wont wait for you you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vow
As long as you on planet earth put family first got to make em proud
Hey let me break it down oh bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are

Bridge 2  Marsha Ambrosius 
Every day I got to get up early wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day Im hustling
Fight the traffic lose my cool
Get the kids up at the school
Life its hard yeah thats true
This is what I have to do

Verse 2 Talib Kweli 
Walk with God be still and listen
Try to talk to God whats real Im spitting
Call em Christ by name but he still aint rising
Set to my lane but still aint listening
Got ice in the veins remain so frigid
Still in the kill brain cells when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that pop that pop that
Dont stop get it get it
Started we the fighters we survivors but we aint living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving
People of colour 25 more likely than whites to face prison
But just because the president is black theres no more racism
Postracial More like most racial
The hate for you disgraceful
Dont let it take you off your base let it motivate you
Dont let it overtake you so what another cloud
Survive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild
Wow

Memories live man and my memories stay alive
