Je Dois Partir Lyrics
Oh yeah
That’s the universal language right there
The have nots, vs the have

Growing up, sure was tough
When the money, getting to slowing up
A promise is hard as trying to do to knowledge
When you don’t know enough
Poor enough to notice
But you pour it up, and you throw it up
They say that when they comin'
But we ain't runnin', nobody as cold as us
My life is like a play
But I don’t grace stages
Try to feed my family, but it’s hard on these slave wages
Lucifer behind me, crucify me like a god suh
They never want to pay us, but immigrants get the job done
Job one is self-preservation
I gotta stay healthy
The system always favors the riches, make sure they stay wealthy
How they gon' stop it, if education for profit
The prophets make revelations
The gangsters go in your pockets
I’m stocking up on these favors, cause vagrancy never fly
They value people for they paper
Like animals for they hides
And the battle cry, is that there’s value in our lives
Spirituality over money is where our power lies
Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moi

The attitude they employ say it all
It’s just aristocratic
Fascist police’ll murder people who give em static
They’ll make a cheap version of smack
And sell that shit to addicts
Systematic or incidental that shit is just as tragic
I’m just emphatically and dramatically overwhelmed fam
No job, no money, no safety net, no health plan
No car, no home, no food on the table
No way to provide for my people
Though I’m willing and able to
To pry off government assistance
Cause a feeling’ll enable you
Where pride ain't practical when you lacking that capital
Holes in my clothes, this was never a fashion show
Too broke for the sour roll
But that don’t matter though
Talk is cheap, I had enough of the back and forth
I’m on the verge, snapping out
Trying to laugh it off
I love to work for myself
‘Cause it sucks when you have a boss
But I least I have a job, no one is promised to have it all
I’m in the rat race; pick up the phone when the cattle call
Spitting these tree songs, keep calm like Adderall
You might also like
Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moiEmbed
