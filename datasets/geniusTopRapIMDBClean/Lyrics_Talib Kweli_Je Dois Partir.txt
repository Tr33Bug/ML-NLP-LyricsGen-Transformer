Oh yeah
Thats the universal language right there
The have nots vs the have
Growing up sure was tough
When the money getting to slowing up
A promise is hard as trying to do to knowledge
When you dont know enough
Poor enough to notice
But you pour it up and you throw it up
They say that when they comin
But we aint runnin nobody as cold as us
My life is like a play
But I dont grace stages
Try to feed my family but its hard on these slave wages
Lucifer behind me crucify me like a god suh
They never want to pay us but immigrants get the job done
Job one is selfpreservation
I gotta stay healthy
The system always favors the riches make sure they stay wealthy
How they gon stop it if education for profit
The prophets make revelations
The gangsters go in your pockets
Im stocking up on these favors cause vagrancy never fly
They value people for they paper
Like animals for they hides
And the battle cry is that theres value in our lives
Spirituality over money is where our power lies
Mon cur je dois partir
Je sais cest difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne ten fais pas pour moi
Jallumerai chaque soir
Des toiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientt l
Reste ici attendsmoi
The attitude they employ say it all
Its just aristocratic
Fascist policell murder people who give em static
Theyll make a cheap version of smack
And sell that shit to addicts
Systematic or incidental that shit is just as tragic
Im just emphatically and dramatically overwhelmed fam
No job no money no safety net no health plan
No car no home no food on the table
No way to provide for my people
Though Im willing and able to
To pry off government assistance
Cause a feelingll enable you
Where pride aint practical when you lacking that capital
Holes in my clothes this was never a fashion show
Too broke for the sour roll
But that dont matter though
Talk is cheap I had enough of the back and forth
Im on the verge snapping out
Trying to laugh it off
I love to work for myself
Cause it sucks when you have a boss
But I least I have a job no one is promised to have it all
Im in the rat race pick up the phone when the cattle call
Spitting these tree songs keep calm like Adderall


Mon cur je dois partir
Je sais cest difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne ten fais pas pour moi
Jallumerai chaque soir
Des toiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientt l
Reste ici attendsmoi
