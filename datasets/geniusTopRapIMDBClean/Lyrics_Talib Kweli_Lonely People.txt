All the lonely people
Yeah I like to go out to clubs  Hey hey 
Where do they all come from
Las Palmas you know
She this envy if I wanna get grimey wit it at Bungalow Eight  Hey hey 
All the lonely people
Opium down in Miami  Yeahah yeahah 
Where do they all belong
But when I walk in I look around and I think
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Heyyeahyeah
I look at all the lonely people  Ooh 
Yo Im headin out bout to do some fleshin out
I know my flesh endowed
With somethin to prove Im settin out
On a trip to Heavens mouth yeah
Im steppin out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mamas all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin and they love shoppin and they thug posturin
Thugs be lockin horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the hood
When you tryin to make paper out of the wood
You know that money dont grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin
He snitchin he twitchin he bitchin he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs gotta be in the club
Lookin for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he dont like the way he been livin
And he wanna be forgiven
How I know Cause Im right there wit him yo yo


All the lonely people  Yeahahah 
Where do they all come from  Ohoh ohoh 
All the lonely people  All the lonely people 
Where do they all belong  OhhohhI 
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Oh I look at all
Tattoos tell em who you are
Plastic Surgery coup detat the God
Uh lasers to remove the scar
And then you are you a supastar supastar
Its your birthday and you in the club
Talkin Holla back and Nigga what
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really truth is that nobody there
Cause its feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas trees
God complex like they born on Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet left your man at home
Security snatchin people camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend thats so last year
Last month last day last hour last minute
Your pursuit of cool is so passionate
Doin for the cash in it laugh in his face
If its def or anybody who dont stay in his place
So popular cant go nowhere folks stoppin ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you went into a room the heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely
Thats why you need disguises well probably
All the lonely people  Ooh people
