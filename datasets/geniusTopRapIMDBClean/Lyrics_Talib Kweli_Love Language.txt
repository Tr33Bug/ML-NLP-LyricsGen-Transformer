 Intro Talib Kweli 
Yo were going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So whenever you hear the word love
Know that its going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated yo
Verse 1 Talib Kweli 
Love is blind you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin the night life lookin for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic then got to frantic
Then things thats normally small become gigantic
Now yall sinkin like the Titanic here come the panic
Being with you like a habit without you I cant stand it
Its tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin a nut off communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned on wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We dont smile anymore and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo see what Im sayin
Its like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife bitches say niggas is
We just dont understand our fundamental differences
Im still learning though actually
I just do what come naturally naturally naturally
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere  Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es  Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe  I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve  And I found you 
Verse 2 Talib Kweli 
Women thrive on emotions men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say word
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo wherever you want to go lovell take you there
Lets go you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun thats where Im comin from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin over drums
Word  te quiero  I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart youre livin in your ocean Im swimmin in
Never drowning got me floatin watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin approachin
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust Ill always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out Ill show you how it could be
Love different language it aint nuttin but a word
A chicken aint nuttin but a bird
Yo yo yo

 Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere  Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es  Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe  I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve  And I found you 
Verse 3 Talib Kweli 
Some of yall in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal thats why Im feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
Thats what your beauty remind me of
Its hard to find a love like ours taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and thats a different thing
Anything but Queen Ill go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you aint got a band
But they dont understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they aint privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language they speak from pain and anguish
Some dont love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like Shit he payin for your rent missin the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
Its more than pillow talk it cant be translated
Learn how to speak it and become emancipated
Its a language
Universal love
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere  Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es  Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe  I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve  And I found you 
Love love love love love love  Repeated
