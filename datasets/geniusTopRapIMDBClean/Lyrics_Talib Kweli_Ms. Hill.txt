Ms Hill Lyrics
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Ms Hill you got skills thats a gift its real
Get ill what you spit got the power to uplift the heel
I wish I could talk to Lauryn
I mean excuse me Ms Hill
And let her know how much we love her is real
The industry was beating her up
Then those demons started eating her up
She need a savior thatll bleed in a cup yup
We used to kick it in the salad days
When she look at me like she aint know me when she see me nowadays
I nod she nod back thats how it stay
Her songs still better than anything out than Hot or Power play
Remember how they accused her of saying he did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing and tell the Pope about herself
Just after she left the Fugees started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelles Block Party
She made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful
Took Black Star on tour in Europe I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but Im sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower the main characters name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls selfesteem was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She aint healthy Im a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load but no
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Ms Hill you got skills thats a gift its real
Get ill what you spit got the power to uplift the heel
Got your assistant on the the phone I need to talk to Lauryn
And I wanna walk through the storm and I could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
Please this no disrespect to whoever your man is though
This relationship is strictly music like DAngelo
I know you hate Babylon and wanna see it fall
But they wont let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope you give us faith you the one
They dont like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come whoa
Now thats powerful sis its black power
We get money keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I aint saying you Christ that would be sacrilegious right
But you can blow and you nice sisters them raps is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devils last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read Francis Crest or anything
By Third World Press impressed
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Donda West yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it cause I really aint got the words to say it
But yo
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Ms Hill you got skills thats a gift its real
Get ill what you spit got the power to uplift the heel
