I know theres a first time for everything
First time I let her in my bed she got wetter then the perfect storm
That we weathering together and
This the first time that Ive ever considered wedding rings
But first things first yo
I met her at the bar rolling with three wise men like I followed the star
There she is shorty bi coastal
Thick like bifocals stacked like 2Pac vocals her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so Im romancing the stone
The rhythm is to the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest and Ill fly make you testify
Damn baby I know we got some haters and
I dont care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I used to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this aint what Im used to seeing
Because I never been in love before
You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the beautiful struggle
Now baby tell whats it gonna take to prove that I love you
When Im gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening to
Dont get it confused Im trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this its like a miracle you
You You stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I took above its clear skies thats surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and Im down to serve lets deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo
Here we go
I dont care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I used to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this aint what Im used to seeing
Because I never been in love before
You looked good when I tried you on
So I had to write a song
Use to be the guy that always made her cry when Im gone
Always kept a stable and I never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone why
Im never home scared of commitment
Ready to forever roam
We at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to RIP Proceeds my name up on the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes
Dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them do you I dont care who she speaking with
Because I already know she made it clear who she leaving with
And it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you aint no groupie ho
Sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something that you should know
I know we got some haters and
I dont care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I used to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this aint what Im used to seeing
Because I never been in love before
I know we got some haters and
I dont care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I used to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this aint what Im used to seeing
Because I never been in love before
I know we got some haters and
I dont care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I used to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this aint what Im used to seeing
Because I never been in love before
