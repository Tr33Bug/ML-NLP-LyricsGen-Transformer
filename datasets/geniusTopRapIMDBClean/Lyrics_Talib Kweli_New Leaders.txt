New Leaders Lyrics
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (status for life)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (yeah)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (hey, hey)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (yeah)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (come out)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (uh, ay, ay)

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back
Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you "gay"
Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more, some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through a door, I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it, like it was pottery or
The mouth with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor, I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore, so they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door
To top it all off, if your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce
That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all, I done forgot what I'm following for
Enough about y'all, now back to me, ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece, so when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (yeah), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders

Oh lord
Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen
To rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus, though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath, what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught, I look at myself and pretend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?
If you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga

Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap for me uh (put your hands together)
Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap, now bring it back
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (catch up)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah, catch up)
Got enough followers (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers (what), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself forward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of mother's unlimited figurative tree
Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming, catch up with us cause we leaving
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
