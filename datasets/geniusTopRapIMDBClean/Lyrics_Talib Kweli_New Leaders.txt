Welcome to the new age where theyre thirsty for that KoolAid
Thirsty for first in that page really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say trying to diss you calling you gay
Such an urgent need to express yourself but really nothing to say
Dont fuck with us we too tough get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out Im chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club I know you dont give a fuck
You told me what you dont like you made that clear now what do you love
Theres gotta be more some live the life of the rich some people gotta be poor
Ive been through a door I will not sell you a dream thats what the lottery for
The music is clay I shaped it I molded it like it was pottery or
The mouth with the law twist it like Robert Duvall son the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore so they burning with shaman Im popping the door
To top it all off if your style is married to substance you sound like you got a divorce
Thats why Im blocking and unfollowing yall I done forgot what Im following for
Enough about yall now back to me aint no academic leave Im not faculty
These new slaves aint ready for my masterpiece so when they hear me rap its catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I dont actually wish anybody harm now stretch your arms and clap for me
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap now bring it back

Oh lord
Ever since the day I was born that marks the day I was chosen
To rise above them all and be a leader Im like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream Rosa Parks on the bus though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame aint shit gon change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard thats why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true I gave you my oath what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught I look at myself and pretend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone whats left for the believers
If you looking for the truth one word Underachievers nigga
Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap for me uh  put your hands together 
Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap now bring it back

As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself forward from the darkness into the light
I take flight its goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of mothers unlimited figurative tree
Of life I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwins beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul Im blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now Im truly livin  bless up bless up 
And now Im truly livin  bless up bless up 
Wake up cause no youre not dreaming catch up with us cause we leaving
Got enough followers Im looking for some new leaders
Im looking for some new leaders  ay  Im looking for some new leaders  uh 
Got enough followers Im looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no youre not dreaming  no  catch up with us cause we leaving  yeah 
Got enough followers Im looking for some new leaders  ay 
Im looking for some new leaders  ay  Im looking for some new leaders  ay 
Got enough followers Im looking for some new leaders  ay
