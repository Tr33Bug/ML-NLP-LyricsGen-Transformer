I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the suns rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
Its darkest before light
Im gonna push through
Turbocharged bars
Slot cars on tracks falling off game scars in these rap wars
Aint nothing bandaids wont cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands two buses my own cash
No budget no major label fundings Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You cant say nothing you under gag order
Hopping out of Audis hurting yall with kicks Im the Transporter
Think about it never mind you aint gotta
Im already on some whole other word to yo mufuckin self
Nobody else gon do it for ya nobody else
Every now and then someonell offer ya help but they aint doing nothing
Til they really see you tryna do something I aint bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the suns rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
Its darkest before light
Im gonna push through
When you a man action is whats expected nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses gotta go beyond
My flow is tomfoolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe thats free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
Its coonery its lunacy lets make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When Im on fire she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements never join em so you gotta beat em
Its carpe diem hey  hey  yeah
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the suns rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
Its darkest before light
Im gonna push through
Like kindergarteners
My visions bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starvingll speed on ya stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending established with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent ready to crash in
to society take this driver seat hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice when I rolled them dice I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve relax
Thats what my mental say but my physicals been detached
Im on some other shit like fuck the government
Im higher rankings wheres the mothership
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted where the fuck you been
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations that sensations insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress nigga which one you indulging
Regardless of who you pick know lifes a bitch when you aint focused nigga
Im focused
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the suns rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
Its darkest before light
Im gonna push through
