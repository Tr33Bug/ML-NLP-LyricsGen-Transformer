Moving at the speed of a solution
Bleeding in the streets as were breathing the pollution
Theyre saying that we need a revolution
But their passion is reduced to allcaps on a computer
Hey every sixteen I make a sick scene
Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen
Yall niggas trippin like mescaline and mixed greens
My flow cleaner than the Sistine pristine
You going green like Al Gore with em
I make algorithms that got Malcolm in em
Gods favorite Im sick as a doctors patient
We live in a cold world my job is to rock nations
My occupation Elation a celebration of rebels
Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant
Its too amazing how we be blazing son
Our flowers is the loudest they crowd around us
But cower in the shadows of the towers boy
Take a tour with it bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That its knuckles gon scrape the floor
Make a call all the rocket ships taking off
Jah Wu gun music playin when we facing off
Yo I plaster the nation causing evacuation
My manifestation got em patient from how I keeps it amazing
See Im the reason niggas need some training
While Im inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion
Im very engaging soon as Im awaken
Quickly back you up and bag your bitch
Shes reminding me of Sanaa Lathan
Rely on the hating while Im smiling and waiting
Thats when I embrace em
If you try to front youll be highly mistaken
The mightiest making of a classic alrighty Ill face it
My psyche is ancient and Im hiring so try me Im patient
Sorry Im lying face it Im back for the taking
Im urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in
Damn can you cut his mic off 
See how we got em buggin
Cause they cant believe what we have in the making
Shit so historic got me goin for it while I bang the nation
And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon
Bitch you still cooking this pork in this house
Stop cooking that damn pork in this house
The hell going on in here
Take a tour with it bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That its knuckles gon scrape the floor
Make a call all the rocket ships taking off
Jah Wu gun music playin when we facing off
These rap niggas is bitches nothing but suckers to me
Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me
Your weak product is nothing to me
I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis
Yep I get buck in the studio like Im Evil Dee
Pulling strings like the Muppet movie
Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi
Whos the hottest regardless of whos flaming
We aint talkin bout the best until you mention my name
Whore you kidding The truest spitting
Ill break you like a mirror so its clearer
That we dont believe in superstition
These new additions need supervision
Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me
What are you stupid Listen
Ive been official its been official Im too consistent
I make a claim cause Im too official for euphemisms
Staying in the cut like a new incision
Ill put you on your ass like True Religion
So give it up for the truest living
Take a tour with it bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That its knuckles gon scrape the floor
Make a call all the rocket ships taking off
Jah Wu gun music playin when we facing off
