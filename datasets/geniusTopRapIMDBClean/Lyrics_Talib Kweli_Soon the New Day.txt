And natures game once more begins
Here we go like yes yes yall
To the beat yall
Aint no sleep yall
To the break of dawn
Five oclock in the morning
We keep rockin on
The workin people runnin like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin in the meat market
Chicks take a seat park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like its heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get er done
That ole hit n run
Turn em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Aint nothin like wakin up with a stranger in your bed nope
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today
Its all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but cant take away the frown
Found under the makeup
I asked her whats your passion
Answered whats the paper
She sleepin and they dont want her to wake up
Maybe then shell realize her own beauty
Baby you a star and not just a star on some dudes home movies
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn


Steppin out I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
Im slippin in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree now we hang behind the rope we VIP
We do it BIG
Aint no need to see ID
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off dont need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the skys fallin
Like you Chicken Little come on
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
