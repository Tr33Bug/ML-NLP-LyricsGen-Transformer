Gotta celebrate life
Pay tribute
Celebrate and commemorate
Yeah
At the crib we listen to Madlib
HiTek Dilla beat tapes and thats it
Supreme alchemy refined chemistry divine energy
We defined by our memories
On them days that I wish they took me instead of Beverly
I remember Rapsody reminded m that lifes ahead of me
I drop thm non sequiturs to bomb executives
Youll always be the winner if you decide what the metric is
Control the game dont be the game or the predator
Me Myself and I such a formidable competitor
Descendant of a king I got Negus in my bloodline
A true king is fighting with the soldiers on the front line
When its crunch time sometimes his words can be unkind
Handing and marching orders like Im Dr Lee in Drumline
One band one sound when we combine
Most rappers just a joke its all setups and punchlines
I couched it in a verse its about as comfy as the confines
Of a prison cell where living well is a small ray of sunshine
Supreme alchemy that aint what the reverend say
I never hesitate to show compassion cause thats the key to Heavens gates
To reach it they selfmedicate the voices on my radio active like yellowcake
But hella fake why sedate when you can meditate and focus on ideas cause police you cant legislate
Or regulate always on time my faith is never late
So before every meal the proper said his grace
Celebrate we pay tribute and commemorate
When you know your selfworth you give thanks for your fellow greats
Celebrate escaping from the industry to get away
Seen the same kind of fate that turned Dumile to Metal Face
Celebrate when you slow down we accelerate
So many cautionary tales I need some yellow tape
Celebrate we elevate and we innovate
Diversify way more than your bonds we dont assimilate
