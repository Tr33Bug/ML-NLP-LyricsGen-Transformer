Talk to You  Lil Darlin  Lyrics
Let me holler at you for a minute
Yeah
Can I talk to you  Can I talk to you  uh
Can I talk to you  You  Yeah
Can I talk to you Can I talk to you 
For a minute yeah  Oh you 
Can I talk to you  Can I talk to you 
Can I talk to you Yeah uh  You you 
Can I talk to you
Can I talk to you 
Yeah you you
I want you cause you make my heart skip the beat that I drum to
I want to be the one you run to when the pain confronts you
Youre everything sometimes I get nervous when Im in front you
You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do Id practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you black out and collapse I want to help you to come to
Notice I havent yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
Youre everything send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet musicll start I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart we gotta work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list what I want not what I need theres a difference
These days Im learnin that words got power so Ima be specific
Word
Can I have a talk with you
Can I make a dream come true
Can I be in love with you
Cause I would  I would  if I could  Yeah 
Oh  Yeah baby can I 


Yeah sunflower
You must live in that infinite black that exists when I close my eyes
I see you when I fall asleep I see you when I dream
