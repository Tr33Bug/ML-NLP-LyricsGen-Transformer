We survive  June 11 2001 
Its more than pride  Timothy McVeigh is executed 
We stay alive  And the country breathes a sigh of relief 
Ready to ride  Goodness prevails over evil it seems 
We survive its more than pride  Somehow with him gone 
We stay alive  We feel safer 
Ready to ride  Little do we know 
Today the paper say Timothy McVeighs in hell
So everythings okay and all must be well
I remember in Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing on the front page
Its like saying only gays get AIDS propaganda
Like saying the problems over when they locked that man up
Wrong its just the beginning the first inning
Battle for Americas soul the devils winning
The president is Bush the vice presidents a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon get
They dont wanna raise the babies so the election is fixed
Thats why we dont be fucking with politics
They bet on that parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down bit by dogs and got Blacks into house arrest for that
Its all good except for that we still poor
And money power respect is what we kill for for real
Its more than pride
We stay alive ready to ride
We survive its more than pride  Yeah 
We stay alive ready to ride
We survive  August 4 2001 
Its more than pride  A drunken police officer 
We stay alive  Mows down an entire family in Brooklyn 
Ready to ride  The judge lets him go with no bail 
We survive  It reminds us 
Its more than pride  Just how worthless our lives are to the justice system 
We stay alive  I struggle 
Ready to ride  To explain the situation to my son its hard 


Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal but what the fuck do I tell my son
I want him living right living good respect the rules
Hes five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
Hell be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
Its in they job description to terminate the threat
So fortyone shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set dont matter you he follow the law
I know Ill give my son pride and make him swallow it all  Damn 
Fuck the pigs I think the pigs killed Big and Pac too
If they didnt they know who did they got to
Who they serve and protect Nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten Gs but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors so they workin for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back wont face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cops wife
Cops kill my people every day thats life
We survive its more than pride
We stay alive ready to ride  Yeah 
We survive its more than pride
We stay alive ready to ride
We survive  September 11 2001 
Its more than pride  Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center 
We stay alive  It kills thousands and permanently scars Americas false sense of security 
Ready to ride
We survive  We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst 
Its more than pride  As firefighters police officers 
We stay alive  Rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts fight to save lives 
Ready to ride  The world will never be the same again 
My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red Black yellow white and brown heroes
Its more complicated than Black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But its hard for me to walk down the block
Seein rats and roaches crack files and fortyounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
Its a hard conversation to have
We lost kids moms and dads people ready to fight for the flag
Damn when did shit get this bad
America kill the innocent too the cycle of violence is sad damn
Welcome to the world we here
Weve been at war for years but its much more clear  Yeah 
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and ride for the dead
We survive  Yeah  its more than pride  Much more 
We stay alive  Uh  ready to ride  Lets go 
We survive  Thats right  its more than pride  Much more 
We stay alive ready to ride  Lets go 
We survive  Yeah  its more than pride
We stay alive ready to ride
We survive
