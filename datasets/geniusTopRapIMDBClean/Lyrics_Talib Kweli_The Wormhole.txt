Oh you niggas wanna get deep
Niggas wanna kick knowledge Yall niggas aint deep man
Yall niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then Im like show me the proof right
Niggas start talking about the antiChrist and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga
Im a grown ass man Lets go lets go
You can lead a man to a drink but you cant make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link but that dont mean he gonn click
Whats this Yall aint really on no deep shit I peeped it
Scared of a motherfuckin secret society
And only bein with people you agree with you scared of a
Chalice scared of death only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up no new Bugatti  Yes 
My enemy tryna stop me
But I dont stand a chance if I cant identify em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state and they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets they was Scholars early Illuminati was
Sorta like the students in Victor Hugos Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss em turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration  Keep it goin 
And aint no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
Thats how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof show em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact aint no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real lifes more complex whats your context
They put the symbols on the dollar bill the monument the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
Its really just another case of stealin from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh
Population control is real  word  you know the deal but still
Perpetuate the cycle of violence we known to hold the steel
No I dont need no fuckin chorus
Used to read so many books thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really dont know what you reading if you really dont know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and thats a fact
Dont get caught in the distraction its bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed aint got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister worse than any blood sacrifice
You can imagine iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food vaccines humanitarian aid
They want control of the region they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Wheres the conspiracy Its always been the plan
Yall niggas scared of one world currency but still paying your
Taxes it aint the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of your enemy
Im leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat


Man we supposed to be brothas 
Oh what you tryna get smart
Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge
Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
Take that shit off
Beeping
