I come from the God body era
I come from standing on street corners
Smoking blunts out of white owls with 40s
Building and destroying about the suns
And the planets and the moons and the stars
About the nature of man
About knowledge wisdom and understanding
And you had to show and prove
And you had to be right and exact
Voulezvous rendezvous coucou le poopoo come on
Yeah Chris yeah I like that right there yeah
Hah come on Yeah
KAYTRANADA classic
Waste these niggas son I got a doctorate in rockin it
Pardon we got it poppin its marvelous nigga watch it
You follow a carbon copies Im stoppin to intervene
Youre erroneous these the phoniest rappers Ive ever seen
When I take flight Im traveling light thats a double entendre
For when Im touring exploring outside the genre
Illuminate when I grabbin the mic its so bright itll blind you
Yeah Im back with a friendly reminder
Were two ships thatre passing in the night but alas
You got to run into the iceberg Im cracking this shit in half
Traveling light not talking about back of the back
First I get back in the lab then I hit the road Ill be back in a flash
Im Barry Allen mixed with Harry Allen
My blood hot as volcanic rock forming canary diamonds they find on Canary Islands
My rhymes inspired by enviroments of the very violent
Im the voice of a generation thats very silent
I stick to my convictions like Ive been indicted
All you niggas throwing me shade you about to get enlightened


Travel light travel light
Traveling light travel light
You grinding til the sun up
Whether its cold murder the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die so
Brooklyn is changing and so am I
I see you on the other side travel light
Ay Im faster than the speed of sound
Smashing through these barriers Im blasting out your speakers now
Travel around the planet till I landin where Im needed now
We entertainers they wanna call us leaders now
Woah extra baggage not in the plans Ill shop when I land
Stop for the fans every airport from Okinawa to Osaka Japan
Stop assuming I live in your time zone
Jetlag is my reality the road is my home I roam
Your downfall is you should probably get out more
I been planning out tours with a band of outlaws
Im packing my bags just marijuana and magazines
Wrapping the flag around a pistol the red the black and the green
Never crashing the grill is mean when Im whipping machines
Dipping between all these commuters they moving slow like they sippin the lean
Are they living the dream Get to they office
And that computers drifting off until they spit start to drip from the screen
Travel light travel light
Traveling light travel light
You grinding til the sun up
Whether its cold murder the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die so
Brooklyn is changing and so am I
I see you on the other side travel light
City of broken promises my mission is reconnaissance
Its dangerous for anybody following
Thats why I take biting as a compliment its proof of my dominance
Its the haters way of congratulating me for my accomplishments
Well Im so atop of this demolishing all the charlatans
To whisper in the ears of your congressmen
Shoving dollars in their pockets the more we locked up the more they profiting
They building empires like Ottoman
Now who you wanna face The sharks in the water or the snakes in the boat
The lesser of two evils be fighting for fake votes
We walking through the valley of darkness so stay close
Need the light at the end of the tunnel to make a toast
Raise a glass to our glorious past we the wave of the future
Never confusing protesters for looters
Silencing Radioheads and OK Computers
Travel to Mecca like Mansa Musa so lets go
Yeah
