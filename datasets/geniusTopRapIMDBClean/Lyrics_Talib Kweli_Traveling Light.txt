Traveling Light Lyrics
I come from the God body era
I come from standing on street corners
Smoking blunts out of white owls with 40s
Building and destroying about the suns
And the planets and the moons and the stars
About the nature of man
About knowledge, wisdom, and understanding
And you had to show and prove
And you had to be right and exact
Voulez-vous, rendezvous, coucou le poopoo, come on!
Yeah Chris, yeah, I like that right there, yeah!
Hah, come on! Yeah
KAYTRANADA, classic

Waste these niggas, son, I got a doctorate in rockin it
Pardon, we got it poppin, it's marvelous, nigga watch it
You follow a carbon copies I'm stoppin' to intervene
You're erroneous, these the phoniest rappers I've ever seen
When I take flight, I'm traveling light, that's a double entendre
For when I'm touring, exploring outside the genre
Illuminate, when I grabbin the mic, it's so bright it'll blind you
Yeah I'm back with a friendly reminder
We're two ships that're passing in the night, but alas
You got to run into the iceberg, I'm cracking this shit in half
Traveling light, not talking about back of the back
First I get back in the lab, then I hit the road, I'll be back in a flash
I'm Barry Allen mixed with Harry Allen
My blood hot as volcanic rock forming canary diamonds they find on Canary Islands
My rhymes inspired by enviroments of the very violent
I'm the voice of a generation that's very silent
I stick to my convictions like I've been indicted
All you niggas throwing me shade you about to get enlightened
You might also like
Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

Ay, I'm faster than the speed of sound
Smashing through these barriers, I'm blasting out your speakers now
Travel around the planet till I landin where I'm needed now
We entertainers, they wanna call us leaders now
Woah, extra baggage not in the plans, I'll shop when I land
Stop for the fans, every airport from Okinawa to Osaka, Japan
Stop assuming I live in your time zone
Jetlag is my reality, the road is my home, I roam
Your downfall is you should probably get out more
I been planning out tours, with a band of outlaws
I'm packing my bags, just marijuana and magazines
Wrapping the flag around a pistol, the red, the black and the green
Never crashing, the grill is mean when I'm whipping machines
Dipping between all these commuters, they moving slow like they sippin the lean
Are they living the dream? Get to they office
And that computer's drifting off until they spit start to drip from the screen
Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

City of broken promises, my mission is reconnaissance
It's dangerous for anybody following
That's why I take biting as a compliment, it's proof of my dominance
It's the haters' way of congratulating me for my accomplishments
Well, I'm so atop of this demolishing all the charlatans
To whisper in the ears of your congressmen
Shoving dollars in their pockets, the more we locked up, the more they profiting
They building empires like Ottoman
Now who you wanna face? The sharks in the water or the snakes in the boat?
The lesser of two evils be fighting for fake votes
We walking through the valley of darkness so stay close
Need the light at the end of the tunnel to make a toast
Raise a glass to our glorious past, we the wave of the future
Never confusing protesters for looters
Silencing Radioheads and OK Computers
Travel to Mecca like Mansa Musa so let's go
(Yeah!)Embed
