Ayo Fedwhassup bro
Whassup with me You know whats up with me man
Im trying to get paid in full
Check this out right
Since Javotti is the label
And Im talking over this def beat right here
I think we should turn it up
We got my man  TrtrTrend on the beat 
Thinking of the master plan
Where theres nothing but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket my prophet is heaven sent
I dig deeper you know I represent represent
Yeah money over bitches my sisters go over everything
My bandz will make you dance Im forever like a wedding ring
Far above the hate and the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Trying to get away from the 85ers like Evelyn
Ride with me I got em leaking like Nene
Got em leaking like Wiki these monkeys biting like hickeys
Cause theyre seeing what Im doing filling them with confusion
Cutting just like a truant Im fluent just like a student
Of the romance languages only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnishes just like your wages is
The cribs outrageous like really its no joke
The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke loud
Turn it up loud turn it up loud
Turn it up loud turn it up loud
Drop it stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up turnt up turnt up for the people
You can feel the heat from your speaker my sound will darken your features
Run it down like a zebra I move with the speed of cheetahs
Im from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a twolitre
I aint asking for no followers Im looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming all through my semen
So every time I bust babies begin being born
Talk turns tough til them toasters thats tucked get
Drawn like a picture picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leaders the lazy is lollygagging
On my grind getting guap guess green is the new black
Meet me at the bar we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car you know who blew that loud
Ayo we drink good smoke good
These cats wearing funny hats like the pope would
I come in looking quite clean in the loafers
So hood might scheme up to no good
You no crook Gosling in the Notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I Wood
I still rep POCs like Im supposed to
Coming live from death row like I know Suge
My rhymes like a laser beam  so focused
Im in the ring so lean I need a foam cup
I aint lying bare teeth so ferocious
Maybe Im lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and Im floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music Im complete in my devotion
Word say it again 
Im complete in my devotion
