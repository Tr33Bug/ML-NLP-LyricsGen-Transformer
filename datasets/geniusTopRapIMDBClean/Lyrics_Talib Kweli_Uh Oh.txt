Psychopath ride a tricycle in a bikers club
Mike Tyson face tatted addict like it rough
Hey scatterbrain dont get your grey matter punched up
Til youre hunched tucked talking like you punch drunk
One love two maybe if Im drunk enough
Naked watching three painted ladies do the bump and rub
Mean mugging Jean the Heebs call meshugenah
Booking her in the Catskills like look at her rap skills
Ebook in the backpack the nerd in the Rat Pack
Jean Martin de Bergerac you heard of her murder rap
Her murder rep then learn it confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible use it for burning cardio
Dont use it with burners theyll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murders lock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder before murder murder fuck it murder
Make it four insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo assertive girl infernal glow
Eternally superlative blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge hurt her no
Tyler Durden nerve in this the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black the boys a Black Star rap star
Jean a rock star minus the Pharrell and all the cop cars
Rock soft lock bars with the realest in the spot
Really yall should get on your knees and pray us for our forgiveness say

Im a man of God who asked the Devil for some face time
The Shaitan you never see him coming cause youre faith blind
The mainline Bloods is waving flags like KNaan
The Crips throwing gang signs
The Beast in the street bear they teeth like a canine
Get low like the bassline
Jean and Kwa think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head what makes you think that you can take mine
They know theyll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Run the track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline so we keeping the fire burning
We speeding like Valvoline and we speak for a higher purpose
You believe in magazines I deliver entire sermons
You need some Vaseline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life so
Picturing yourself as a gangster the only way that you shooting
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic erotic catch phrases just to get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when Im spitting game Im adding on
Rappers going hard the GOAT I got an acronym for Capricorn
Centered And Prepared Rigorous Innovative
Captivating Ordinary Regular Nigga just
Growing daily your chick goin crazy yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rocking the fresh kicks like you felt the baby
Well wait til you done being whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wondering why dudes is dressing funny in rap
They need attention dog there aint no more money in rap
So if you mixing with GarageBand videos on the Flip cam
Im a big fan you got more heart than Bret The Hit Man
But shit damn its the pinnacle gets no better
Im boasting but still stay humble
Never cynical Im posting
Been a long time shouldnt have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh shouldnt have left you
Without a dope beat to step to say
Uh oh uh oh uh oh
Cmon the word is back
