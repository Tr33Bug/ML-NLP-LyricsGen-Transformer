Heed the battle call check the catalog
Flow so crazy its adderall with the padded walls
More twisted turns in the body thats on the baddest broad
These cattle call rappers is weak my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante  Kenny I mean the Latter more
No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off son
You want Nigerian money see me in Qatar drunk
Waving the K I cant fake the funk
Blessed with the belts flying in the stealth
Jewelry on the neck diamonds in the Cheals
You know I wrestle with pawns getting my money we gone
The automatic laying player we Dons
You cant see us the new phenoms I like the Benz zeons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fianc at least a Beyonc I know my vision beyond
Some other shit Im just as meaty as moms
Im supposed to be on the greenery gone Im still the king of the drama
Put the Ruger down your throat eat my Johnson nigga
Way they all in their feelings whats wrong with niggas
Forgetting silence is still a response
The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist
I get it like Whitey Bulger til rapture dearly departed
We gon Lex in my nigga these are blessings my nigga
Keep stressing my nigga dont stress little nigga
Eat a clip little nigga niggas trip little nigga
Violations we gon flip little nigga
We gon Lex in my nigga these are blessings my nigga
Keep stressing my nigga dont stress little nigga
Eat a clip little nigga niggas trip little nigga
Violations we gon flip little nigga
Its the champion flow the Jordan LeBron and Kobe
The Obi Wan Kenobi of getting that guapamole
We touring overseas got her fanning out like a Dakota
Im trying to get the check Im Martina Navratilova
Catch me at the races gateway at Saratoga
They trying to place my face cause we mobbing we taking over
My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda
These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga
Couch potatoes now they made us into a vegetable culture
A result of division like its a decimal quotient
Do the math my nigga do the math
Youd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half
Ayo rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip
Im so amazing with words I make a baby spit
Resting in Tibet wild with the Gillette
Giraffe long goose on my boots is 
Pocket full of coins producers on set
Niggas with the coupes is on next
The losers gon step the users gon check
We choosing our ninjas the Jews is on deck
Refuse thats a debt pool with the steps
Everybody see us the tools is all TECs
Anything come through we school wan bet
Fuck you gon tell us He knew we on next
They wanna act like they know me you dont know me nigga
You got the baby boy hustle you a Jody nigga
You wanna swim with the sharks Im Chief Brody killin
Get your jaw tapped this is raw rap come on yeah
We gon Lex in my nigga these are blessings my nigga
Keep stressing my nigga dont stress little nigga
Eat a clip little nigga niggas trip little nigga
Violations we gon flip little nigga
We gon Lex in my nigga these are blessings my nigga
Keep stressing my nigga dont stress little nigga
Eat a clip little nigga niggas trip little nigga
Violations we gon flip little nigga
