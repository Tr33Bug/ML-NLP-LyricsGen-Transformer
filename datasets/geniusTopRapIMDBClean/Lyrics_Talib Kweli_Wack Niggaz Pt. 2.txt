Wack Niggaz Pt 2 Lyrics
Yeah
Yolet me let me let me let me tell you why  why
This niggawhy we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one duke is drivin in the motherfuckin projects
With a  with a Sebring and with  with a rag off
Ynamean Yyou not ballin like that playboy
Straight up then the bitch you got playin shotgun
Like I used to serve that bitch cmon
Really really good I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga
Wack niggasI dont even like to be around em
Give em dap or pound em
See em out they houndin dawg
Sayin they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin they hot when that shit dont even sound warm
Nigga Im nasty my style is sound porn
The graphic exposin wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldnt be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K
The pastor say we goin to mass today
We have to pray these niggas is wack n eh
I have to say since Pac passed away
Most these niggas dont even deserve a track from me
First of all lets get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Ysee the whiskay had them girls feelin friskay
You was with mey she said Whos the sissay
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl dont like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya No hable ingle
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself


Wack nigga  Wake up in the morning dawg and you a
Wack nigga  Id kill myself if I was that
Wack nigga  Everything you wear and rock is just
Wack nigga  Even if you flossin rocks you still
Wack nigga  You cant do it dawg yous a
Wack nigga  Bitin ass bitch ass trick ass
Wack nigga  Even your daughter says My daddys a  
Wack nigga  You wack nigga 
You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
Thats how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to Say Yes like Floetry
The clique that I oversee aint impressed by ya poetry
Youre the place youre supposed to be
You aint aint comin close to me
It aint that you underrated
Its more that youre under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes youve ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldnt get the clearances
For them its just a check they dont respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is Murder Death Kill
But you never shot nothin never have never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees thatll add to ya problems
In the beginnin God created man in his own image
Im bout to tell you how the story gon finish
Kweli handle his business niggas dont forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Namean  you all can get it Im conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin that shit like You hold a gat right
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light  act right
You got it twisted tellin niggas that you pack heat
You aint gunning now you runnin like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin like Allen Ive
Start speakin Nuwaubian and followin Malachi
Or anything but rhyme you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio youd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all yall fuckin the game up
Its time to change up my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin if Im nice like fuckin with a chick
Who dont give head  thats a nobrainer
Niggas back bangers you dont even know the names of
Imma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli thats how you get got boy
Not that Im wildin or even promote violence
Its just youre fuckin up my high can a nigga smoke in silence
