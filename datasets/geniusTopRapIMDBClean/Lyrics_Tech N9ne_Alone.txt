Somebody shoulda told me
Life can treat you really coldly
A lot of love that people show me
But when they go Im hella lonely
When the music and the show stops  Chea 
Security keep my bus door locked  Chea 
Thataway Im not receiving no shots
MJ our little bro dropped and thats why they keep me so blocked
Chea  Im in the star coach now
In the back by myself I listen to our dope sounds but  Chea 
There was no women to round up  Chea 
This hound just sleeps deeply anticipatin the next towns luck  Chea 
Its glitz and glamour when you on the stage
Happy cause you and your homies paid
But a lot of my love ones up and gone away
Because I put my music first for that its lonely days
Oh aint no phones ringin
Aint no one speakin when youre alone
Oh feels like theres no reason
For me to keep breathin if Im gonna be alone
I cant sleep alone
And I cant go eat alone
Yeah the crowd gon shout
But when the lights go out you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know me being me
You wouldnt think Id be
Alone
Got off my tour July Seven my children
Kicked it with me up to the 24th then they go home  Chea 
Even though my home used to be they home
But due to separation and altercations with their mamas it left me so alone  Chea 
And when my girl visits  Chea  she got to leave
Cause shes independent and has a need to make her own cheese  Chea 
At night before sleeping Im on knees  Chea 
Alone Please I dont wanna have the lonelies  Chea  on Beeze  Chea 
My two family members that room with me  Chea 
They zoom quickly to work and dip outta town you would assume itd be  Chea 
Party party every night a gnarly nudie show  Chea 
But its hardly a party when you starting in the studio  Chea 
I cant wait for the meet and greets makin fans
Thats why I be hella happy hugging and shakin hands
When I perform I want everybody to know
I stretch the show cause when its over everybody go
Oh aint no phones ringin
Aint no one speakin when youre alone
And oh feels like theres no reason
For me to keep breathin if Im gonna be alone
I cant sleep alone
And I cant go eat alone
Yeah the crowd gon shout
But when the lights go out you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know me being me
You wouldnt think Id be
Alone
A storm cloud stalks me making what should be a sunny day
Shed tears of lonesome despair in the form of rain
Ive devoted my life to rid you of your pain
For feelings of acceptance which reveal themselves feigned
Do not mind that scream the voices in my brain
But if I stop giving only I remain
Though I know not of misery
For I lack the company it needs to be entertained
But misery would be a nice change
This solitude drives me insane
Yeah I think its my fault yall
Cause Im reclusive  Chea  and Im thinking I lost broads
Like Y Exclusive  Chea  and I know that I might fall
Cause life is stupid cause cupid shoots it and I fight off
What it might produce its love whatever has it I run
People pets and even movies that have it I shun
Thinkin back when I had a family was glad I was some
I picture myself in the future old mad sad cause Im one
Oh aint no phones ringin
Aint no one speakin when youre alone
Oh feels like theres no reason
For me to keep breathin if Im gonna be alone
I cant sleep alone
And I cant go eat alone
Yeah the crowd gon shout
But when the lights go out you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know me being me
You wouldnt think Id be
Yeyeyeye alone
