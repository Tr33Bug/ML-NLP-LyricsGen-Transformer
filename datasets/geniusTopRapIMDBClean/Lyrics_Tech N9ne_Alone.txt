Alone Lyrics
Somebody should'a told me
Life can treat you really coldly
A lot of love that people show me
But when they go I’m hella lonely

When the music and the show stops (Chea)
Security keep my bus door locked (Chea)
Thataway I’m not receiving no shots
MJ, our little bro dropped and that’s why they keep me so blocked
(Chea) I’m in the star coach now
In the back by myself, I listen to our dope sounds, but (Chea)
There was no women to round up (Chea)
This hound just sleeps deeply, anticipatin' the next town’s luck (Chea)
It’s glitz and glamour when you on the stage
Happy ‘cause you and your homies paid
But a lot of my love ones up and gone away
Because I put my music first, for that it's lonely days
Oh, ain’t no phones ringin'
Ain’t no one speakin' when you’re alone
Oh, feels like there's no reason
For me to keep breathin' if I’m gonna be alone
I can’t sleep alone
And I can’t go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gon' shout
But when the lights go out you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know me being me
You wouldn’t think I’d be
Alone

Got off my tour July Seven, my children
Kicked it with me up to the 24th, then they go home (Chea)
Even though my home used to be they home
But due to separation and altercations with their mama’s it left me so alone (Chea)
And when my girl visits (Chea), she got to leave
‘Cause she’s independent and has a need to make her own cheese (Chea)
At night before sleeping I’m on knees (Chea)
Alone, "Please, I don’t wanna have the lonelies" (Chea), on Beeze (Chea)
My two family members that room with me (Chea)
They zoom quickly to work and dip outta town, you would assume it'd be (Chea)
Party, party every night a gnarly nudie show (Chea)
But it’s hardly a party when you starting in the studio (Chea)
I can’t wait for the meet and greets, makin' fans
That’s why I be hella happy, hugging and shakin' hands
When I perform I want everybody to know
I stretch the show ‘cause when it’s over everybody go
You might also like
Oh, ain’t no phones ringin'
Ain’t no one speakin' when you’re alone
And oh, feels like there's no reason
For me to keep breathin' if I’m gonna be alone
I can’t sleep alone
And I can’t go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gon' shout
But when the lights go out you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know me being me
You wouldn’t think I’d be
Alone

A storm cloud stalks me making what should be a sunny day
Shed tears of lonesome despair in the form of rain
I've devoted my life to rid you of your pain
For feelings of acceptance which reveal themselves feigned
Do not mind that, scream the voices in my brain
But if I stop giving, only I remain
Though I know not of misery
For I lack the company it needs to be entertained
But misery would be a nice change
This solitude drives me insane
Yeah, I think it’s my fault, y’all
‘Cause I’m reclusive (Chea), and I’m thinking I lost broads
Like Y! Exclusive (Chea), and I know that I might fall
‘Cause life is stupid, ‘cause cupid shoots it and I fight off
What it might produce, its love, whatever has it I run
People, pets and even movies that have it, I shun
Thinkin' back when I had a family, was glad I was some
I picture myself in the future, old mad, sad ‘cause I’m one

Oh, ain’t no phones ringin'
Ain’t no one speakin' when you’re alone
Oh, feels like there's no reason
For me to keep breathin' if I’m gonna be alone
I can’t sleep alone
And I can’t go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gon' shout
But when the lights go out you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know me being me
You wouldn’t think I’d be
Ye—ye—ye—ye, alone
