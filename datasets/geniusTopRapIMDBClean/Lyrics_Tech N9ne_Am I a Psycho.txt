I see you looking at me
Psst hahaha over here 
Looking at me so I ask
Am I a psycho
Am I a psycho
Yeah Im a psycho
I guess Im a psycho
Youre crazy I like you but youre crazy
My tours paid me so I used that dough to allure ladies
To manure bathe me
Never that my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades Rev X said that he couldnt endure to save me
Why do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row
When I felt that burn I palm the clitoris Ima get her wet
Sorry to get carried away
I feel stupid cause I aint did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
I get vexed so N9ne bit her neck
Open I try to contain it but that dame thangs soakin
Alter ego say Why you let them gangbang folk in
Strange Lane hopin I can maintain copin
But aint nobody talkin when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin blood on my draws
From up on her walls Im sufferin Im stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws huffin and puffin hollerin Im a dog
Afterwards I like really hot scaldin water on my balls
Am I a psycho
Am I a psycho
Yeah Im a psycho
I guess Im a psycho
Mom Dad Im no longer the boy youre used to seein
Ive changed a lot plus Ive grown to hate every human bein
My mood swings have now turned
My dreams into gruesome scenes
Now Im doin things I dont normally do when illusion seem
To be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck if I was sane I wouldve put down the mic
And said Fuck it Ill never rise to fame
But with the wicked wreckage I contain
I could probably jeopardize your name
No loveydovey lets ignite the flame
If youre lucky youll survive the pain
Sorry that aint very merry to say
Why is this game so scary to play
Well let me think cause every day
My balls are gettin too hairy to shave
Pause a minute Im stressin again
If I go to Hell then Heavens to blame
I dont mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think Im hella deranged
When I was seven years old
I fell on my head and I severed my brain
You think Im lyin Then ask my mama
Nigga shell go tell you the same
Should I be ashamed No
Im livin my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent out of shape
My nigga let me ask you this
Am I a psycho
Am I a psycho
Yeah Im a psycho
I guess Im a psycho
I stab you with this mic and rap this verse Im rappin to you
Matter of fact Im rappin through you
Never say my motherfuckin name
Unless you absolutely have to
I am not no fuckin jacket with no matchin shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Cant even see you niggas yall wish I was rappin to you
Matter of fact act like Im rappin to you
If that gives you passion to use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That Im attackin you dudes its just like oldfashion voodoo
Yall aint even the shit no yall aint even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my two boots
So Im slappin you foolish with wooden paddles you stupid
Babysittin little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic but its more like schizophrenic
And I cant sleep can anyone tell me
Just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear Im all about my brain like graduate students
Im sorry I didnt mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears come here give me your face let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look
If I were to peel it back with a skillet
Then Ima feel it crack when I hit it
Then Ima split it back when you heal it
Damn it Bobby boy What in the hell
What in the heaven What in the Earth
Where is your mom What are you cursed
Where are you from Where was your birth
Where was you first Why werent you in church
Why is there dirt all on your shirt
Man I think that youre goin berserk
Am I a psycho
Am I a psycho
Yeah Im a psycho
I guess Im a psycho
Am I a psycho
Am I a psycho
Yeah Im a psycho
I guess Im a psycho
