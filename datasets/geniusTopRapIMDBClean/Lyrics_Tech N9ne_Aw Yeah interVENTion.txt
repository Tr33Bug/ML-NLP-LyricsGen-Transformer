Aw Yeah  interVENTion  Lyrics
DomineDomineDomineDomine
Question for the maker and its Aw yeah
This the way its supposed to be huh Aight
Sippin
On a glass of red wine
Right before bedtime thinkin
Everybody down here trippin
If you up there upstairs this is N9na tellin you to listen
The vision Im givin every day life is dumpin on us like a pigeon
I get many enemies with this Forbes list
But I get rid of energy from piss poor pricks
Can I get to heaven
All I get is threatened every time I get more chips
Gotta grip fourfifths for the sick forces
I gotta fight all of the night with cops Crips Bloods with sore fists
And them Nazis wanna hem Hadji up it aint too many men godly
Hideous so many cities bust in Ferguson to Libya Benghazi
Human equality never been a level playin field man it been wobbly
So many circles of sin rob me thats why we go angel to grim Cosbys
Yellin this to my superior the grading of love is inferior
Upon this earth a lot of people jerked around
About 300000 to Syria are you serious
I could never think of buryin my children ppperiod
Nigeria
Ima yell while Im walkin through this Hell cause Im furious
Zuse know whats up he said you gotta pack a toy  Toy toy toy 
But why you got to let the bodies drop in a coffee shop in Aussie  Aussie Oi Oi Oi 
But around here lovin cocos the bomb
Meanwhile so many people are taken out by the hands of Boko Haram
Aw yeah  Aw yeah Aw yeah 
They gotta suffer the penalty cause of our education
Nobody wanna say nothin but I gotta call it abomination
Pissed off they go at this cost
What these babies blood drippin for
So I say in Latin listen Lord
Audire domine  Audire domine 
Audire domine  Audire domine 
Only way people are gonna be able to kill off a demon is
Pick up a gun and be ready to put it between him a nigga be screamin
Audire domine  Audire domine 
No fear the only way
Every day flatten the beast
At least Anonymous is hackin for peace
And yet we gotta bust cause we packin a piece
Choke not another one of us for the snappin police
Who the hell a brother gonna trust when its always dishonor
Hate me like Obama
And I aint even got around to askin you the question God
What about my MAMAAAA
