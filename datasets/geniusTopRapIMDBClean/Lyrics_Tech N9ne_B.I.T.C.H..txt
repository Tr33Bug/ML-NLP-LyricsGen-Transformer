BITCH Lyrics
No you aint supposed to put on your devil suit
When you come up in the church young mayne hehehehehe
Now they aint about to think you a rebel
You bout to make them think you birthed from flames
La la ladidada
Wanna be on TV just to show out for mi mama
But breakin into colored houses admit
That its a bitch when you sick like this
Puttin all the face paint I can put on
Put my black jeans and black hood on
Thats your TV I just stood on
With a faded habit this brother swerves when I sip vodka
Im the latest rabbit in other words Im a hip hopper
You disc jockers never played me you said my shit stopped ya
2001 I mixed opera now every cliques got the
Sick caca with lots of rippin about they chips oughta
Listen to this quick chopper flippin and poppin
With the spirit of Pac and Big Poppa
Ya This for your motherfuckin rap quotes
My shit is surprising and shocking like Barack votes
The traps broke when I rapped with Tunechi and Stacks though
OG Muggs said Im gonna be the first rapper to cross over to black folk
Yah Im breakin into colored houses
Polo boots and hella darkcolored outfits
Yah Im breakin into colored houses
Fellas better put a chastity belt on your spouses
Hey
Man it must suck to be you niggas cause it dont suck to be this rich
If you not fuckin with me brethren you can suck upon this dick
Man I just get it how we get it where I live
Somebody better call 911  Call 911  Im breakin in these niggas cribs
Yeah we out here workin
One thing for sure two things for certain
Im for real thats how I live
Somebody better call 911  Call 911  Im breakin in these niggas cribs
Since 2001 my people dodged me like Durango
Now at my shows I see more Nwords than Django
From Missouri  Like Nelly Chingy and Chain Hang Low
But Kansas City somewhere over the rainbow
Im in yo house baby Im in yo living room
Lookin down yo blouse lady and everybody is in tune
To Tech N9na sex fiend a threat to his and whom
They got a beautiful woman and givin poon
They want it because Im bout to be big and boom
Breakin into colored houses is hard mayne
Cause everybody got  Guards 
And they got  Dogs  and they got bars mane
But Im comin through that TV
And all the ghetto is gon see me
Sippin the KC Tea
Nigga know Tech N9ne now everybody want a freebie
Damn Im breakin into colored houses
Polo boots and hella darkcolored outfits
Yah Im breakin into colored houses
Fellas better put a chastity belt on your spouses
Hey
Man it must suck to be you niggas cause it dont suck to be this rich
If you not fuckin with me brethren you can suck upon this dick
Man I just get it how we get it where I live
Somebody better call 911  Call 911  Im breakin in these niggas cribs
Yeah we out here workin
One thing for sure two things for certain
Im for real thats how I live
Somebody better call 911  Call 911  Im breakin in these niggas cribs
My people missin me like Diana Ross
No this aint MMG but I am a boss
Although Im wicked see Im fly and I floss
So why am I lost Like my jam is off
Yes you a day late better late than never Im a veteran
My cheddar been truly silly like Stevie J face  haha 
Every last one of these evil haters they see me vacate
Dip to the crib turn on the television and see my face like Hey wait
Hey
Man it must suck to be you niggas cause it dont suck to be this rich
If you not fuckin with me brethren you can suck upon this dick
Man I just get it how we get it where I live
Somebody better call 911  Call 911  Im breakin in these niggas cribs
Yeah we out here workin
One thing for sure two things for certain
Im for real thats how I live
Somebody better call 911  Call 911  Im breakin in these niggas cribs
Its Strange you know what Im saying like
Fuck what everybody doing we doing this
Thats the Strange Music spirit
Fuck you you on bullshit we going this way
Thats the Strange Music spirit
