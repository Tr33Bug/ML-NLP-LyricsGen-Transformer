Caribou Lou Lyrics
Yeah, it's like the ultimate party favor baby ya know?
2 cups will get her hot and out of her clothes ya know?
Caribou Lou it's like

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come
Half a bottle of 151 off in a jug
1 cup of Malibu Rum, baby that's whassup then you
Fill the rest of the jug with pineapple juice and it's crackin'
The only defect is waking up like what happened
I like red light parties and fed right bodies who like
Bread like Dolly and head right totties at night
Aribou Cay oulay
Terrible day you pay the liquor store teller
With no hair or toupee, touch√©
Get the party jumping, keep the hotties humpin'
I like 'em thick and juicy so don't Pilates nothin'
Drinkin' too much Lou you
Might be karate punchin' or at the back of the club
Attending the naughty luncheon
Satin, coolaid gives you hella 151 November dog so run kitty run
We gon' drink it until we dumb-ditty-dumb, bum-bitty-bum
Here Kansas City come so give me some

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
We gon' party 'til the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come
You might also like
I see double, I see triple
Might be trouble, might see pistols
We ain't tryna hear you haters sucking on sickles
We living it up in two double O sizzle
Wonder you may bro, until your day go
Why I'm the one to drink you under the table
And all the ladies I will do in time
Once you become a member of my drinking club you will find Tech N9ne
Trying to tell her truly get nudey yes
I even do L-words in their fruity bizutti
Like to drink it and yell slurs at the movies
If I'm heated I'm off to get Caribou Lou to cool me
Created by Tech Nizzle and T. Wizzle one high day
We mixed it up and then I say we treat Caribizzle like our lady
Originated in Kansas City, Missouri since 1995 baby

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
We gon' party 'til the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come
Tarbender I need adrother nink
Release Caribou Lou in a party and it's utter kink
Insane manie, keep 'em coming then I'll remain zany
'Cause Sadatay baby I'm trying to make you my main damey
For the rest of the night, girl you're sexy, you're tight
Come to me casa and see the chakra flexin' you right
Groupies at 12 o'clock man I'll crawl, I'll go
Yeah I'll recruit 'em, but I better not crap that's all I know
Yep in my white T and Nikes you might sight me
Slightly hyph and might see dry heaves
Die we shall not need I.V.'s beside me Siamese
(Tech!) Huh? (You're not making any sense!)
I might make her wanna swing her Prada
But once I get up on the mic and do my thing I got her (Tech!)
Hey, batter batter batter batter sah-wing-a, batter
He can hit, he can hit, he can hit, sah-wing-a, batter

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu

Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
We gon' party 'til the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come
151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
