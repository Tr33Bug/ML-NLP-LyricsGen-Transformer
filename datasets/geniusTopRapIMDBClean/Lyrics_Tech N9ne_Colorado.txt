I came to turn the night up now watch me as I light up
Hey I smoke in Amsterdam in Denmark Christiana

Now when I go to my second home big Tech is prone to conjure
Some of that new legal purple good Colorado marijuana
Break it down pearl it up fire it up pass it round
Got that dope eighth of the dream
And a quarter with the purp when Im in the town
Nobody fucks with regular all my shit spectacular
Hit it for the low shit gotta be real loud and this wild next to ya
Rhino rolling in the most hydro mixed with indigo
Blaze that shit really cant get no high
But niggas still feel me though
Chokin dope blazin fire roll em up mile high
Lovin Colorado strawberry kush open wide
Put you lighters up in the sky when the nigga do it
For the homeboy Pakelika
Restin in Reefer smoking that Keisha
Through a vaporizer with a feature
Tech N9ne Ima kick it every time
When I ease my mind I hit my bottle
But they legalized it in my second home
When I go Ima hit that good Colora
Do  Do  do  Do  do  Do  do  Do 
You know its that fire I cant get no higher
Do  Do  do  Do  do  Do  do  Do 
I came to turn the night up now watch me as I light up


You already know what it is tappin bottles chippin lips
Rollin up another thumper then we on the way to kill another gig
Info Frizz Stevie Tech Ubi and Pcaso too
Chongin out in the open tokin smoke so loud that I cant hear you
Look at me walkin sideways wavy but Im not sloppy
And Im burnin down the bush with the chief
The spirits have got me
Better roll up you know Im cold as fuck
Going nuts iffin Im up in your place
Takin a hit of the purp Ima hold it in then blow it in your face
Cough cough  Info Gates

So if a cop finds this avocado
I got in this medicine bottle I gotta get gone
Be hittin the indica strain
When it get in my brain then it isnt the same
Im twistin the flame
Light up the Ces is definitely beneficial for the pain
That medical Jane never synthetic
You know photosynthesis gettin the blame
Blowin the legit if you switchin the state
Ah blow the piff and Im driftin away
When Im out in the Springs
With a mountain to king Im countin the ounces they bring
They offer that kush  Kush 
They burnin the bush they bout it no doubt its a thing
Im jackin the cyph
Livin in colorful Colorado over half of my life
I came from Arvada back in the day

Do  Do  do  Do  do  Do  do  Do 
You know its that fire I cant get no higher
Do  Do  do  Do  do  Do  do  Do 
I came to turn the night up now watch me as I light up
Been an outlaw for a minute though smokin out with no shame
Blowin loud out my sunroof back in the Sunshine State
But them boys offered that cake so its a cat and mouse type chase
So I growin eyes on my back and droppin brims over my face
I need a high estate elevate
Gotta get back up to that Denver stage
Where the fans are Strange and the air is thin
But the smoke is thick I just cant explain
Sparkin puffin passin
Ease your pain and all these forms of fashion
I think its only right we celebrate it just get
Upup high get em upup high
Stuck in the sky we got a lust lets fly
And I just met my angel dangled
With a halo and a bud supply
Went over limit and you heard the tale
About my freaked out tweaked out weed dungeon
But I forget about that when Im in the Do
See I be all up on them Green Funyuns
Took another trip out to the CO
Where they be telling me the liberty is legal
So thats no whiz test for your PO
We go to free load and debo Doritos
Showing love to Metropolis
And the brother with the funk on the side of the curb
Green cross in a season of moss
When they all breed crops and they dying to serve
Fort Collins to Boulder we smoke the average
We just feel wicked we on that Jodi Arias
Rollin and jokin these folks just stare at us
Trippin for no reason when its so hilarious
You high or something Yeah square you scared to puff
You wanna fly with me Yeah airfare is up
Just be careful when you hit it I got admit it
I been known for sprinkle these orange hairs with dust
Forgot where we was tried to order a Quarter Pounder
From a Taco Bell drivethru high so we drove off
On the road lost blinded from the smoke fog
Made it to the crib I hit the door and then I dozed off
Broke off my homies a couple buds
And ever since the day I did it I done got a bunch of phone calls
Ask me how much do an O cost
In Atlanta got em smokin on that dope dog yayauhyeah
When Im in another land I smoke that fireireire
I dont really hit to choke but tonight Im gonna tryyy
Take some weed mix it with tobacco leafs
Actually and breathe in and lose my faculties naturally
Okay  Worldwide now following Tech Nina
Take another hit if you got that reefer
Bring me a little bit of that sativa
Baby toast cause my anxiety dont like what I put up inside of me
I go back to the bottle when I take a hit of that Colorado
