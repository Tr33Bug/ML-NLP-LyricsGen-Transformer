Im an angeldemon man
You know what Im sayin what makes me a demon is lust a girl crazy and thats why I couldnt keep my wife
You know what Im sayin and thats the lust demon livin within me
And uh but my heart love big you know what Im sayin so
I know a lot of demons come to my shows as well as angels
You know what Im sayin a lot of demons
When I was one anda two anda three anda four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an ittybitty demon
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it  Hell no 
Can I kill it  Hell no  Can I kill it  Hell no 
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it  Hell no 
Can I kill it  Hell no  Can I kill it  Hell no 
Yo it make me wanna drink a lot go up in the pink with naught
This the reason I aint at ease and currently on the brink of pop
This the reason I sit at the window with the millie
Wishing a nigga gon come break in
It is the reason I be freaking a woman deeper
Loving making her silly because I done they friends
It is the reason I bang it is definitely the reason I slang
Distributed the caine
The reason Im supersoaking in the pain and starting to love it
Its wanting to give me way more of it they want me to lug it through the mud
And thus the reason with happy people Im disgusted
Im talking about those thangs that make you do bad thangs
Living the evil up in the fast lane
Making me wanna have a wicked persona
Beating the hell up out of people making me mad mane
Gave me the gun when I ran up in dealings in the ninth grade with a slight rage
I was Ice Age another reason Tecca N9na wont have any light days
Voted me the King of Darkness voted me to be really heartless
All up in my spirit they march they making me start sparking other targets
Woke up today I was steaming cause when I found out I was not dreaming
Because the host that influenced me the most was a goddamn demon


When I was one anda two anda three anda four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an ittybitty demon
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it  Hell no 
Can I kill it  Hell no  Can I kill it  Hell no 
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it  Hell no 
Can I kill it  Hell no  Can I kill it  Hell no
