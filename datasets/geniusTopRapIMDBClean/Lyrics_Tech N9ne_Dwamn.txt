Speaka my language
People I hang with
You cant find this in ya big book
Never heard before my crew bitch look
Hellurr straight crown and a burrr
And after Im finished you know Ima drink some murrr
But I got 2020 vision when Im pitchin listen
I spot them chickens never slippin like a transmission
You like Baileys I like ladies Im quite crazy
And maybe a little shady to hit tonight baby
Cookies I gotta bang they wanna hang with a real nigga
All day everyday by myself not a gang
Wanna go nightnight nigga
Ima so nice I lit up like a swisher
I dont know why thy bitter
Wont stroke by my ninuts Papa getcha
Wiwiwiwitch if you hide the puta
Away from me then you can blow me like a hookah
They know Im a crowded prusta
On the pooty tang ya booty bang
And I wish I was your loofah
Oooh youre sweeter than Dean and DeLuca

Thats enough to make the whole spot say DWAAAAAMN
Sound like when somebody get hit on Batman
Always looking for the pussy  CATscan
Bootys always being watched  black man
Never be caught messing around in the flatland
I solemnly swear to beat punini
Jiggly jello off in a petite bikini
Women waiting in line to meet my weenie
Wanna see me go Gandolfini
Dont you let me reach the creamy
Aint nobody got time for that
But I got time for getting you behind the clap
