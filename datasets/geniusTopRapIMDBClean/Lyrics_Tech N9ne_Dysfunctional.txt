First entry for Sickology 101 Dysfunctional
Yeah dont you bring me nothing stupid
If you dont want me to lose it
Step back if you dont want me to attack
Im a beast better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense get away from me
Me I wanna get dollars dont wanna holler but you makin me
Im a little dysfunctional
Youre the problem please dont awaken me
And Im that way cause back in the day most have forsaken me
Ladidadi Im at the party
On a drunk night with a punk might
Dudes tryin to pick a fight because hes sorry
That he aint Gotti like I be cause he
Sloppy not me costly rocks be spot free
But he dont know Im roguish surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded when exploded you cant hold us
And we dont got no scruples
We didnt come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Dont get loose because we cuckoo
Listen they call me genius I run the show
Women be on my penis its wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick dont you know
Im a little dysfunctional dont you know
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional dont you know
If you fool around and make me mad
Im a little dysfunctional dont you know
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional dont you know
Might fool around and make me mad
Dont make me mad
Born to hustle Im a product of environment
The game done changed so Ive been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I cant lose and I cant choose then Ill come back to spit
I got hit songs but Ive been gone so long that I dont fit
Kneeled at the throne but cant get on so I need me a lick
I write these songs but dont belong Im on some other shit
Im huntin leads in desperate need I hope its comin quick
Id wrap my brain to find a lane thats gon bring me some change
But its so strange my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since Im down it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but Im dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in I gets emotional
First implode and then explode I am combustible
So please dont push me play me pussy on some real shit
Wont be defeated if Im heated nigga oh shit
Im a little dysfunctional dont you know
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional dont you know
If you fool around and make me mad
Im a little dysfunctional dont you know
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional dont you know
Might fool around and make me mad
Dont make me mad
I aint no killer but dont push me
Goodygoody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoodie
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller yall or would he
Now I wanna be peaceful but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are you know how black people are
I peep em out try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to em but their evil keep on seepin out
Emotions get the best of me messed up
And then yall get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed feel like my destiny
I know yall think less of me cause Im always sick
And I cant let it be pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
Its gon be the death of me I need depakote
Just to cope while I keep throwin them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just unpretzel me
Tryin to pray for change but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses probably be fine
But if you get too close youll find out that I
Im a little dysfunctional dont you know
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional dont you know
If you fool around and make me mad
Im a little dysfunctional dont you know
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional dont you know
Might fool around and make me mad
Dont make me mad
