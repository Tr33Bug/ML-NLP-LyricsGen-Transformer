EBAH Lyrics
Im hella mixed up yes I know
A lot of good and bad stuff as I grow
So now that I gotta live life when Im both all I can say
Whats my name EBAH
EBAH  Come on 
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Fucking right Im a maniac and Im loving it
Call me anything but my motherfucking government
I can love a bit no a big my lovell get
But in my brain I stay insane and Im always on some other shit
Really wanna fuck a bitch EB cant get enough of this
See me take what I stuck her with then I gotta run and give it to another chick
Gutter trick suck a dick State the texture of a brick
Making them Magnum rubbers split what a prick the brothers sick
Now back to my love like to go there
Even when its annoying like long nose hair
I can so share my heart in the cold air
And its no fair the size of it is so rare
Bloody murder muddy word of wretched death rhymes
Take me light and my darkness will take your breath time
Call me Chakratease or you can call me Tech N9ne
But since I found my new sinister out of respect Im
Whats my name
Whats my name
Whats my name
EBAH
Whats my name
Whats my name
EBAH
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Liberate me Lord
Im an angel and on this wicked planet nobody understands my angle is love
I was sent from above but Ive landed in blood
Psycho bandit Ive become a frightful damage and scuffed
Missile you Mitchells are misinformed and mixed in the middle of my menace
Murderous Michael Myers my mimic
Mom you made a monster Im making minions in minutes
Money motivated mishap asmodeus monikers mended
Feel like Im on Molly heart as big as my body
When a hottie gets naughty its racing like a Ferrari
My obese heart swelling when it beats hard telling me
To freak not willing like a beast Im yelling
Bloody murder muddy word of wretched death rhymes
Take me light and my darkness will take your breath time
Call me chakratease or you can call me Tech N9ne
But since I found my new sinister out of respect Im
Whats my name
Whats my name
EBAH
Whats my name
Whats my name
EBAH
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
My heart smell like vanilla icing
If slicing my chest open a light beam of nice things
Of Christ brings bright wings placement from thy king
Night seems right around the corner in my dreams
Horse shit piss and human puke is this smell
To whom ever wondered my level this is hell
Inside my crown I kill a gangster with fecies pig tail
And Ill live a 137 years like Ishmael
Yeah Nigga it aint misspelled
EBAH there go creepy A Yates
Using women as a bait and they face fishscale
Just another nut all the others suck
Sweet as a buttercup and fake as a rubber duck
Evil brain angel heart yes I utter much
And I never cover up why  Im a Klusterfuk 
Whats my name EBAH
Whats my name EBAH
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
Evil brain angel heart
