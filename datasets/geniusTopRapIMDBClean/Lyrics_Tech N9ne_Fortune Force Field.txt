I can see it right in front of me
But something is saying no
Granted a lot has come to me
But some major ideas still trying to make it go
Fortune force field
I can taste it but cant drink it
I can make it when I think it
Cant mistake it so distinctive
Man I hate this man I dreamed it cant believe it
I gotta let it go
So  Its on for tonight
Oh  Hope this wall is ready for a fight
Yo  In this hole Im reaching for the light
No  A lot of dreams are lost in the night
Why you wanna try to take my bill ticket
I mean real wicked I seem real livid
Ive been filled with it I mean vexed
Unexpecttedness when everything is the best
I get a minute to rest but then a nigga regrets
I gets the money but next Im in debt
I won what  I mean I lost take green from a boss
Be the things that I dream but they intervene they get my creme then Im off
Whose they 
They turned the motherfuckin best position into a deposition
Dealing with that will make you wanna ex the mission
Never no checks to get to and thats the bitching
How do I maintain my autonomy
With so many leeches in this economy
My moaning is mearly monetary
But the moment its really gone is scary
Try to beat my high score but I fight forward despite lawyers
An eye for an eye because my types warrior
Never the less I inherit a mess a big floor spill
Im steady pushing to break down this fortune force field


So  Its on for tonight
Oh  Hope this wall is ready for a fight
Yo  In this hole Im reaching for the light
No  A lot of dreams are lost in the night
Yeah its like pulling a bad one
Get her off at the pad then get the Jimmy to stab some
But you cant and puddy is right there
Like a barrier or something keeping you from her such a negative type lair
You can never pipe nair when youve got it in front of you wanna do its a pitiful nightmare
Its like making a baby
You never having it is making you crazy
And toting a living human its making you weighty
Kick kick kick shaking your lady
Like late in the 80s got my name and got to taking the stage V
Told the people I got Satan to save me thats why radio be hating to play me
Everything you gain only brings you pain
But the fame it fools the brain
But you regain it through Strange
Yeah never put your guard down
Because I wanna bang bang bang hard now
Im a warhound never mistaken I kick walls down
To the ground and get applause sound because I got even then Im lard bound
So  Its on for tonight
Oh  Hope this wall is ready for a fight
Yo  In this hole Im reaching for the light
No  A lot of dreams are lost in the night
Lot of dreams are lost in the night
Lot of dreams are lost in the night
Fuck your litigation
We gon win just a bit of waiting
Everytime that I get ahead gotta be a motherfuckin drawback
So Imma draw back and bang them bitches til they all crack
MSC look what youve done to me
Kept the first five I done for me
And you others know that Caribou Lou belong to me
You come for me
Just know we will never settle war is what its gonna be
So  Its on for tonight
Oh  Hope this wall is ready for a fight
Yo  In this hole Im reaching for the light
No  A lot of dreams are lost in the night
Lot of dreams are lost in the night
Lot of dreams are lost in the night
Yeah been breaking down that fortune force field for a long time
Now I get my just due
