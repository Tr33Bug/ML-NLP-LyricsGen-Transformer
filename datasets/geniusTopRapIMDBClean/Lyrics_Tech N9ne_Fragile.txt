You said youd never ever break down
But here I am sweeping pieces off of the ground
You said youd never ever play to crowds
But Ive seen you hoping to play songs to them now
Ive spent all night long scared of tomorrow I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost pick it up slow before its gone
Were fragile
Wish Id have known 
I never thought Id be so fragile
Youre not alone 
If it didnt break before its about to
Weve been here before 
I dont ever want to change
Im fragile
I dont ever want
I dont ever
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and die
N9na be givin the remedy and why
Critics are really the enemy and I
Cant stand the way they slam todays gifted
Effin incredible get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
Im the N9ne Ima look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times itll be better leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin but lies quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin
Hes a beginner and hopes for your demise folks Ima despise
Never do try to listen
Its real  Im mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You dont really get why Im so pissed Understand this
Im an artist and Im sensitive about my shit yes Im
Were fragile
Wish Id have known 
I never thought Id be so fragile
Youre not alone 
If it didnt break before its about to
Weve been here before 
I dont ever want to change
Im fragile
I dont ever want
I dont ever


Tell me that Im famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know youre heinous
Tell me that you love me always thinkin of me
Unconditional Im hoping Im your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
Thats the feelin I get when youre concentratin
On this pen on this pad
Tell me youre willin to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin of pickin apart this track
Stop
Puttin my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin to bury a deep hole for mine
Drop
This is more than you and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin and abusin
What I call the realest comin from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger then I started shootin
That was nicotine Im bout to smoke em all
And journalists involved shouldve known my music
Were fragile
Wish Id have known 
I never thought Id be so fragile
Youre not alone 
If it didnt break before its about to
Weve been here before 
I dont ever want to change
Im fragile
I dont ever want
I dont ever
