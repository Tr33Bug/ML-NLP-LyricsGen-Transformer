Fuck Food Lyrics
Yum, a stick of 5 gum
Is the taste on my tongue
But for the right one, I'll spit it out
And place her right on
The night's young, meaning we minus
The bright sun, and I am numb like
I'ma slide 'em like white on a white bun
Like that when baby's stacked with a fat one
Action-packed with a rack and a little bit of
That Jack, she's passed 'em
Got a 36-pack of Magnums!
I'm Vlad and I'll bag 'em, put a bitch in the sack
And break her back and then I
Gotta go leave her lashed from the passion (I'm crazy)
Sick as hell for the ladies
They don't give a damn that I'm maine
Even though I'm so shady
Baby girl but don't play me
I ain't tryna have no babies
But baby you braised and so savory
Wanna excite ya, ignite the fight
So honey, taunt me
I just wanna bite you and watch you drip out Romanée-Conti
That's 11 Gs, angel from heaven she's, seven 3's, hot egg and cheese for Pain, Tech and Weez
I know what you saying
But you know I ain't playing, tryna get my dick sucked
Through my jeans
(The girls sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girls-girls sure look like fuck food to me)
Spin that booty ’round, drop it to the ground, let it make a sound, do-do it, baby
Do it like that, lemme see the kitty-kat, then I hit it from the back for the baby
(The girls sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girls-girls sure look like fuck food to me)

Uh, now put the pussy on my lip and dip
Yeah, let’s make a movie, I’ma flip the script
Yeah, I wax that ass like a q-tip
Yeah, float in that pussy like a cruise ship
Uh, ’cause I’m a nasty motherfucker
Yeah, I eat that pussy like the last supper
Yeah, I beat that pussy like brass knuckles
Heh, she call me daddy and she scream “Uncle”
Open up and spread, I’m pullin’ her hair, she pullin’ my dreads
I’m breakin’ her off, we breakin’ the bed
Fuck her like a dog, she shakin’ her leg
I’m killin’ it soft, I’m makin’ it red
I’m makin’ her talk, I’m makin’ her beg
I’m makin’ her crawl, I’m makin’ her run
I’m makin’ it numb, I’m makin’ it cum, I am
Young Weezy F. Baby
She wish she could make a copy of my dick and save it
(Ha-ha) Now close your mouth, don’t waste it
I got that fuck food, baby, come taste it
Tunechi!

I know what you saying
But you know I ain't playing, tryna get my dick sucked
Through my jeans
(The girls sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girls-girls sure look like fuck food to me)
Spin that booty ’round, drop it to the ground, let it make a sound, do-do it, baby
Do it like that, lemme see the kitty-kat, then I hit it from the back for the baby

When I get my mittens on this kitten
She’ll be bitten, then she missin’ (oww)
‘Cause she fucked up and let the Tech in
Canceled all of her ex men
If you think you got it, nigga, say it witcha chest, then
I’m gon’ be your sex friend, rippin’ off her dress, then
Nibblin’ on her neck and I’m makin’ her wet wit’ no question
Yeah, animal magnetism, the sadomasochism
Got way mo’ cash to give ‘em, but they don’t ask, just twist ‘em
I don’t have to give ‘em stacks for me to mash within ‘em
I’m they master, hit ‘em with a lash and a nigga fast to stick ‘em
And I like ‘em all colors, multi-mack can make ‘em all love us
And make ‘em do all of us, and we don’t be trippin’ on it ’cause we all brothers (Ha-ha-ha)
Y'all suckers if y'all be trippin' over broads, fuck ya
The policy we keep is cards shuffled
The bitch’ll run to let her jaws touch us, wall crushers
Anybody outside don’t get much news from me
‘Cause I get it in but I keep it on the hush (Who’s the G?)
This rush, you agree, this is stuff dude for fee
But the girls sho’ look like fuck food to me, ayy
I don’t know what you feel
I don’t know what you think
I don’t know what you see, my nigga
(The girls sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girls-girls sure look like fuck food to me)

I know what you saying
But you know I ain't playing, tryna get my dick sucked
Through my jeans
(The girls sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girls-girls sure look like fuck food to me)
Spin that booty ’round, drop it to the ground, let it make a sound, do-do it, baby
Do it like that, lemme see the kitty-kat, then I hit it from the back for the baby
(The girls sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girls-girls sure look like fuck food to me)

Now you see what I see
The lady’s mine, mine, mine, mine
Mine
Now you see what I see (Can you see?)
The lady’s mine, mine, mine, mine
Mine (She's mine!)13Embed
