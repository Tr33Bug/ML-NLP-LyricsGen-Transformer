Kingdom
From this day on
I will never  force  anything good
Down anybodys throat
Now before I start spazzin
Ima speak in a language
That the majority
Will understand
Niggas see me shinin
They know Tech Nina the best at the rhymin
Yeah but they aint buyin
Strange Music flyin
We steady climbin
Im still a wanted man
I get a hunnid band
Still I do Summer Jam
Woah
Tecca N9ne milla
Kansas City Killa
Turn up
Bubblin up with it because a nigga be gassin
Enemy know that Im ready for action
No matter the money we gotta go dummy Im wit it so nigga whats happenin
I feel like comin and do it with passion
Whenever Im in the booth Im real as ramen and juicy juice
And the vomit induced when the onyx been poop
Regroup and spin this shit
Learnin this level of linguistics
Lot of you who lose it love lickin limp bizkits
And I am done
Tryna shine a star of Donnie to the people like fuck this nigga
Soundin willed as Farrakhan he
Never can raise the bar upon me
I am on par with omni
Kill every thing in sight before the light say habari gani
Longevity haters dont wan credit me
When Im steadily reachin people like mom said itd be
They yawn heavily like they be gone medically
When Im bussin on this bitch industry like Ron Jeremy
This songs therapy Strangenetically bomb palms red if hes blond
Here to denouncin The Dons pedigree
Im a gnac linguist
Wit a black penis
I can act meanest
Cause Im a rap genius
Keepin em crack fiendish
Praise KOD please
For blowin up himself like his last name was Aziz
No kryptonite Ima be Superman makin Zod leave
Thinkin youre gonna do better youre puffin the odd trees
Godspeed 
Everybody know us
We aint gotta say it
They know cant nobody hold us
Maybe cause the flow screams
Inner city killa
Aint no coming from the shoulder
Strikin like a cobra
Kansas City 
Lightin up the dough
We gonna blow just like I told ya
Steady getting mo green
Killa
City
Soldier
Turn up
Low IQ listeners they bashin
Lightweight keeping me flashin
I dont think they ready for the murder for the slashin
From MMM chopping em up in pieces in a wicked fashion
Not a nigga left why you triggered then
From the hottest spitta fought a bigger Tech
How ya figured that
How ya gonna test a hobbler
Shoulda stayed behind the candelabra
The God does damage to whos talking fucking bologna  bologna 
About who the best from my crew the threat
From here to Budapest this how you shoot the tech
Ima forever be ripping you never be up and ahead of me
Cause Ima shooter do ya through your neck
Shake it till it open make a milli man I did it and I blew the check
For Petes sake
This music is gleamin but because all of the streamin will never reach cake
Good thing we didnt get our piece late we straight
Seven this beats great shoulda probably did it with Keith Ape
This is for the villains
Kansas City livers stackin paper to the ceilin
And fuck how they feelin
If they hate the way we movin cause we really make a killin
Make your broad leave
Cause she diggin me and my niggas we get it open like fob keys
Knock it out like the Alis but to you she was a rod tease
Not another soul will rock it whenever the KOD breathes
Godspeed 
Everybody know us
We aint gotta say it
They know cant nobody hold us
Maybe cause the flow screams
Inner city killa
Aint no coming from the shoulder
Strikin like a cobra
Kansas City 
Lightin up the dough
We gonna blow just like I told ya
Steady getting mo green
Killa
City
Soldier
Ooh Godspeed
If you think youre brave enough then come and try me
I kill everything in sight
People hate that the number one is related
To the greatest
Independent favorite
That made it hella rippin up stages
And gave it everything in pages
And gainin real amazing wages
Double eight did with Travis
Integrated now as the latest hits
Fuckin right nigga
We came up from the gutter
To lots of butter I put that on Uncle Ike nigga
Thanks to Carlton and Maudie N9ne was born
Now everybody on the globe gonna have their eye on
The Storm
