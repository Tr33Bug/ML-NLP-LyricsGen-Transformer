Godspeed Lyrics
Kingdom!
From this day on
I will never - force - anything good
Down anybody's throat
Now before I start spazzin'
I'ma speak in a language
That the majority
Will understand

Niggas see me shinin'
They know Tech Nina the best at the rhymin'
Yeah, but they ain't buyin'
Strange Music flyin'
We steady climbin'
I'm still a wanted man
I get a hunnid band
Still I do Summer Jam
Woah!
Tecca N9ne milla'
Kansas City Killa'
Turn up!
Bubblin' up with it because a nigga be gassin'
Enemy know that I'm ready for action
No matter the money we gotta go dummy, I'm wit' it so nigga whats happenin'
I feel like comin' and do it with passion
Whenever I'm in the booth I'm real as ramen and juicy juice
And the vomit induced when the onyx been poop
Regroup and spin this shit
Learnin' this level of linguistics
Lot of you who lose it love lickin' limp bizkits
And I am done
Tryna shine a star of Donnie to the people like "fuck this nigga"
Soundin' willed as Farrakhan he
Never can raise the bar upon me
I am on par with omni
Kill every thing in sight before the light say "habari gani"
Longevity, haters don't wan' credit me
When I'm steadily reachin' people like mom said it'd be
They yawn heavily, like they be gone medically
When I'm bussin' on this bitch industry like Ron Jeremy
This song's therapy, Strangenetically, bomb palms red if he's blond
Here to denouncin' The Don's pedigree
I'm a 'gnac linguist
Wit' a black penis
I can act meanest
'Cause I'm a rap genius
Keepin' 'em crack fiendish
Praise K.O.D. please
For blowin' up himself like his last name was Aziz
No kryptonite, I'ma be Superman, makin' Zod leave
Thinkin' you're gonna do better, you're puffin' the odd trees
(Godspeed)

Everybody know us
We ain't gotta say it
They know can't nobody hold us
Maybe 'cause the flow screams
Inner city killa
Ain't no coming from the shoulder
Strikin' like a cobra
(Kansas City!)
Lightin' up the dough
We gonna blow just like I told ya'
Steady getting mo' green
Killa!
City!
Soldier!
Turn up!

Low IQ listeners they bashin'
Lightweight keeping me flashin'
I don't think they ready for the murder for the slashin'
From MMM chopping em up in pieces in a wicked fashion
Not a nigga left, why you triggered then
From the hottest spitta, fought a bigger Tech
How ya figured that
How ya gonna test a hobbler
Shoulda' stayed behind the candelabra
The God does damage to who's talking fucking bologna (bologna)
About who the best, from my crew the threat
From here to Budapest, this how you shoot the tech
I'ma forever be ripping you never be up and ahead of me
'Cause I'ma shooter, do ya through your neck
Shake it till it open make a milli' man I did it and I blew the check
For Pete's sake
This music is gleamin', but because all of the streamin' will never reach cake
Good thing we didn't get our piece late, we straight
Seven this beats great, shoulda' probably did it with Keith Ape
This is for the villains
Kansas City livers stackin' paper to the ceilin'
And fuck how they feelin'
If they hate the way we movin' 'cause we really make a killin'
Make your broad leave
'Cause she diggin' me and my niggas we get it open like fob keys
Knock it out like the Ali's, but to you she was a rod tease
Not another soul will rock it whenever the K.O.D. breathes
(Godspeed)
Everybody know us
We ain't gotta say it
They know can't nobody hold us
Maybe 'cause the flow screams
Inner city killa
Ain't no coming from the shoulder
Strikin' like a cobra
(Kansas City!)
Lightin' up the dough
We gonna blow just like I told ya'
Steady getting mo' green
Killa!
City!
Soldier!

Ooh, Godspeed
If you think you're brave enough then come and try me!
I kill everything in sight
People hate that the number one is related
To the greatest
Independent favorite
That made it, hella rippin' up stages
And gave it everything in pages
And gainin' real amazing wages
Double eight did with Travis
Integrated now as the latest hits
Fuckin' right nigga!
We came up from the gutter
To lots of butter, I put that on Uncle Ike nigga!
Thanks to Carlton and Maudie, N9ne was born!
Now everybody on the globe gonna have their eye on
The Storm!6Embed
