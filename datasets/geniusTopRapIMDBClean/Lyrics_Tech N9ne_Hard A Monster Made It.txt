Hard  A Monster Made It  Lyrics
Strange Music I know yall see us
Yall saw that Forbes list 2 years in a row nigga dont play
And we still doing it
Harder than most of yall motherfuckers out there yall know it
Im bout to show you right here check it out
I been reppin heavy to all you tardy cats
While you gettin over with ya piss and farty raps
Been smokin hella enough to bring Bob Marley back
I still kill em all but I gotta shake em like where the party at
Let up ya dresses confess it Tech is impressive
His message eff it stretches from Zacatecas to Texas
Im excessive with breastses
When I press it meshes make messes
Thats where the sex is it breakfast
Yes they blessed as Hugh Hef is
Out rhyme the foes with all kind of flows
Time for the N9ne because Im the chosen
Never gotta be foolish to get the dough
Like a lot of you actin up on TV to get a ho
You dont wanna have to fight on my card
I give the type of choppin that should be barred
Im gonna shoot beyond the stars you try and disregard
My shit is hard Constipated
They wonder why its so killa cause a monster made it
My shit is hard Im the greatest
Look around thats why everybodys congregated
My shit is hard Constipated
They wonder why its so killa cause a monster made it
My shit is hard Im the greatest
Look around thats why everybodys congregated
Moon stricken yeah they think Im crazy
When they ask me how I rap so quick I say poonlickin
Dont play my shit youll have everyone in the room bitchin
Doomed if and you got  Rubbish  and now my tunes kickin
Four score seven years a ho
Knockin em down with me 99 beers to go
Chuggin around 50 mix the Lou then cheers to slow
Muthafuckas who never loved us simply cause they feared the flow
Spit lyrics to get vicious rippers to get the pit
Diss this and get whipped hit this trick with this pistol grip
Bitch this is the fifth if suspicious heres a stiffen of this
Sniffin this Wait what was I sayin
My shit is hard Constipated
They wonder why its so killa cause a monster made it
My shit is hard Im the greatest
Look around thats why everybodys congregated
My shit is hard Constipated
They wonder why its so killa cause a monster made it
My shit is hard Im the greatest
Look around thats why everybodys congregated


Just wear your coat if you enter the rain
Two dollar haters yeah Im a be a vender for change
Sender of pain to ya lady Imma lend her the thang
And she gonna take it from me and the newest member of Strange
Kings get assassinated castles all crumble
Forever lives the legend of a poet who is humble
Words to live by now I die by a strange code
About to kill this verse they call me Murs if you aint know
I dont rap fast Imma leave that up to Tech and em
Ces Bernz Krizz Rittz Wrek and the rest of em
Zero estrogen my heart it only pumps lava
DNA is black mamba with a little chupacabra
Im a monster Im a problem Im a motherfuckin beast
Im a red nosed pit off the motherfuckin leash
Im a livin fucking legend man the rest of yall just walking dead
Feral with a arrow call me Daryl takin off your head
My shit is hard Constipated
They wonder why its so killa cause a monster made it
My shit is hard Im the greatest
Look around thats why everybodys congregated
My shit is hard Constipated
They wonder why its so killa cause a monster made it
My shit is hard Im the greatest
Look around thats why everybodys congregated
Its getting to the point where
I dont even wanna work with rappers no more man
All these years trying to get em all to see
Now I just wanna do what I been doin
Just makin music for my technicians to bang
You know what Im sizzlin
Bang Bang Bang For Strange
Bang Bang Bang Were gonna bang For Strange
