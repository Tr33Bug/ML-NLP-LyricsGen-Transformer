To those who naysay
Hey hey
Hey Im lookin down on you niggas
Even though Im 58  195 pound on you niggas
So tall I cant even hear any of the sound you deliver
Me and my partners never see any of the hateful frowning you give us
Cause we splat little bitty braggin wack rappers
You happen to be the bastard that got mashed up
But down to the simple fact heres a strap past ya blast at ya
Thats after the yappin I put the cash in my last chapter thats laughter
Half path over vast money brag imagine a black Dracula
Smashin em with the gats upper class stature
It went to my head as my first time
To be cocky Im just a giant when I burst rhyme
My leg is humongous is yalls verse mine
Stomping em out I cant stop my leg like Robert Klein
Giant robot make you feel very low shank
I am so hot in my skills there be propane
Why Im gon squash them and kill every poor thing
Cause Im a huge Pillsbury dough mane
Hes a mental giant

Narcissistic hard to grip it
Dark and wicked arts prolific
Mars with the stars this is far lifted
Lyrics quit the Bawitibaw scriptures are terrific
Get a spitter with a bit of bitter marketed with
Scrilla then a fifth of Henny liquor start to twist it
Critters sit and shiver in the slit of zillas
Pit of killers gritters hit a clique of silly niggas all fictitious
On top of the game Im dropping the rain Godly gifted
Hop in ya lane and stopping yo fame bark is vicious
You got bars to witness ya submissive
When I get ya brain ya thoughts is shifted
Im incredible highly technical meant for triumph  raw intricate
I need medical then more science scars and stitches
Alphabetical gems blow by him pause a tidbit

Been floating for years and I aint landed
Haters cant stand it the way that my noggin is big as Kansas
But the women that listen wanna know if Im talking bout my damn dick
