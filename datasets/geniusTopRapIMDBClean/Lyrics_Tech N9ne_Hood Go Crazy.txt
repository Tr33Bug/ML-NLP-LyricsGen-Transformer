Hood Go Crazy Lyrics
Hello?
(I want to par-ty) Huh? (You want to par-ty?) Yeah
(We need to par-ty) Cool (let's have a par-ty) lemme get up

Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make a dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one, so it's guaranteed you can do you
'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo
Kan' City natives and we all a little coo-coo
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, "do it for me, baby"
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin' *Mwah*
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in then dip off, look for another chick then they pissed off
'Til I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross three thick friends
We mixin' these licks when they big friend wanna lip off
So I told her kindly, "Get lost, bitch"
This my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit!!

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, "do it for me, baby"
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche four door, white (TRU)
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her, I'm tryna knock her up
I'm tryna put a singer in her so I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender, thank God for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Tryna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, "Don't mess around with them pitbulls"

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, "do it for me, baby"
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
This the endin' from the N9ne
Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'gnac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up!
This Kan' City, shit's ran gritty
In the summertime the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Everybody got they hands up like (whoa!)
See a bad bitch like (ohh!)
This whole damn city fuckin' go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the Mo

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, "do it for me, baby"
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
