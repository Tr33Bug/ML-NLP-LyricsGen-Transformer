KOD Lyrics
Mhm okay
I hear you
No
Yes
Im your servant
I have the plan
And Ill give it to em
Like you told me to
Wanna live in my world you have to have a Tech tat
Preferably the number N9ne and you gotta get it
Where the back of your necks at
Thatll let me know that you rep that plus get you out of a death trap
You need it for living cause Im the king
And Im giving you the permission to get wit a no stress pact
Novus Ordo Seclorum cause the old world orders post mortem
Its failure inhaling sailing delta
Watched it swell and swelter
Til it was no male in shelter
Yes Im the one that provided ya shell in hell and held ya
When your politicians were welchers
So I built this structure just to help ya
So the communists cant come and quell ya
They call me the King of Darkness when I offer you no pain
Why would they label me heartless when your love is my cocaine
And your soul is my Rogaine I have a thirst to know your brain
When you enter my domain gotta take this number for your name
But you dont have to drink cyanide Im gonna be right by your side
If we gotta take that riot ride on the enemy and defy your side
Fight for the place were building
For the reproduction of more children
Trying to get that number back around 6 billion
Im gonna rule until then
Founded this colony like a pilgrim
Anybody try to penetrate this section or threaten we kill them
What if
K O D oh K O D oh
What if he is what he says he is
The King Of Darkness
K O D oh K O D oh
What if he is what he says he is
The King Of Darkness
Xes lliw eb yrotadnam yliad
Ylthgin this women need to be living by it
Stay fit and way driven paste it and dye it
I am the king killer captain crazed frigging pilot
Giving you these khaki pants and white shirt
Thats what you wear on my Earth
Eliminating your eye thirst to have any kinda desires
To envy material or admire my way will extract any type of divider
Im offering this wider
Understanding of life entirely
Blissfully evading friction and fire chea
The number N9ne will get you food even get you tools
To build anything your family choose but within my rules
All white shoes with red strings for all my crews
That lets me know you Techs people listening inside my pews
All your dreams and aspirations this is the affirmation
That you can reach em in my world its not a disaster waiting
No bruises and lacerations no choosers of aggravation
Im just tryna rehab a nation from exasperation
Its not an exaggeration Im something more than your blood and gore
On a level higher than devils or that of Satan


What if
K O D oh K O D oh
What if he is what he says he is
The King Of Darkness
K O D oh K O D oh
What if he is what he says he is
The King Of Darkness
When I did Anghellic I was good and bad straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reparation blew
Then demons had Absolute Power when I drug abused
So the angels searched for the Vintage Tech
But they found that the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life look necessary
So now receiving God the angel was Everready
But the Melancholy strikes the loving angels mommys life
So the Misery sat into the angels now becoming ice
So as mom got ill and iller when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made him bane
Theres no more angel straight up Killer
My apologies its not very God of me
To go crazy and try to teach the whole world Sickology
I was then split in two back to the beginning view
Angeldemon cause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids all the evil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you you can love big no matter how much mud you dig
Or dug you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
Im mostly angel and you know sometime we fall
Living under God and I hope its listening when I say I love you all
