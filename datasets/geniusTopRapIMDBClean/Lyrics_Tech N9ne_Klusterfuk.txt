I was born in November 8th day 1971st yall
9 oclock in the morning a Christian girl
In Kansas City gave birth yaah
She taught the kid how to love
And give all praises to our maker till the earth fall
Then mama married a Muslim when I was 12
And the transition was the worst yall
I converted to Islam but every once in awhile
Id read a bible verse yaah
How am I to refrain from eatin pork
And havin Christmas when Im thirst ahh
All of this it was blended many religions
Plenty women down my shirt yaah
At home no longer attended
When I was 17 I bounced like a nerf ball
Yeeeeah  Spit a bit quick 
By day I slay Pai Mei trick  dont get a bitch hit 
Im Master Ipin it Im flyin around with equipment
Really big time and now Im not fitness bitch
Im ridin around and Im grittin it
To the people the people that want the evil Im givin you
That and a coupla others a  Klusterfuk 
Of a brotha which you discover I  Crush mucks up 
In the gutter cause Im a thug and their  Tough just struck 
On you mofuckers Ill be the blood brother
Givin you love from a slug if you bug on a nigga
Tug on a trigga no hugs Ima kiss her with
Grudges and plug her with drugs when I give her dick
Fatherly when I spit on these kiddies dont bother me
In the brown and red dickies Mahogany
Red all over me like I hit a artery
Fuck all of these hypocrites lick a dick just swallow me
If you follow me and wanted to abolish me
When Im honestly straight oddity
Im just twisted nonfictitious on this wicked shit  Spit a bit quick 
Ready whenever machete will sever the head or
Be dead up then the leg up in the metal and  Big thick bricks 
Pucker up suck this nutter butter gutter slut
If you wonder what is uttered this is Klusterfuk
Ever seen a nigga with hella followers
And they love a nigga so much if he wanna tell them to kill
Hahahahahah And they will
So ya better watch that no it aint a shock tactic got that bit down to the grill
Hehhehhehhehhehheeeh Way real
I got the shit that get the crowd jumpin
Moshin a lotta thumpin silly just like a drunken monkey
Nigga we punkin flunkies Killa we krunk and funky
Uhh pumpin chunky Uhh booty bitches in the bunk with a donkey eh
Crazy I might be way in my psyche laid as a bright PA
Playin they wanna fight me
They dont really like me
Day and the night replay
Yeah Im good and a little bit of evil
Inside of me they about equal
Call it a bust when Im all in a rut
Im a Klusterfuk nigga yall is just  Fecal 


Growin up low enough must have sucked  People 
Call me what Call me a Klusterfuk  Fecal 
Growin up low enough must have sucked  People 
Call me what Call me a Klusterfuk
Talk about growin up fucked up
I grew up with a mentally ill mother so its no wonder that Im slightly askew
Her fanatical religious views had me sittin in pews eight days a week
And because of that me and God didnt speak for a while
Now I crack a smile when Im asked my religious preference
I utter a Tech N9ne reference replying Im a Klusterfuk
I mixed up all the stuff that religion had to offer
Boiled it in my cauldron till the bullshit burned off it all that was left was love
I cant say I always rise above the trivial shit in my life cause I dont
Sometimes my ego wont allow me to walk away if you know what Im sayin
Ive done a lot of drugs shit Ive done a lot of thugs but in the end
As long as Im aligned with love then I know Im livin righteous
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy  Growin up low enough must have sucked 
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically  Call me what Call me a Klusterfuk 
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy  Growin up low enough must have sucked 
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically  Call me what Call me a Klusterfuk 
Love it when the fans buy my memories
