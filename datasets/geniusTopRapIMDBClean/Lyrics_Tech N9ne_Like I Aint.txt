Ayy like I aint on 1 2 3Pac
Like I aint finna bust when my homeboy make the fuckin beat drop
Bustin a cap in the wack when Im rappin
You really need to trust in the fact that Im back and Im slappin
The industry for ducking the cat when he rap with a passion
When Im in this piece I crush in a fashion
Like I aint never ate in this game  Chuh 
Like I aint never seen or had me some big thangs
Like I aint been around the world and with so many different girls
And kinky parties that it could lift the spirit of Rick James  Jesus 
Like I aint a fixture and never knew Twista
And never did music for the Alpha Dog picture
Like I never script the pledge in the scripture
Or had a hit song bout my own liquor mixture
Do it like I wasnt a starter that was on the Carter  Weezy 
Wasnt in art of my cousin the Water  Fizzy 
Nothing was bartered were bussin and touchin the heart of
People thats lovin the hardest stuff aint no charted  Pleasies chuh 
Like I never got signed  Woah 
Not a one not a two but three times  Chuh 
Like I never did get the cheddar or see shine
Like its sleep time for peeps minds on T9
Like if these rhymes  What  really never ever happened  Chuh 
Til right now like pow I got it crackin
With the pen and pad without no back end
Tryna stack and get action
And pull the cash in is the way that Im rappin
Like I aint rich like I aint sold
Not a neer record Platinum or neer Gold
Like I aint dripped like I aint froze
Like I aint made a quarter mill for a show
Like I aint big like I aint huge
Like I aint shit like I aint pay dues
Like I aint full like I aint cool
Like I aint build a empire in the Zou
Like I like I aint
Toured with the Jay Rock with the homie KDot
Like I aint never had the allure for the pay slots
Stressin like I didnt step in the session with the Seven
Never guessin the effin cure is to spray thoughts  Brrt 
Like I never had a shot  Pow 
Or a song with the white guy Dre got  Woo 
Like I didnt have LA locked
Never went on the set of Ballers with Mr Baywatch  USO 
Like I didnt meet Trav yet like I never had assets
Bad with the pen but never cashed checks
Rappin like I aint even close to havin the bag yet  No 
Like Im tryna be the best up in this hiphop  Chuh 
And do a track with the king of Atlanta TIPtop  Chuh 
Then turn around and go switch it up and do big rock
Tryna ride all the way up to my homie in Slipknot  Maggot chuh 
Like I never heard fans yell it
Not The Calm not The Worst even Anghellic  Word 
Before they told me that I cant sell it
Before I went to the reunion of fam Nelly
Like I didnt have this new watch  Chuh 
And it never would tic and never do toc  Chuh 
Like Im rapping myself into learnin brew hops
Rappin like I aint never did a record with 2Pac
Like I aint rich like I aint sold
Not a neer record Platinum or neer Gold
Like I aint dripped like I aint froze
Like I aint made a quarter mill for a show
Like I aint big like I aint huge
Like I aint shit like I aint pay dues
Like I aint full like I aint cool
Like I aint build a empire in the Zou
Like I like I aint
Skippin my job yeah  Yeah  like this is a process
Tryna get from the projects so I spit like I got next  Woo 
And I trip if you object  Yeah  like Im itchin to fly Tech
Whipping in kitchens with Pyrex  Woo  to the mission that God set  Yes 
For me rippin these quick and will not rest
Like no flippin Techn9cian is obsessed  Chuh 
Like I didnt know when I was droppin  Chuh 
Independent music I wasnt toppin  Chuh 
And all the bad bitches wasnt jockin
I rap like I didnt know Id do a record with Hopsin  Chuh 
They call me Tecca N9na Ima shoot this
If youre dissin you really dont wanna do this
Niggas wanna try me then youre gonna lose it
I rap like I never did a record with Joyner Lucas  Hungry 
Like I never knew maestros
Like I didnt know Trae was a asshole
Like I didnt have a stash full of cash flow
Rappin like I am back in the past with my afro
Like I never ever knew Strange
Would put the name Tech N9ne in my shoe strings  Chuh 
Like I didnt know I was spittin the butane
And I grew fame with the homie Bobby and 2 Chainz
Like I aint rich like I aint sold  Yeah 
Not a neer record Platinum or neer Gold
Like I aint dripped like I aint froze
Like I aint made a quarter mill for a show
Like I aint big like I aint huge
Like I aint shit like I aint pay dues
Like I aint full like I aint cool
Like I aint build a empire in the Zou
Like I like I aint
