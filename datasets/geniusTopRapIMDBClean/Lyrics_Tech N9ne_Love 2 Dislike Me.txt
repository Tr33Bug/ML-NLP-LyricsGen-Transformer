Love 2 Dislike Me Lyrics
I am your fool
Loving you, I shouldn't
You take me, chain me
I have nothing anymore

You want a regular dude, but you think that I'm what you need?
You gonna get in your mood, wanna bitch in every text you read
Sometimes I think I wanna let you breathe, but I'm the enemy if I set you free
I gotta let you know that it gets to me, ready or not like a refugee
You complaining when I see you
That I never have time, that I'm busy as a beaver
Foul face when i feed ya
Really need hennessy, that be my fucking reliever
Why you wanna stand and cry the most
Are you thinkin' that Iâ€™m for you to try the coke
To knot the hole, really wanna tie the ropes
Say by default and hang Nina by the throat
You must really like my imperfections
Cause you stay on dismay, temper detections
And thats nightly, too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts, but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
What did you ever see in me?
Was I only what it needed be?
I'm running away from your judgement
Don't you try to find me
I won't let you change me anyway, anyway

Yo, I'm feeling stoned now
Sick of having those breakdowns, they gone now
It's on now, I've grown foul, it's wrong how we've shown clouds
You keep your tone out of my dome, gal
I'm sick of this shit
All the picking and the pulling, I don't dig it a bit
Living and learn what I want and what I'm giving 'em living 'em digging a ditch
Dick I wanna fit up in this
You stayed out of my premises
But you ain't supposed to be my nemesis
Wanna be in to kiss, never to finish it
What happened to close friends with benefits?
I'm mad as hell
Cause I wanna be back when we had it well
All this static's problematic like grabbing a rabbits tail
And thats nightly, too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts, but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
You might also like
What did you ever see in me?
Was I only what it needed be?
I'm running away from your judgement
Don't you try to find me
I won't let you change me anyway, anyway

Inside I wanna find somewhere I can hide
Away from all the faded dreams and tainted lies
I wanna tear you up and love you all at once
You quit and score so give me more
Give me more, give me more

Don't tell me everything's okay
I'm only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me
Don't tell me everything's okay
I'm only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me

You point out all my imperfections, but yet you stay
That's nervewrecking
I can't live this way1Embed
