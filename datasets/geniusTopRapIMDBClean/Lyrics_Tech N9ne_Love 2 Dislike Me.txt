I am your fool
Loving you I shouldnt
You take me chain me
I have nothing anymore
You want a regular dude but you think that Im what you need
You gonna get in your mood wanna bitch in every text you read
Sometimes I think I wanna let you breathe but Im the enemy if I set you free
I gotta let you know that it gets to me ready or not like a refugee
You complaining when I see you
That I never have time that Im busy as a beaver
Foul face when i feed ya
Really need hennessy that be my fucking reliever
Why you wanna stand and cry the most
Are you thinkin that Im for you to try the coke
To knot the hole really wanna tie the ropes
Say by default and hang Nina by the throat
You must really like my imperfections
Cause you stay on dismay temper detections
And thats nightly too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
What did you ever see in me
Was I only what it needed be
Im running away from your judgement
Dont you try to find me
I wont let you change me anyway anyway
Yo Im feeling stoned now
Sick of having those breakdowns they gone now
Its on now Ive grown foul its wrong how weve shown clouds
You keep your tone out of my dome gal
Im sick of this shit
All the picking and the pulling I dont dig it a bit
Living and learn what I want and what Im giving em living em digging a ditch
Dick I wanna fit up in this
You stayed out of my premises
But you aint supposed to be my nemesis
Wanna be in to kiss never to finish it
What happened to close friends with benefits
Im mad as hell
Cause I wanna be back when we had it well
All this statics problematic like grabbing a rabbits tail
And thats nightly too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
What did you ever see in me
Was I only what it needed be
Im running away from your judgement
Dont you try to find me
I wont let you change me anyway anyway
Inside I wanna find somewhere I can hide
Away from all the faded dreams and tainted lies
I wanna tear you up and love you all at once
You quit and score so give me more
Give me more give me more
Dont tell me everythings okay
Im only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me
Dont tell me everythings okay
Im only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me
You point out all my imperfections but yet you stay
Thats nervewrecking
I cant live this way
