Welcome to Missouri where the killers pop it off
And when I say pop it off I mean
Deadly with the tongue or the gun
We can do it if anybody want it rather rapping
Or get to clapping up another tell everyone
Misery Loves Kompany so we dump at thee
Enemy when it be energy sendin me the route
Of negativity trippin with me you runnin for your life
Cause you ran your mouth  Mouth 
We can sang or we can bang
It aint no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it aint no thang
Midwest Choppers 
Yerm sayin we livin in pain
And its a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man stay in your lane
Midwest Choppers 
Sang or we can bang
It aint no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it aint no thang
Midwest Choppers 
Yerm sayin we livin in pain
And its a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man stay in your lane
Midwest Choppers 
Finna witness the murderous monologue of a menace
Comin from out of a sinister formidable place
I can let you know the ins and the outs
And I can spit it wicked twisted
And you can see by the look of my face
Gimme the mic and Ima mangle it tangle it
Definitely the people see that I got the hang of it
Pity you gotta try to make a mockery of a city who
Block em and block em buck at you baby we dangerous
Came to get strange with it bang with it
Stop and get a little untame with it
Get to choppin like Im fully a bully with a hoodie
Should he get up and take em out or spit caine with it
Well the answer is right before your eyes  who do you despise
Killers who chop you we got to stop you
Pop you partner you gushin
Get up outta the way when Tecca Nina be bustin
Gotta give it up Im a veteran like Edison
Ima light em up and get in your head again
Im better than ever never let a feather in death he be fetishin
Sever it hit the mic and then we peddlin medicine
Im a chopper chopper chopper
Automatic kickin the ammunition
Killin the competition no it aint nobody
Hotter hotter hotter
Damagin everything and everybody
You know we on a mission listen to me
How can I make you understand Im a general
Even if you poppin the competition is minimal
Kancity killers and you can bet that we criminal
The demon inside of me keep on tellin me when to go
So Ima keep reppin the midwest choppers freakin flows
And Im bout to be up on top of this and truly be bustin
Beggin for mercy you punk I aint givin you nothing  nothing 


We can sang or we can bang

Lyrically we be the best in the Midwest and we caked up
I aint talkin about women Im talkin about paper
DLoc and Dalima enter the center
And get coded and when in the competition we for sure to kill em
I spit like a fully and ready made through any type of weather
With the Beretta tucked right under my sweater
And we hotter than lava
The way that my gillas be keepin it poppin
Partner you tight but my gillas are better
We keep it choppin like a blender eatin boys up for dinner
Guillotines we chop your heads off and throw em out the window
We too critical we ill and you walking away looking so pitiful
The AGT we be the number one contenders
When it come to the street we still post on the block 
40 Cal on my lap and my middle finger up to the cops
On the way to the studio to go and make another hot track
They be lovin the way that we spit it when we drop
They call me DLocsta the Vulture the definition of a soldier
My opposition is more culture than Rocha
I spit like a Tommy and anybody in my way Ima fold em
And me and my gilla gorillas want it cause we the coldest boys
Be tryin to battle cause they want our position
But they can never get in it because we better and bigger
And like I told you we the number one competitors dealin
Workin their way up to the top and they wont stop til they get the millions
In a whole nother century the DLoc and Dalima
Chemistry you can never cross with them
Igganas idah the ebe ossinbay the yricala
Iggertra eavela otherma uckerfays lost
You can try to read us you can try to beat us
Try to get your speed up but it aint gon matter
Cause after we get finished bustin there aint gon be no laughter
We takin over the map with Tecca Nina the master  master 
We can sang or we can bang
It aint no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it aint no thang
Midwest Choppers 
Yerm sayin we livin in pain
And its a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man stay in your lane

Man stay in your lane
Midwest Choppers 
When Im off in a zone I get to representing the city of the K
Hollow your brain cause Im a disaster
Dalima get ridiculous if Im comin at you
Leave em in a predicament cause Im a style master
And Im not impressionable now just so you know
I make em sweat cause Im the best with the flow
Whenever you wanna flex we can go keep stressin your cold
And I bet I leave your neck on the floor
Midwest finna blow like  C4 with a low strike 
Cause the energy is the bomb
I can tell that youre fascinated by the way that we rhyme
And we glow like when the four strike with the fire
It aint nothin you can say though 
Cause Im sipin on Henny and bustin like a semi on enemies now
Irritated with the haters that be coming around
So Im kickin like a relevant but an arrogant style
Meaning that Im really sure so
Im too sick for a cure so
Aint a need for a doctor
My verbal word play be making your nerves shake cause I caught you
Pants down when I popped you
Now lets take a trip through the valley of real gill
Strange individuals with a militant ill skill
Pop a collar and holler at the broads with real skrill
Get down for the cause cause we flossin big wheels  what up with it 
Dont be acting like you get tough with it
When the choppers come out the truck spitting
All of the Strange gill killas gon be devoted to leavin your body smokin when really you cant get up with us
And thats game thats proper 
Cause whenever Im bustin its like a full heart stopper
Dalima Tecca Nina Kaliko and DLoc
Rippin em up with the flow cause were Midwest Choppers  choppers 
We can sang or we can bang
It aint no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it aint no thang
Midwest Choppers 
Yerm sayin we livin in pain
And its a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man stay in your lane
Midwest Choppers 
Sang or we can bang
It aint no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it aint no thang

Hey Tech watch this
Kali Baby you better act right get right
Cause Im the baddest nigga hookin up with the fastest badass
Thatll hit you with the lyrical lyrical miracle whip incredible
Bout to knock the head off of several
Diggydiggy down watch em figgy frown at the ccclown
Them hounds is bound for your town diggydiggydiggy
And if you lookin for the sound
It can be found by the nigga wearin the crown
Are you really with me
And when you hear it nigga then zip it
The exhibit make you wanna reposition your pivot
When we write it and spit it we makin somebody get it
And if they wont hear it and deal it but forget it to get it  Stop 
Or I can keep babblin on
Or rattlin off at the mouth while we travelin
And Ill be thinkin it all be speakin about the things that I be doin
A couple scooping up out my mouth this album bout to ruin
You and you and you
And I can stop with the drop of the Caribou
And if its on and poppin its due with you and you
And I wont hesitate to chop you when chewin you
Uh huh while they doin you
And if you lookin for the better in the veterans who can bust
You got the Kali gun for fun
And if you throw we bustin back at you when you attack
Im on the track I hope they puttin down the gun
Dalimas a chopper  Chopper
DLoc a chopper that Tecca Ninas a chopper 
The Kaliko will knock your block off
You never see it coming hit you when we were gunning
You running we walk off  We walk off 
Cause its more than bread that were wanting  We flaunting 
And we comin headhunting
No we wont stop til we get to the top
You in the way then we midwest chop ya  Chop ya
