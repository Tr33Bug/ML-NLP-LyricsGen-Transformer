Midwest Choppers Lyrics
Welcome to misery, punk!
We deep rooted in this, y'all hear what I'm sayin'?
KCMO! KCK!
Yerm sayin'? It's how we do it
Tech N9ne in this piece
Strange Music represent! What!?

Welcome to Missouri where the killers pop it off
And when I say pop it off I mean
Deadly with the tongue or the gun
We can do it if anybody want it, rather rapping
Or get to clapping up another, tell everyone
Misery Loves Kompany so we dump at thee
Enemy when it be energy sendin’ me the route
Of negativity, trippin' with me, you runnin' for your life
'Cause you ran your mouth (Mouth)
We can sang or we can bang
It ain’t no game we untamed
Whether it’s fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain’t no thang
(Midwest Choppers)
Yer'm sayin', we livin' in pain
And it’s a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man, stay in your lane
(Midwest Choppers)
Sang or we can bang
It ain’t no game we untamed
Whether it’s fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain’t no thang
(Midwest Choppers)
Yer'm sayin', we livin' in pain
And it’s a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man, stay in your lane
(Midwest Choppers)

Finna witness the murderous monologue of a menace
Comin' from out of a sinister formidable place
I can let you know the ins and the outs
And I can spit it wicked, twisted
And you can see by the look of my face
Gimme the mic and I’ma mangle it, tangle it
Definitely the people see that I got the hang of it
Pity you gotta try to make a mockery of a city who
Block 'em and block 'em, buck at you baby we dangerous
Came to get strange with it, bang with it
Stop and get a little untame with it
Get to choppin' like I'm fully a bully with a hoodie
Should he get up and take 'em out or spit 'caine with it?
Well the answer is right before your eyes - who do you despise?
Killers who chop you we got to stop you
Pop you partner, you gushin'
Get up outta the way when Tecca Nina be bustin'
Gotta give it up, I’m a veteran like Edison
I’ma light 'em up and get in your head again
I’m better than ever, never let a feather in, death he be fetishin'
Sever it, hit the mic and then we peddlin' medicine
I’m a chopper, chopper, chopper!
Automatic kickin' the ammunition
Killin' the competition, no it ain’t nobody
Hotter, hotter, hotter!
Damagin' everything and everybody
You know we on a mission, listen to me
How can I make you understand I'm a general
Even if you poppin' the competition is minimal
Kan-city killers and you can bet that we criminal
The demon inside of me keep on tellin' me when to go
So I’ma keep reppin' the midwest choppers freakin' flows
And I’m 'bout to be up on top of this and truly be bustin'
Beggin' for mercy, you punk I ain’t givin' you nothing (nothing)

We can sang or we can bang
It ain’t no game we untamed
Whether it’s fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain’t no thang

And it’s a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man, stay in your lane

Lyrically we be the best in the Midwest and we caked up
I ain’t talkin' about women, I’m talkin' about paper
D-Loc and Dalima enter the center
And get coded and when in the competition we for sure to kill 'em
I spit like a fully and ready made, through any type of weather
With the Beretta tucked right under my sweater
And we hotter than lava
The way that my gillas be keepin' it poppin'
Partner you tight, but my gillas are better
We keep it choppin' like a blender, eatin' boys up for dinner
Guillotines, we chop your heads off, and throw 'em out the window
We too critical, we ill and you walking away looking so pitiful
The AGT we be the number one contenders
(When it come to the street we still post on the block)
40 Cal. on my lap and my middle finger up to the cops
On the way to the studio to go and make another hot track
They be lovin' the way that we spit it when we drop
They call me D-Locsta the Vulture, the definition of a soldier
My opposition is more culture than Rocha
I spit like a Tommy and anybody in my way I’ma fold 'em
And me and my gilla gorillas want it 'cause we the coldest boys
Be tryin' to battle 'cause they want our position
But they can never get in it because we better and bigger
And like I told you we the number one competitors dealin'
Workin' their way up to the top and they won't stop til they get the millions
In a whole 'nother century the D-Loc and Dalima
Chemistry, you can never cross with them
Igganas idah the ebe ossinbay the yricala
Iggertra eavela otherma uckerfay’s lost
You can try to read us, you can try to beat us
Try to get your speed up, but it ain’t gon' matter
'Cause after we get finished bustin' there ain’t gon' be no laughter
We takin' over the map with Tecca Nina the master (master)
We can sang or we can bang
It ain’t no game we untamed
Whether it’s fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain’t no thang
(Midwest Choppers)
Yer'm sayin', we livin' in pain
And it’s a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man, stay in your lane
(Midwest Choppers)
Sang or we can bang
It ain’t no game we untamed
Whether it’s fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain’t no thang

Yer'm sayin', we livin' in pain
And it’s a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man, stay in your lane

When I’m off in a zone, I get to representing the city of the K
Hollow your brain ‘cause I’m a disaster
Dalima get ridiculous if I’m comin’ at you
Leave ‘em in a predicament 'cause I’m a style master
And I’m not impressionable, now just so you know
I make 'em sweat, cause I’m the best with the flow
Whenever you wanna flex we can go, keep stressin’ your cold
And I bet I leave your neck on the floor
Midwest finna blow like (C4 with a low strike)
‘Cause the energy is the bomb
I can tell that you’re fascinated by the way that we rhyme
And we glow like when the four strike with the fire
(It ain’t nothin’ you can say though)
‘Cause I’m sipin’ on Henny and bustin' like a semi on enemies now
Irritated with the haters that be coming around
So I’m kickin' like a relevant but an arrogant style
Meaning that I’m really sure so
I’m too sick for a cure, so
Ain’t a need for a doctor
My verbal word play be making your nerves shake cause I caught you
Pants down when I popped you
Now let’s take a trip through the valley of real gill
Strange individuals with a militant ill skill
Pop a collar and holler at the broads with real skrill
Get down for the cause, cause we flossin' big wheels, (what up with it?)
Don’t be acting like you get tough with it
When the choppers come out the truck spitting
All of the Strange gill killas gon' be devoted to leavin' your body smokin' when really you can’t get up with us
(And that’s game that’s proper)
‘Cause whenever I’m bustin’ it’s like a full heart stopper
Dalima, Tecca Nina, Kaliko, and D-Loc
Rippin' ‘em up with the flow 'cause we’re Midwest Choppers! (choppers!)

We can sang or we can bang
It ain’t no game we untamed
Whether it’s fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain’t no thang
(Midwest Choppers)
Yer'm sayin', we livin' in pain
And it’s a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man, stay in your lane
(Midwest Choppers)
Sang or we can bang
It ain’t no game we untamed
Whether it’s fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain’t no thang

Yer'm sayin', we livin' in pain
And it’s a shame that you
Came and got drained and listen
Man, stay in your lane

Hey Tech, watch this!
Kali Baby, you better act right, get right
'Cause I’m the baddest nigga hookin' up with the fastest badass
That'll hit you with the lyrical, lyrical miracle whip, incredible
'Bout to knock the head off of several
Diggy-diggy down, watch 'em figgy frown at the c-c-clown
Them hounds is bound for your town, diggy-diggy-diggy
And if you lookin' for the sound
It can be found by the nigga wearin' the crown
Are you really with me?
And when you hear it nigga then zip it
The exhibit make you wanna reposition your pivot
When we write it and spit it, we makin' somebody get it
And if they won’t hear it and deal it, but forget it to get it (Stop!)
Or I can keep babblin' on
Or rattlin' off at the mouth while we travelin'
And I’ll be thinkin' it all be speakin' about the things that I be doin'
A couple scooping up out my mouth this album ‘bout to ruin
You and you and you
And I can stop with the drop of the Caribou
And if it’s on and poppin' it’s due with you and you
And I won’t hesitate to chop you when chewin' you
Uh huh, while they doin' you
And if you lookin' for the better in the veterans who can bust
You got the Kali gun for fun
And if you throw, we bustin' back at you when you attack
I’m on the track I hope they puttin' down the gun
(Dalima’s a chopper) Chopper!
(D-Loc a chopper, that Tecca Nina’s a chopper)
The Kaliko will knock your block off
You never see it coming, hit you when we were gunning
You running we walk off (We walk off)
'Cause it's more than bread that we're wanting (We flaunting)
And we comin' headhunting
No we won’t stop ‘til we get to the top
You in the way, then we midwest chop ya (Chop ya)
