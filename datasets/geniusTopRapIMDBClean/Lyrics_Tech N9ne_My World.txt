In a world of misery
Within this three planets collide
Brotha Lynch Dalima Tech N9ne
Bring you along for the ride
Wait a minute Im from the West Coast Conference
Like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me the King of the Valley
All I need is a game jersey
Nigga nuts and guts get served up
When I get it Ill spit enough aim sturdy
Cut it up gut it up with cold cuts
Wit a oven that heated up came dirty
Ill be off of that kryptonite
Turn em into liquid ice stain his jersey
Leave em in the back of the El Co
Like Helter Skelt stick it to em like velcro
Nigga Im a bitch killer
Ima dig a ditch quick to rip ya
Paint a murder picture witcha
Im a jack knife strip ya that night
Split your legs open and dick you
With the 9 milli ithaca rippin your guts
Eat ya meat the deep heat deplete you with the meat cleaver
Then I didnt see you either
Four quarter receiver court order delete you
Tech ordered the meat Im bringin the seasonage
And a suicide note doordie locc
Hes in the backseat cut necks some sexist
Bout to get him that Brotha Lynch Hung necklace
Expect this
Welcome to my world
Where hearts are broken and bars
Are open potions pullin me closer
Welcome to my world
Darks my ocean my Ark is floatin
But not livin like Im supposed to
Welcome to my world
Where hearts are broken and bars
Are open potions pullin me closer
Welcome to my world
Darks my ocean my Ark is floatin
But not livin like Im supposed to
Lyrical asylum 
Cause I be Dalima motherfuckers hatin me for the longest
Could it be critical cause Im lyrically flawless
And if Im heated I cannot be mentally cautious
Diggin the pain  I get deep peepin the flame
Only can I be held accountable for makin the change
To whatever regards are gonna be  Insane 
In the middle of a stage Im bustin like a 12Gauge
You can never bring it to a nigga thatll hang you up
Slip a couple mickeys up in your drink for you
Homicidal with the fullyloaded rifle and undecided of
Whether or not I can cut up your brains or guts
I get spaced out sometimes 
And its like Im a heathen whether or not you believe it
Everytime I rap a motherfucker stop breathin
Have you ever been in a dilemma for a reason  Nah 
Well let me introduce you to the crucial upliftin future  and then 
Recruit you and seduce you to the mutual group of  My friends souls 
Nigga you better get ready cause
We done put together the fettiest chemical frame
Energetic when I let it embed it in your brain

Fight this phantom your freakin family will fall flat
Bunk Biancas beat em black and blue with a baseball bat
I might be a small cat but I wont use discretion
Hit em wit a weapon if he steppin wit a mall rat
Twenty minus eleven I make em all scat
Not prosperous now Techs not with his crowd
Hes lost in his clouds
Rather be offed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But Ive been broke so I might swipe your cheddar
You better get ready to give me I got a vendetta
Comin to get it whether weed or money whatever
Nobody said it was gonna be easy people deceive me
Or leave me in the dark and buried off in Necropolis
One day you gon see on me TV you better believe me
Takin over this and never the opposite
Rewrite my life gimme light inner fight for whats right
Allah Liberate Cuidado
151 Rum is how we run from slim sums then comes Diablo
I need a medic cause I murder energetic
In the cerebellum never tell em I got
One of the worst problems in the medulla oblongata
You oughtta go in one hell of a shot
No more darkness how did I start this
Feelin bizarre shit like kickin your carcass
I am the ruler in my kingdom and my dark seats hot
Step into my world and your heartbeat stop
