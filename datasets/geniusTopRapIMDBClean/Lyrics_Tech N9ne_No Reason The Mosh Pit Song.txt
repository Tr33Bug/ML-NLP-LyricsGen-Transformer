No Reason  The Mosh Pit Song  Lyrics
We are legion
This Tecca Nina in yo arena
We saw no reason
Yeah start shit
For no reason mosh pit
For no reason our shit
For no reason the hardest
For no reason start shit
For no reason mob shit
For no reason mosh pit
For no reason mosh pit
I just think you fuckin with the wrong one
Times like this I dont know how to have fun
I think Ima fuck somebody up  Fuck em up 
You gon need someone to hold you up
What the fuck
My city stand up
Stoppin people that got animosity and what
Copying me and the property poppy ya jammed up
Were akhis that can bust dont mock me the brands us
Strange Music the gang shoot this right at the fakers
That came stupid with the claim
Youll get took for your change and name usage
Steppin to me link with Atlanta you losin definitely
Ready for ruckus really we reppin the B  ah ah 
This the eviction notice missile him quick then go get
Hitters consider me and my niggas be sick and roguish
Stop you aint ready to brawl you cant hang
Lock hit you dead in the jaw you claim Strange
It aint K tell Kan City to jam with me
You damn sissy eat up the object that stands stiffly in my pants with me
Never honor who bringing drama to the Don if you continue
Not gonna do what I common do guess what Ima do
Start shit
For no reason mosh pit
For no reason our shit
For no reason the hardest
For no reason start shit
For no reason mob shit
For no reason mosh pit
For no reason mosh pit
Lets get to it 
I just think you fuckin with the wrong one  The wrong one no 
Times like this I dont know how to have fun  I dont know 
I think Ima fuck somebody up fuck em up  Gunna 
You gon need someone to hold you up  Hold you up huh 
What the fuck
Look its only one option  White  you gon need a doctor
I aint talkin bout the one from Compton
Arms feet legs all gone like Im Don Corleone
Hiring James Bond thats what Im on
Remain calm but aware that Im armed and dangerous
See double Xs and know that the gang with us
So hang tight Im trying to get this right
You think cause I wrote a pop hit that I wont pop shit
The fucks wrong with you PopTarts
I pop cherries and popstars you popsicles is not hard
Popped in on the top charts out the cop car
To remind yall you just rap youre not Gods
And I dont care who got bars
Because they dont acknowledge mine so show me who got scars
Show me the greatest on the stage and the arena
Bet they point they finger up at the Gunner and Tecca N9na
I just think you fuckin with the wrong one
Times like this I dont know how to have fun
I think Ima fuck somebody up
You gon need someone to hold you up
What the fuck
She will not leave a bunch of passes
I just wanna see that ass yeah
Caribou Lou in my glass yeah
I start a riot by accident
Somebodys bitch showin ass again
I should start throwin some cash again
Pushing the crowd we harassin them
If you start makin me mad I
Start shit
For no reason mosh pit
For no reason our shit
For no reason the hardest
For no reason start shit
For no reason mob shit
For no reason mosh pit
For no reason mosh pit
We are legion
We saw a reason
