Niggas in Mizzou aint changed
Make ya have to let loose thangs
Have you ever seen a MAC11
New TEC9 with the extension
HK AK47
Mayday man down call the reverend
I put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings
I felt like they tone said Im comin to get ya
Well thats when all of the heavy artillery come in the picture
And luckily cause of your past you can have someone assist ya
I was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga
I swore to never let a mans hands take me to my grave nigga
With my fortune Ima get to torchin like Orkin I spray nigga
I know they dyin to get it with the N9ne
Thats fine they wanna make a nigga do the woop
So Ima take the carbine and put it to ya mind
Its goin through you not around ya like a hula hoop
Put that on the bible if ya fuckin with Tech get the rifles
Totally trippin tryna take my title lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel
If you psycho you can do this if he chooses to be foolish
The gun never loses never give you the deuces
Nigga this is SuWu biz ahh
Let me calm my nerves Ima simply put this on the word
If ya hella aggravated cause of a song ya heard from the N9na
I smoke a nigga like my ganja herb
Im on the verge no life beyond the surge
When I bomb ya served what does one deserve
But a head stompin now put ya teeth on the curb nigga
Have you ever seen a MAC11

Mayday man down call the reverend
I put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings

Ayy fuck all that goin back and forth with a nigga
Got a problem what he really wanna do
If you know like I know then you know true
And niggas make songs but they really dont do
What they say got guns but they really wont shoot
He afraid Ill lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete nose to the ground
Do him in the streets fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around its enough
Eat a bullet from the fourpound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off Ill believe you aint soft
Otherwise nigga you just soft as all them other guys
Ill kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Dont listen to these niggas they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns Shot em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low all my niggas headed for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF
Thats your business nigga none of mine
I know Young Gotti bout what he rap bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around two weeks had a whole ki
Just cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead
Like disco then a nigga went and showed me
Guess what Im tryna say is nigga I dont know you
And futhermore pussy nigga I dont want to
