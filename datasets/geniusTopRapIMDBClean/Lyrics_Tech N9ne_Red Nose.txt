Thats real people act a different way with me
I feel dont nobody wanna play with me
And thats ill cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my red nose
I got my face painted crazed aint it
That a black dude lookin like he got a white tattoo
People thinkin that he way tainted by evil
Treat you like fecal wanna beef you when they meet you
People perceive you to be lethal when you aint seethrough like tissue
I feel like the industry givin me vivid stupidity
When they distribute these fictitious sissys
When I rip it so serious and wickedly no forgivin thee
When I claim were Strange
Everyone tellin me Im insane were bane
Im an independent talented individual workin
But the industry is the reindeer game
And they call me Rudolph the Red
They know I dont rip a mic but I chew off the head
Spit it at the PDs and DJs and VJs who be gay
You fakin you get threw off a ledge
If you tough we snuffing
Homie trust me nothing
Is worse than knowin youre beautiful
But get treated like an ugly duckling
So Im Rocky Dennis but Im so polished nothin can stop me in this
Bad in the brain and the good is not replenished
The fakers who imitate me and mock me  finished
We check the mill yes its real
Through Strange I dont need ya major label record deal
Thats real people act a different way with me
I feel dont nobody wanna play with me
And thats ill cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my red nose
They tend to stray away from me because Im different
And its been this way with me ever since I was an infant
Other kids were jealous
They say that the look up off in my eyes seem hellish
Never knowin later in life I would relish
The thought of me ballin livin my life and sell it
I blame it on program directors go and request us no damn selector
But if you got a lot of dough man they blessed ya sure can depressed ya
When you knowin that it aint nobody better mane
Stuck off in the cold when the bad weather came
Now they gotta see me livin it up and cheddar gain
Comin from the forever pain to it never rains
So I throw up the finger to everybody who got a tow up demeanor
Thinkin that Tecca N9na was sho nuff a dreamer
But the flow is so heavy it could show up Katrina
Now its time to take it and you all must face it
Tech N9na is sacred
All of you hatin fakers couldnt see me with LASIK
Red nose the leader so follow
You gotta be ready to get up and go is the motto
Made it through everything negative bravo
The money thats comin to me feel like I won a lotto
Now Im bout to put the slay on auto
Swoop down on the DJs
Tell em all to quit the replays
Make em put Tecca N9na in the Serato
Thats real people act a different way with me
I feel dont nobody wanna play with me
And thats ill cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my red nose
Im comin and drivin my short bus
With this nose I dont need a torch up
Bustin through like the industrys por chop
Comin after who didnt support us
Rip down its bleachers
I blew up cause my sound is aether
Underground up and found this creature
Not scared of a nigga with clownish features
Im makin a name outside your mainstream
Real it wasnt an insane dream
From the beginnin I really came clean
You about to see Strange gleam
Take it over and gain green
Strange Music and RBC along with Fontana we gon change things
Now its so funny cause with money I can fly away
Or leave them haters off in the deepest darkest hideaway
Why do they do me wrong My music truly strong
Because Im different all you cowards wanna shoo me gone
Yes this is Strange year worldwide fames near
But the games queer
Sometime I feel like Im Rudolph the Reindeer
And the music they said blows is on top and the cred grows
Youre gonna have to open up the door for the bro with the red nose
Thats real people act a different way with me
I feel dont nobody wanna play with me
And thats ill cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose red nose
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my red nose
