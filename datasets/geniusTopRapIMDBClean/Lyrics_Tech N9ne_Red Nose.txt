Red Nose Lyrics
That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose

I got my face painted, crazed, ain't it?
That a black dude lookin' like he got a white tattoo
People thinkin' that he way tainted... by evil
Treat you like fecal, wanna beef you when they meet you
People perceive you to be lethal when you ain't see-through like tissue
I feel like the industry givin' me vivid stupidity
When they distribute these fictitious sissys
When I rip it so serious and wickedly, no forgivin' thee
When I claim we're Strange
Everyone tellin' me I'm insane, we're bane
I'm an independent, talented individual workin'
But the industry is the reindeer game
And they call me Rudolph the Red
They know I don't rip a mic but I chew off the head
Spit it at the PDs and DJs and VJs who be gay
You fakin' you get threw off a ledge
If you tough we snuffing
Homie trust me nothing
Is worse than knowin' you're beautiful
But get treated like an ugly duckling
So I'm Rocky Dennis, but I'm so polished nothin' can stop me in this
Bad in the brain and the good is not replenished
The fakers who imitate me and mock me â€’ finished
We check the mill, yes it's real
Through Strange I don't need ya major label record deal
That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose

They tend to stray away from me because I'm different
And it's been this way with me ever since I was an infant
Other kids were jealous
They say that the look up off in my eyes seem hellish
Never knowin' later in life I would relish
The thought of me ballin', livin' my life and sell it
I blame it on program directors, go and request us, no damn selector
But if you got a lot of dough man they blessed ya, sure can depressed ya
When you knowin' that it ain't nobody better mane
Stuck off in the cold when the bad weather came
Now they gotta see me livin' it up and cheddar gain
Comin' from the forever pain to it never rains
So I throw up the finger to everybody who got a tow up demeanor
Thinkin' that Tecca N9na was sho' 'nuff a dreamer
But the flow is so heavy it could show up Katrina
Now it's time to take it, and you all must face it
Tech N9na is sacred
All of you hatin' fakers couldn't see me with LASIK
Red nose, the leader so follow
You gotta be ready to get up and go is the motto
Made it through everything negative, bravo
The money that's comin' to me feel like I won a lotto
Now I'm 'bout to put the slay on auto
Swoop down on the DJs
Tell 'em all to quit the replays
Make 'em put Tecca N9na in the Serato
You might also like
That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose

I'm comin' and drivin' my short bus
With this nose I don't need a torch up
Bustin' through like the industry's por' chop
Comin' after who didn't support us
Rip down its bleachers
I blew up 'cause my sound is aether
Underground up and found this creature
Not scared of a nigga with clownish features
I'm makin' a name outside your mainstream
Real, it wasn't an insane dream
From the beginnin' I really came clean
You about to see Strange gleam
Take it over and gain green
Strange Music and RBC along with Fontana we gon' change things
Now it's so funny 'cause with money I can fly away
Or leave them haters off in the deepest darkest hideaway
Why do they do me wrong? My music truly strong
Because I'm different all you cowards wanna shoo me gone
Yes this is Strange year, worldwide fame's near
But the game's queer
Sometime I feel like I'm Rudolph the Reindeer
And the music they said blows is on top and the cred grows
You're gonna have to open up the door for the bro with the red nose
That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose15Embed
