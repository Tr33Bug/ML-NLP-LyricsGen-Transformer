This this this this one of them ones
Yeah Tech N9ne
Turn me up a little bit more Ben so I can rock this the right way brother
If you got 2020 vision
You can see Nina handling this music with precision
If not then its fine with me
Just know this movement is vivid enough for the blind to see Yates
How in the hell can you miss me
When Im counting my mil making histry
Trip the splits be that 5050
So we rip the script swiftly and zip through chips quickly
When the trash mail and pizza man see me
They get a fever and cheesy when they see the man Neezy
Im easily beast and my hand is in my belt
What Im independent and Im feeling myself
A flunk I wont be
I bumps the trunks see
The ladies pop the monkey and drop the donkey
They want to flaunt me
My songs be funky
Steady getting that cheddar forever
But some people acting like they dont see
Im top dog something like a CEO
Im calling shots call it Don Julio
But they dont really see me though
But they dont really see me though
All night life like a video
Prime time something like a Super Bowl
But they dont really see me though
With contact lenses say he dont smoke
Im rolling up and let the contact get him
He even choked
My approach was to never to be broke
Kept my real niggas close
Now the player turned to coach
I hear people saying why so many changes
Why so many watches Why so many chains
Im mixing Kush with all these different strains
Riding in my Porsche listening to Purple Rain
So much knowledge I came up on you just a Hollywood insider
The inside of my crib look like a gym
Speaking of gym Im in the game youre just a bench rider
You ride the bench that mean you aint playing
You understand hella fans
Bunch of hands hundred grands thats the plan
Wizzle Man
Im top dog something like a CEO
Im calling shots call it Don Julio
But they dont really see me though
But they dont really see me though
All night life like a video
Prime time something like a Super Bowl
But they dont really see me though
Im truly blessed
I do request for all of you people to listen
I do see checks and movie sets
And never been a stranger to vixens
Pick up the pen its in my gut to win
I got a motive and Im in it with a mission
You know what Imma get it when I dip into it
Ive been through it Ive been a fighter with a vision
You can cover your eye brother but why
Cause your lady just discovered that my
Big rubber defies your lover blubber
So you utter replies with a tougher disguise
Cause my payday done caught the nose of your lady
Im at the beginning of my hayday
Yall better Wrekonize like Mayday
I dont know why jokers just wont let their eyes notice
Deep in my vocals they keep yelling that Im doper
And ill choke ya if your lips deny flow
So just buy jokes
You know couldnt see me with bifocals
Im top dog something like a CEO
Im calling shots call it Don Julio
But they dont really see me though
But they dont really see me though
All night life like a video
Prime time something like a Super Bowl
But they dont really see me though
