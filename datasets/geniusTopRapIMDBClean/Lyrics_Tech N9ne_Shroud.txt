I cant breathe anymore
Ive gone the distance
Cant see me anymore
The darkness has overcome
I dont wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now its dripping all over me
We on the surface be hell raisers
We crave good life but born into this deadzone
Ive searched for answers from my female maker
In the cemetery but they never produced her headstone
Black as ever like Shabba
Thick and oozing like lava
See this room with my Prada dadda
Mustve came from my father
Cause my mama was an angel
But this thang grow insane bro  Insane woah 
Swallowing sound
This is darkness accumulated
Over the years and heartless buffoons that made it
Over to here on the TV
Cops kill a man cause hes trying to buy a BB Gun  BB Gun 
Whats gonna happen when they see me come
Really run  Really run 
Swallowing sound
Im bout to just boom
Take the madness
Let it explode and shake the masses
Shroud that I carry here to break the rabbits
And awake the maggots
I hate your habits  I hate your habits 
Your evils consuming me
Now my heart and brains together in unity
Darkness
Cause aint no opportunity


I cant breathe anymore
Ive gone the distance
Cant see me anymore
The darkness has overcome
I dont wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now its dripping all over me
They say my metamorphosis made a monster
In so many ways this statement might be true
Your plan right from the start was divide and conquer
So what do you think I see when I see you
Give me your wishes
Give me your hitlist
Bring all the wicked
Im bout to show you Im vicious
Ligaments and Srirachas delicious
No stopping for tickets
Dont make me give the crooked coppers the business
Coppers the business
Swallowing sound
I look suspicious
Wearing your anger
During your danger
Swearing whore wrangler
Dont let me close to yall
If you touch it its like an overdose of Propofol
I be the ghost to all
That wanna vote for hogs
I got a goat to maul
Goat to maul 
Swallowing sound
Licking my lips ow
Burn my tongue
I need a germ to come kill me
In worms and dung lay stagnant
Im an avid mad lad
See the evil I grab it
Stick to me like a magnet
You can have it
You can have it 
Rack Imma clack on they asses
Brack Brack Brack
Give the evil no passes
I cant breathe anymore
Ive gone the distance
Cant see me anymore
The darkness has overcome
I dont wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now its dripping all over me
If I told you my energy is so strong at times its force can move things would you believe me
