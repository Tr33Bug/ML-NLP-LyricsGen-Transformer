Hey now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit  get the fuck out
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit  get the fuck out
For those who love raw shit  welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is Tech N9ne
This is style I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick monotone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern bust out that quick Middlewest chatterin
Some people hate but it aint matterin
But the people gather its flatterin
Switchin the pitch mixin theres no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission full bliss when I be rippin this shit
Make it exciting got to be inviting when youre writing your piece
Never be dick riding if youre going to be biting youre igniting the beast
This is melodic melodies if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales you singin offkey its garbage
If you cant keep an octave in a pocket you need to stop it
Have confidence speak with conviction
Dont put em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony Ninas taking you through it
Make it buttery utterly beautiful make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session I thought you knew it
We murderin motherfuckers in music thats how we do it
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Such an oddity with it this is Sickology
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat

From our West Coast instructor Crooked I
My killer cadence can keep me crushin the competition
Comin correct when creatin the crazy composition
Cannibal character Calico carrier got a crooked copper missin
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty  if Im thirstay
I change the pronunciation of words per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap this is how  this is how 
Right now Im puttin swag in my style  in my style 
Its an emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give em charisma with a laugh and a smile  and a smile 
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example this song is a war zone and you listeners in the crossfire
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Such an oddity with it this is Sickology
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
From our East Coast instructor Chino XL
Everybody start lockin their windows and doors
Chino might get in
Its like lightning and how Im strikin a triflin rifleman
Bullets flyin up and Im numbin the bum like its Vicodin
So much metal in his spine he could get rich from the recycling
Chino be curdlin blood dont get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love industry hate me yo
Id rather hear Hannah Montana than half of you rappers on the radio
Startin drama with Chino God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay thats God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery like I drive a coroner van
Im demented spittin writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin and fittin to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin Sickology try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Browns fist in the face of Rihanna
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
Get  on your feet  up  out your seat

Get  on your feet  up  out your seat
