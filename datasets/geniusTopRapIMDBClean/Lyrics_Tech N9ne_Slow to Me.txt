Dumb it down No gunit sound
If I took that advice it wouldnt be nice Id be plummetbound
So Im bout to clown like Kinkodistinct flow
Thatll shrink yo remains of yo peebrain people if you think slow
Hit the staccato flow 
Listen and follow me this how it ought to be
Audibly quality call it the KOD it be modesty but if Sickologys
Hot as me spit no apology
Keep going 
Flipping bidiness it is not a free policy
If I spit it then it gotta be dollars we
Up and get it I be fucking livid if you keep Donnies economy
Double time 
Not too many wanted me to spit it with the syllables
A nigga that be critical the pinnacle and givin that original
A killa with the trigga flow and really wanna get the billion in it low
Play the bongo 
If you dont wanna speed it up Im gonna eat it up
Everybody see Im formidable
Im coming to heat it up I gotta beat it up
When I get the booty she comin to get it from a real negro
Beyond bomb the women need pompoms
When I get to rippin they want to get little Don Don
To give up the John John before we get to sippin the Chandon
Free my nigga Ron Ron for real
Back to the nigga with the fast flow havin the cash though
Cause if anybody got it Im on the mash fo
And I bet Im gonna beat em cause they ass slow yep
But they never get it til you spit it slow

Dude you dupeass dude rapduelers are douchebags
Cause every rapper thats on the radio sound the same
And its troublin me I be like Whos that
Then they came to abuse trap music and you wack
Like they on the same level as me and cant see the huge gap
Between us Im too fast my lyrics just flew past
Im a thousand kilometers up ahead of the others
Shit Im writing so over your head that it hovers
And this is for anybody that ever said fuck us
Let me slow it up a little bit and maybe theyll love it
These rappers these days be like
If I could rap like this I might get radio play  Get radio play 
But just cause you sound like you crackin with autotune that shit dont make it okay
Fuck that Stealing creativitydont give it a go
Tryna kill like BusaBus then Ill gimme some more
Tongue flick fast like RavenSymon make her lick on the lady pussy makin her moan maybe Im wrong
To me your bars aint hard and your song too slow
You will never get to have this charm logo
Goddamn we a threeman band
Tech gave em the bongos I give em a guitar solo like
Youuu tryna pretend that I aint
Better than 98 percent of these emcees but any minute I annihilate
In a heartbeat sooo many will sleep when I wake
Fuck a magazine the shit that you write your internet site
Cause all the shitty records you post up I hate
Cause that shit sound slow to me
Yeah
Hahahaha Strange Music baby
Truly elite shit Hahahaha
I mean if you cant keep up
I dont know what to tell you its slow to me
Haha and if its too fast for you
Chop and screw that shit or something
