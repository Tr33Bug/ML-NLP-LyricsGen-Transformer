Speedom  Worldwide Choppers 2  Lyrics
I get to bustin like Im a thirty ought six
When Im rippin the beat up but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him purty hot  Cheah 
Cause he knowin that Tecca Nina the dirty chop  Cheah 
Hes handle holmes heres a handful
How in the hell he hoverin havin hella go ham though
I said to Seven Richie Havensll be the man
So we put it together thinkin Eminem was a gamble  Cheah 
Guess not cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said What we doin  I said to him Lets chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked  Cheah 
Never be another choppers comin so lets rock nigga  Cheah 
Youre on people got to wonderin if its a for sure song
Yes I got another killer makin a tour strong
If you thinkin of battlinuh youre gone
Nobody can catch him he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if you got your feet in your mouth
You gon have to beat it up out of him
Its a lot of em and I mean a lot of em
And me and Nina used to follow them
Ive got to audibly body them
This is it man the hitman the Ip Man karate em
And if fans will lift hands well get dancin out of em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of em
Who stands with two hands up movin the crowd of em
If I aint makin sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It aint ever been a gift for me to heat em
I beat em I burn em  Then I let em melt 
They never heard of us but look at em turnin up  Uh 
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton make em be impotent
If and when I be flippin niggas be feminine  Okay 
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions Im livin in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast or Ill smash on a nigga
With half the cash Im a little sicker quicker than you figure
Ice cold  I make em shiver bigger than the winter
If you halfass deliverin Ima eat your dinner  Yum 
Better than mine oh no not me I mean other guys  Okay 
I jump around so do that mean that Im rubberized  Okay 
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
Well bleed em beat em til they be gone feed em
Speedom  If you wanna go with us 
Speedom  Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom  I must be the one to bust 
Speedom  And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Speedom  If you wanna go with us 
Speedom  Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom  I must be the one to bust 
Speedom  And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Sometimes  Go  I feel  Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Sometimes  Go  I feel  Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Wait Fore I wreck this beat let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills
Of ecstasy pills next to me in the seats spilled
Or she eat em all with a breakfast drink  You inspect the sink 
Im in the habit of grabbin a mic and babblin I dabble in Vics
But I might just swallow my fuckin Ritalin tablet after tonight
Im grabbin it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause thats what its like and attackin it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pentup inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured Id try to set a big enough fire
Thatll trigger the sprinkler system
And Id escape but the getaway driver
Screwed up my limo collided with the center divider
I went through the window
And ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guys wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
Cause when I pick up a pen Im venomous
And Im as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
Youve been yellin dementedness
I invented this Im the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin smart alec degenerate I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy envious
Of female independence hell with a clitoris hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
Ill never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in thisll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity that Im thinkin about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
To make em picket I pick a day to be a prick
Then Im pickin the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level incredible
Head full of Red Bull unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away Uhuh not today
Murder you on a song and then Ill just say
I was with Dr Dre and Robert Blake eatin lobster steak
And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just gotta make sure that our stories corroborate
Im a lot to take like Kanye walkin up on the stage
For Beyonc like its my job to say
That youre not a real artist but its my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way you will not escape
Ammunition replenished the Punisher
With his gun insured hundred words
In a clip other words motherfuckers better run
If youre not lookin to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one dont wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the
Speedom  If you wanna go with us 
Speedom  Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom  I must be the one to bust 
Speedom  And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Speedom  If you wanna go with us 
Speedom  Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom  I must be the one to bust 
Speedom  And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Sometimes  Go  I feel  Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Sometimes  Go  I feel  Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Im the fury the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin fright
I flick it on fire finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall Im floggin a foe with a fife
Never forget it I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it you trippin to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict whos havin to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil I put up a fight up in the industry
Pedal to metal we givin the light a lot of energy
We reppin beat checkin he that be Koba
If hes the evil enemy itll be over
Running you down in front of your town
You ever makin fun of the clown Im gunnin you down
We doin it under the ground a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound no onell be found bitch
Would never be choppin without Slick Rick
I got it from the record Lick the Balls and this dick
If you never listen to me you musical misfit
Nah cause every time I be droppin I get bit
Im hearin a lot of rappers they tryin to spit quick
But the Middle West got em and we kill em in this bitch
If you aint in my circle of choppers you missed it
Cause me and my nigga Twista rule itand this it
Speedom  If you wanna go with us 
Speedom  Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom  I must be the one to bust 
Speedom  And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Speedom  If you wanna go with us 
Speedom  Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom  I must be the one to bust 
Speedom  And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Sometimes  Go  I feel  Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Sometimes  Go  I feel  Go 
Like Ill never slow down
