Speedom (Worldwide Choppers 2) Lyrics
I get to bustin' like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him purty hot (Cheah)
'Cause he knowin' that Tecca Nina the dirty chop (Cheah)
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though?
I said to Seven, "Richie Havens'll be the man"
So we put it together thinkin' Eminem was a gamble (Cheah)
Guess not, 'cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, "What we doin'?" – I said to him, "Let's chop!"
So now the people finally get three of the best locked (Cheah)
Never be another chopper's comin' so let's rock, nigga! (Cheah)
You're on, people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer makin' a tour strong
If you thinkin' of battlin'—uh, you're gone!
Nobody can catch him, he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if you got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em, and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
This is it, man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And if fans will lift hands, we'll get dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands up movin' the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em
I beat 'em, I burn 'em (Then I let 'em melt)
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up (Uh)
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton, make 'em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine (Okay)
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm livin' in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast, or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half-ass deliverin' I'ma eat your dinner (Yum)
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys (Okay)
I jump around, so do that mean that I'm rubberized? (Okay)
Me and N9ne master, meaning we murderize
We'll bleed 'em, beat 'em 'til they be gone, feed 'em!

Wait! 'Fore I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills
Of ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled
Or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink (You inspect the sink?)
I'm in the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in Vics
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after tonight
I'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like, and attackin' it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pent-up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver
Screwed up my limo, collided with the center divider
I went through the window
And ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
'Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You've been yellin' dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate, I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious
Of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity that I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
To make 'em picket, I pick a day to be a prick
Then I'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level, incredible
Head full of Red Bull, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away? Uh-uh, not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake, eatin' lobster, steak
And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just gotta make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take, like Kanye walkin' up on the stage
For Beyoncé, like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher
With his gun insured, hundred words
In a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the—
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)

Sometimes (Go) I feel (Go)
Like I'll never slow down
(Worldwide Choppers)
I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you trippin' to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's havin' to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Pedal to metal, we givin' the light, a lot of energy
We reppin', beat checkin' he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Running you down, in front of your town
You ever makin' fun of the clown, I'm gunnin' you down
We doin' it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch!
Would never be choppin' without Slick Rick
I got it from the record "Lick the Balls" and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, 'cause every time I be droppin' I get bit
I'm hearin' a lot of rappers, they tryin' to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em and we kill 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista rule it—and this it
