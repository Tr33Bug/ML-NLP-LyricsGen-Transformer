Jesus 
Yeah yeah hell yeah
Yeah yeah hell yeah
Yeah yeah hell yeah
Yeah yeah hell
Froze over when you thought you could hold Yoda
With flows older than the first sold cold soda
Grow more for my bros those rojo soldiers
Them cincos are at it again blow doja
I am like Iron Mike back in the day
My rhymings iron height defiant flight
Try and bite like a razor in a candy apple
A taser in a jammy tackled
By a neighbor with the family shackles
Laboring a man hes gaffled
I get angry I sip bombs  Chea  on your rich lawn
I was brought up Muslim and Christian
I been studying Chrislam  Chea 
Thats not a thing so I place this John
In your chicks palm
Give her something beautiful to kiss on
Til I spit one to her lip balm  Chea 
Ive been rhyming since Reagan in politics
Polished it then got a big wallet where all of my dollars sit
To the wall is split then I gotta sick the casa your god exists
Cause a lot of chicks holler Mr Chopper youre hot as shit
Ah
They say Im the best at what I do
After me its 5 4 3 and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin
So I tell them all to put that on somethin
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Yeah I guess Im supposed to come with that fast flow
Woo I guess Im supposed to come with that gas flow
But no Ima just spit it Ima get it good
Wish you would tell me what I should do
I dont know hit the door
Uh yeah feel like I been here before
Maybe I have but I cant fuck with it
Hit em with a semiautomatic watch em duck with it
Speaking on lyrical ability
Everyone in my vicinity blowing they mind like Kennedy
I got no love for the enemy somebody tell me the remedy
Im like whats good been fine
Tell me whats on your mind rewind this shit
My message is beyond this shit
I put that on everything Im just being honest shit
So whats up hold up
Tech Im sorry for the holdup but I been on the road
Should have had this verse to your ass a long time ago
When I put that on everything I aint had a minute to myself
But I been living like I aint finna see tomorrow
I aint focused on no wealth
I been living good I been feeling fine
Pass the sriracha I put that shit on all of mine
Busting like Columbine combined with a terrorists mind
Thats been confined to four walls for some time
They say Im the best at what I do
After me its 5 4 3 and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin
So I tell them all to put that on somethin
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha the flavor popper
We gotcha even haters jock us
These choppers invade the knockers then blocker
Disintegrating every chakra eager to off ya
You can bet that we doin it proper
When I put the bullets in a fully with a hoodie
Aint nobody gon stop us nobody gon top us
We leave em with no option and leave em with no conscience
Even though I can achieve it no problem
And even though I couldve seen what they watchin
TV with a DVD I can repeat what I see these streets jockin
Easy if it need be then I just eat beats
Like Im EazyE Compton I eat meat like Im EBT shopping
Credit Card max bend the bars back
Fuck your ho get brain and all that
Run in your house and bring your whore back
Sever your face and dead the doormat
Who got the keys to the rented Corvette
Cant catch me Im the man in all black
I been on that shit since Katt been on crack
Fuck that I been nice way before that
Cant ignore that you can try though
But you gon end up next to Dido
Im that pen that wrote the Bible
Im on your skin like vitiligo
Sing for the moment I hit the high note
Someone please let Elton John know
Tell the lieutenant Im Hect Camacho
With a Catholic priest and the Pentecostal
Why yall niggas wiggidy wiggidy wack get a nigga in the back
With an umbilical patch jump in the middle of the track
None of you niggas can act so yall niggas are packed
Come and get it again fuckin a bitch in the whip
Give me your moment to fall Im gonna fit in the car
I can do better than yours I can be ready to brawl
I can be shattered and all nobody want to be hard
Better be ready for war tell me who ready for more  Joyner 
They say Im the best at what I do
After me its 5 4 3 and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin
So I tell them all to put that on somethin
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
Sriracha I put that on everything
