Together we are a powerful force as one mind body and soul
Let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce us because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love combined with our strength we ward off pain and stress
Technician I am wholeheartedly in life and in death
Okay I get it Im an FON Freak of Nature
But the pen is gonna heat the paper
Was a problem in the incubator
Mom and dad was a creature maker
I never need the shaker
The beat from tape were the teacher later
Now youre the beast awakener
I dont think the streets are safer
My misery seepin through my delivery
Bitter we givers and they keep my figures dont try to nigger me
The grave digger is hither he is no kidder see
Consider the dark energy sinner be inner me
Black diamonds all around callin all the down definites
Who saw the clown and now steppin with that tall amount of big Tech and shit
Aahooh  3 times  Aahooh aahooh 
My people they know what that defines
What the people are lovin and thats T9
He rhyme and make em make a beeline
They bout to hate make out the great
They mouthll break if they dont pay off the cake
Stay out my face you dont want me to lay out the fake
Flip the sick and pray thou relate
That Im incredible straight out the gate
We are the darkness but were leaving
We are the gods that are deceiving
We are the painters of blindfaith
We are the children of your rivals
Holding guns while reading Bibles
Go ahead and seal your fate
Straight out the gate
You see the face of EBAH on Tech N9na
Evil Brain Angel Heart I remain in the dark and anointed
With holy they console me when they know we
Sin got a hold of me why they let go of me Im double jointed
Im wicked and I represent the sickness
All you fraudulents feeling Im falling offending the father
I place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss
Nobody but you and without any food and no agua
I blackened the sun on you bitches
Sat in the dungeons and ditches
Yappin is one of your glitches  halt it
The Kraken has come with the quickness
Back and Im plundering chicks
And laughing you dummies trip with Exalted
Tech N9ne
Fuck the industry independents we enemies to them and he thats blind
The champ is here the vamp is near
Huntin you heathens hella hungry and Im amped this year


We are the darkness but were leaving
We are the gods that are deceiving
We are the painters of blindfaith
We are the children of your rivals
Holding guns while reading Bibles
Go ahead and seal your fate
Straight out the gate
I am the public enemy 1
Fuck your fame I became the name of a gun
Now they parents hate Aaron because they sons
And daughters wanna be martyrs believing in my art aint it young
All I got is my balls and rap
Im appalled that yall want me to fall calling craps
Suckers hate it now they crawlin back cause Im tall as Shaq
And Im always up for brawlin bats
Strange Music saved my life
I was fuckin it then the music became my wife
Nobody on this planet can tame my mic
Call me crazy dont matter fucking insane I like
When the suns beam melts
Everyone screams help
Then only one kings felt
When telling all survivors welcome to Something Else 
And I say Kansas City
Will always stay Kansas City
Yeah
This is Something Else baby
Lets Go
We are the darkness but were leaving
We are the gods that are deceiving
We are the painters of blindfaith
We are the children of your rivals
Holding guns while reading Bibles
Go ahead and seal your fate
Straight out the gate
I aint knockin no more Im breakin in
