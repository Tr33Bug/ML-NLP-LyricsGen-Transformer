Strangeulation I
Hmm Tech N9ne
Smashes the masses but the industrys hatin asses
Strange days when your favorite rappers poppin
But Is he on top Is something you cant gauge
Especially when hes toppin the charts
And you see me K Lamar and Macklemore sharing the same stage
Im the nigga all these artists look up to
Yet for Tech its been the hardest to bust through
But I keep my fans fiendin like clucks do
You dont like how we living well  Fuck you 
I dominate your conglomerate want a beating I can accommodate
Itll be a nondebate coming up against Aaron the Great
So many got arms legs and necks tatted Strange
Cause music show conceptually Im the best at it
Lets have it for all of these Tech addicts
Any disrespect to family will get your chest gatted
Aimin at em and its agony
Burner blew his brain in back and these
Cannons came and caved in cavity caliber connect cap it
Yo there it go red is in my head it grow
Headed fo lead and deaded yeah the medic said it so
Let it grow shred it and get no credits so pathetic though
Dread embedded steppin in heavens crevice wet and edible
Give her the shivers when I deliver this
Hit her then quit her cause shes on Twitter shit
And when she compared me to Eminem I said Im different
She said How I said Im black and I can say nigger bitch
To him I may be just another bro with a flow
Well probably never tour cause itll be thousands of Juggalos at his show
And I heard fatalities happened on each side so thats never no let it go
So I get it I keep what Im makin incredible all of them scared of a negro
Strangeulation this occupation so scandalous
We stop the hatin no chances
When I rock the nation so Danzig
Im killing all these niggas Operation Code Kansas
Strange gang plain triggered assassins
Got a bunch of untamed aimed trained spitters a blastin
My insane brain sayin Give up the rappin
And go back to the gang bang thang nigga whats happenin Soowoo
