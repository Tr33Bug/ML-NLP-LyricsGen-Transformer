Strangeulation Vol II Cypher I Lyrics
Smoking weed
True indeed
Sick emcees presented by
Tecca Neez Check it out
Aint nobody busting like the nigga with a gun up in the middle of the west
I be the killa with a TEC and Im a villain with a vest I gotta fill em with effects then I get it out the way
So I can say what I wanna say
Right over the track singing like the father of Nona Gaye
Lets get it on they love it when Tech spit a song way rugged
And check niggas on they grudges then death shitted on they buzzes
That was just the intros for the family with sin souls
But the Gandys with the fem flows cant stand me like ten toes
I rock it making my female fans freaking faucets
Put me up against Hop is thoughtless not supposed to press partners stop it
Cant compete compare crotches cockless taking Tech is too toxic toss it
Never will the bosses take losses
Study cautiousness off this shit
Cause some fans are antagonistic
Naggin bitches raggin like a stabbin happened when Im havin hits
Get massive sick shit like I aint Vlad and vicious bad and twisted
Keep it jabbing fisted Trav insisted
So I frown scarier when the clown buries a nigga down to the ground but the crown carrier
Get the hound out the mound and theyre bound marry em all together is how we breaking the sound barrier
Im threedimensional we invincible you saying Im over you never see the principle
My seed is meant to grow rapid Im the classical rap shit on acid
Bastards  Hurl bars  Never will niggas be able to gimme the trash it
Jacket  World star  How in the fuck am I ripping and reaching the masses
Asses faggots too many back splashes
Then a wack black chat hatches cause you napped at rap classes
They making a mockery of my painted face
But me I resemble our ancestors
And these niggas talking stuck at a fainted pace
Still not realizing this man blessed ya
I am so clever my friends adore me they banging Yates
Your rhyme is no measure to him you bore me gay flaming fakes
Find him more cheddar my ends for me stay gaining great
Cause I am forever like Em 40 Jay Wayne and Drake
Pure art Im the shit and nigga youre farts
How they gonna challenge the Tecca N9na when your flows softer than a Velour scarf
Blowing this track into pieces Im leaving you fewer parts
At this moment I am laying as dead as before my 20 tour starts
Aint packed shit yet this how your taint rap hits best
Tecca N9na aint plastic my banks drastic you cant match his checks
Lot of gore in the flow and Im born to go got your whore in the door
Taking your chick cause a nigga been up on the Forbes list now four in a row
My religion is followed by little kids
College kids metalheads hip hop heads the rips and soowoos
Your religion is tainted by money grubbing
Funny hugging chummy loving grown men that like to do youths
So I stick with my technicians
No Fs given yeah this team is a mixture of a few groups
This for my fans nigga fuck everybody else
If you loving this Tech N9ne give me three aoohs and two whoops
