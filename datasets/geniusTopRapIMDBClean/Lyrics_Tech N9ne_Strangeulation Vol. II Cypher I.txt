Strangeulation Vol. II Cypher I Lyrics

Smoking weed
True indeed
Sick emcees, presented by
Tecca Neez! Check it out

Ain't nobody busting, like the nigga with a gun up, in the middle of the west
I be the killa with a TEC and I'm a villain with a vest, I gotta fill 'em with effects, then I get it out the way
So I can say, what I wanna say
Right over the track singing, like the father of Nona Gaye
Let's get it on, they love it when Tech spit a song way rugged
And check niggas on they grudges, then death shitted on they buzzes
That was just the intros, for the family with sin souls
But the Gandys with the fem flows, can't stand me, like ten toes
I rock it, making my female fans freaking faucets
Put me up against Hop is thoughtless, not supposed to press partners, stop it
Can't compete compare crotches, cockless, taking Tech is too toxic, toss it!
Never will the bosses take losses
Study cautiousness off this shit!
'Cause some fans are antagonistic
Naggin' bitches, raggin' like a stabbin' happened, when I'm havin' hits
Get massive sick shit, like I ain't Vlad and vicious, bad and twisted
Keep it jabbing fisted, Trav insisted
So I frown scarier, when the clown buries a nigga down to the ground, but the crown carrier
Get the hound out the mound, and they’re bound, marry 'em all together, is how we breaking the sound barrier
I'm three-dimensional, we invincible, you saying I'm over, you never see the principle
My seed is meant to grow rapid, I'm the classical rap shit on acid!
Bastards! (Hurl bars) Never will niggas be able to gimme the trash it
Jacket (World star) How in the fuck am I ripping, and reaching the masses?
Asses, faggots, too many back splashes
Then a wack black chat hatches, 'cause you napped at rap classes
They making a mockery of my painted face
But me I resemble our ancestors
And these niggas talking stuck, at a fainted pace
Still not realizing, this man blessed ya
I am so clever, my friends adore me they banging Yates
Your rhyme is no measure to him, you bore me, gay flaming fakes
Find him more cheddar, my end's for me stay gaining great
'Cause I am forever like Em, 40, Jay, Wayne and Drake
Pure art, I'm the shit and nigga, you're farts
How they gonna challenge the Tecca N9na, when your flow's softer, than a Velour scarf?
Blowing this track into pieces, I'm leaving you fewer parts
At this moment, I am laying as dead, as before my 2.0 tour starts
Ain't packed shit yet, this how your taint rap hits best
Tecca N9na ain't plastic, my bank's drastic, you can't match his checks
Lot of gore in the flow, and I’m born to go, got your whore in the door
Taking your chick, 'cause a nigga been up on the Forbes list, now four in a row
My religion is followed by little kids
College kids, metalheads, hip hop heads, the rips and soo-woos
Your religion is tainted by money grubbing
Funny hugging, chummy loving grown men, that like to do youths
So I stick with my technicians
No F's given, yeah, this team is a mixture of a few groups
This for my fans, nigga, fuck everybody else
If you loving this Tech N9ne, give me three aooh's, and two whoopsYou might also like11Embed
