Strangeulation Vol II Cypher II Lyrics
For what I wanted to do was take some of my classic beats and send em to my artists to see what they would come up with on these beats that I love so much so I wanna call Stevie Stone and Ces Cru to murder lets go
Feel the hate when they come around
Little bull better settle down
Feel the love Im the great and or the true
See the fakes and the snakes Im always outta bounds
See I been dealt a hand my nigga I can peep
Peeping the shifty fans my nigga
They gon  see  see me going HAM getting bigger nigga
Talk that shit if you want to hack my Tech N9ne play it again 
Make sure you remember me me the odd ball liquor
When Stevie get to speaking the plot
Thickens with and these niggas is Vixens
Competition its really contradiction  uhhuh 
Learning from the realest slim pickings
I love it how you doubt a nigga hound a nigga
Panned out all this profit sought the stone to stand stout
On rigid and rare routes its like procedure to hear a nigga out
Strangeulation two and its right now
Lets take it to another level hot metal black kettle bitch
High pitched fly shit falsetto five words like the bandit lord
I think this weed got me paranoid
Middle finger to my enemies I say all you niggas is bitches
Jurisdiction have so many restrictions
All you niggas is fiction no conviction
Niggas get to dissin Ill have you outta commission
Bodies missing call my brother to lynch em
All you niggas is gimmicks frail body and soul
All you niggas pretending thought that we socalled family
All you niggas can get it turning my volume up
Had us upon that midget
Let me hear you say names let me hear you holler Strange
Octane with flame will leave your bodies decaying
Niggas be playing games my niggas taking aim
Have you in a debacle better stay in your lane
Guess timell tell  guess timell tell guess timell tell 
Right hand over my heart of hearts Im pledging allegiance
To Ces for whatever the reasons I have withered the seasons
Theyre dead in the breeze Im ready to feed em
I never believed em you son of a bitch son of a preacher word of
Heaven and Jesus through seven degrees of separation is still
And spreading diseases my recommendation is cheddar your cheeses
Maybe you better get business like I didnt know that I carried the load
I know your boy is heavy and heaving
Thats word to Strange and Tech the N9ne I mean who better to lead us
Since I been with that team I been spinning them Gs
Bitch yeah you better believe it cash come in a bulk amount now
Im staying ahead of my dreams so the fuck could I sulk about
For real Ill never be satisfied still I dont be vocal out loud
Respect is due I show it dont blow it my records are outbound
Chill Im choosing my weapons wisely we never will lose direction
Guide em through the Recession Proof should include a confession truth
Started from the Bikini Bottom were here but its something fishy
Twenty sixteen Strange Music making some fucking history
I know they want me to put up the pen
And just quit with the rapping it wont never happen no
For the minutes that I been in it Im a killer still in the back but Im clapping though
In a matter of fact I been acting so
Out of wack and my brain is on overload
I dont call anybody aint nobody calling me
Maybe I dont need a phone no mo
Guess I wont pay the bill and the villain is spillin venom in him then Im a goner
And haters are catering to me with wishes that I wouldnt win any longer
Idiot youre just making me stronger wanna kill me then pay me no mind
Get a record thats quite a bit longer if you dont feel me then get on your grind
I dont mean to be mean but the measure is simple when you try to weather the outcome
Now I dont need a reason killing any season in fact I am better without one
You dont know anything about heat or the temp of the weather that Im coming out from
And I wouldnt consider you equal like other people where the fuck is your album
Shit to you is a hobby and obviously yall aint knowing to measure at all
Murdering it for pleasure aint fucking with Godi Im sick with a medicine ball
Couldnt give em a shit not even a little bit cause they haters we know it
We all know the location come get your face winched
Strangeulation reloaded  Fuck
