Strangeulation Vol II Cypher III Lyrics
Im proud to present this cypher to my technicians cause this one has been a long time coming
So I called on my big homie Big Scoob and my lil homie JL B Hood
Lets go
Yeah aha Big Fella
Back pushin that trap shit to your tracklist
Tecca N9nas new package Big Fella gon snap bitch
Whip game Im magic front flips no backflips
Ill eatin old passed whips looky here these facts bitch  yeah 
Big Fella yall know me man show me homie Im still the same
Im a little older got a little colder Im still a soldier Im blowing flames
Time to get whats happening blood
This dont get it Im acting up
Yall aint wit it then Ima go get it and ship it in in the back of the bus
Nah Im just fuckin with it bickin back and having fun
Bullshit Im having none pussy niggas best hold their tongue
Flip a switch and Im with the shit get to clapping clips and Im banging drums
Ignorant with this ignant shit and my only wish is you come get some
I told you bitches where the fuck Im from
Showed you this is where the luck might run
Out for the doubt
What you do witcha mouth about to be part of the reason I come and bust my gun
Finnicky front wanna be just like them
Niggas a boar be hunted just like one
This no war nor kid time son
Its a warning do nothing dumb
You can feel what it is when exposed to the Gs
A real one exists this close to the lead
Get ahold of the disk you suppose to believe
The show is a trip and the flows a disease
Coke gotta fizz got zones of the trees
Never let em live let alone let em breathe
Not a fuck I could give like fucks what are these
Pros we official the hos Lebanese
Strange got the game in a guillotine choke
Language aim seen finna be quoted
Know it aint my enemy hope
Swank if you cant consider me dope
Ya skank wanna grope me and Joey Cool both
On the bull with a 7 no Toni Kuko
Bitch checkin to whenever you post
They come out the woodworks know whenever you close
You know what Im yelling know somebody better tell em
Hardhead make a softass let me get em
Up in art class was the only time he drew a weapon
Up the bar blurred lines Im a urban legend
No TI TMI but Im fuckin with protection
Paperwork in red like Im makin a correction
Select what I said hope you makin the connection
We come at a nigga head it come off him in a second
Me and Tech got high said we finna do work
Spat hot lava finna shoot first
You expect not vibe I could only do church if
My nigga was alive I am in the booth hurt
Know that Ima ride why I tell em B Hood
You would look odd in my neck of the woods
If I really wanna slide in your ho I could
But Im God with a double O yall know Im good
Step like I should


I steps like a real should
Papered but still hood we whip it and feel good
Ayy we makin your bitches feel good
Yanked it and still could we whip it and feel good
I steps like a real should
Papered but still hood we whip it and feel good
Ayy we makin your bitches feel good
Yanked it and still could we whip it and feel good
