Insanity at its finest
Fire starter
Riot maker
Moon stricken
Animal need
Bad seed
Untamable  Beast 
Everybody around me always thinks they know whats goin on inside my mind
Think Im Mr Nice Guy all the time
How they say on Diary you think you know but you have no idea
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor
Come against me thats a no no yo
Cause Im a beast
I can smell your womens rosey poonany on the dance floor all the way in VIP
Im a rapper I can snatch her
And she will leave with me because of my stature
Now everybody move everybody bounce
Who ever the N9na choose we about to pounce  work it out 
With the 151 in my bottle

I like all women tall women and small women
You got to let Tech Niz tease your chakra
Species release freaks please the monsta
Petit beast feez these Gs will rock ya
Handcuff her buster dont trust her

When your lover say Tecca N9nas a brother
She tryin to say that I rushed her then crushed her
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor
Come against me thats a no no yo
Cause Im a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor
Come against me thats a no no yo
Cause Im a beast


Im out to get that money like a robbery
Now I got it all my enemies wanna clobber me
Squalor be harder we need dollars camaraderie
The hotter these collars be the larger the lottery
Need them tens twins
Gotta succeed spend Gs Ben Franks
We cram cheese in banks
Breed sin we win thanks
Hungry like the wolf indeed but I give
Money to my crooks that need I live
In Sherman Oaks but from Kansas City
I miss home Cali is business but man its pretty
I aint lyin yall monster for money for mine yall
If I wasnt gettin money Id do time dog
Youll never see the N9ne fall
Big house wood floors maid cleanin the bitches with PineSol
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor
Come against me thats a no no yo
Cause Im a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor
Come against me thats a no no yo
Cause Im a beast
Friend this industry is no kin to me
Behold the flow of the century
But they scared of me
Rappers they dont compare to me
Fair to be said that they dares to be sincerely a rarity  Wow 
Check the SoundScan look around man
Wake up look at your Jacob you in killa clown land
Face paint and Juggalettes with bubble butts
And we rockin plus the Diddy women in the button ups
Hands down we rock harder than Kiss
But rap me Kutt and Krizz
But can I get two stomps and a clap in this bitch
N9na shot to the top cause I plots to get rich
Tell ya executive Im next for this
Success it is yep the best for Tech
This aint Baptist Pentecostal or Methodist
This is the Beast baby out I mean Exodus
Im mean and I will destroy you I am the Beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor
Come against me thats a no no yo
Cause Im a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor

Cause Im a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your floor
Come against me thats a no no yo
Cause Im a beast
