The Beast Lyrics
Insanity at it's finest
Fire starter
Riot maker
Moon stricken
Animal need
Bad seed
Untamable (Beast)

Everybody around me always thinks they know what's goin' on inside my mind
Think I'm Mr. Nice Guy all the time
How they say on Diary, you think you know but you have no idea!
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast

I can smell your women's rosey poonany on the dance floor all the way in V.I.P
I'm a rapper, I can snatch her
And she will leave with me because of my stature
Now everybody move, everybody bounce
Who ever the N9na choose we about to pounce (work it out)
With the 151 in my bottle
I call Hef, will he let me hit this model in the grotto?
I like, all women, tall women, and small women
You got to, let Tech Niz tease your chakra
Species release freaks please the monsta
Petit beast feez these G's will rock ya
Handcuff her buster don't trust her
'round these hustlers, homie don't be a sucker
When your lover say Tecca N9nas a brother
She tryin' to say that I rushed her then crushed her

Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast
You might also like
I'm out to get that money like a robbery
Now I got it all my enemies wanna clobber me
Squalor be harder we need dollars camaraderie
The hotter these collars be the larger the lottery
Need them tens twins
Gotta succeed spend G's, Ben Franks
We cram cheese in banks
Breed sin we win thanks
Hungry like the wolf indeed but I give
Money to my crooks that need, I live
In Sherman Oaks but from Kansas City
I miss home Cali is business but man it's pretty
I ain't lyin' y'all, monster for money for mine y'all
If I wasn't gettin' money I'd do time dog
You'll never see the N9ne fall
Big house wood floors, maid cleanin' the bitches with Pine-Sol

Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast
Friend this industry is no kin to me
Behold the flow of the century
But they scared of me
Rappers they don't compare to me
Fair to be, said that they dares to be sincerely a rarity (Wow!)
Check the SoundScan, look around man
Wake up look at your Jacob you in killa clown land
Face paint and Juggalettes with bubble butts
And we rockin' plus the Diddy women in the button ups
Hands down we rock harder than Kiss
But rap me Kutt and Krizz
But can I get two stomps and a clap in this bitch
N9na shot to the top 'cause I plots to get rich
Tell ya, executive, I'm next for this
Success it is, yep the best for Tech
This ain't Baptist, Pentecostal or Methodist
This is the Beast baby out I mean Exodus

I'm mean, and I will, destroy you, I am the Beast

Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast
Handcuff your hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin' your floor
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
'Cause I'm a beast8Embed
