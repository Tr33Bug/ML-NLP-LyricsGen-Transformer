And the road gets harder with flow spits
Cause we represent that Kansas city MO shit
Double doses Tech Kalikosis
But ran into a duo thats ferocious
Some of the best two kill you no rescue
They say that you gotta spit hot 16s before you step through
And they say everybody nigga even Tech do
Now we gotta explain our journey to the Ces Cru
Im on a pilgrimage to the rhyme Mecca because Im Tecca
And this mind left ya down at the bottom because N9nes better
And if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness
They in a mess bind yessir sever decay em Ima define pressure
Ima spit it for bidig roars and not a critic whore
Hit ignore I got acidic core Thidis war youre nada when it pours
Wanna plaay every daay staay for the waay that I spraay
Saay You got the paay Thats yaay or naay
Bumblebee tuna grrr
Dont be smelling like it if youre under me rumors
Will begin about you from hungry pooners
Hopin wishin prayin when youre gone itd be sooner
When Im dead Ima get up in the head of the nigga that set it up pickin the lead up then I wet em up look like a predator
Ima dead em and let it puss skip the peace it aint no humble we Luna
Moon stricken rednecks sayin Who them coons rippin
Boom  Pick em off
Take em off to my land in my van a lotta room getting in in
When I catch my flow try to wake up your style
But you fucked up like Uhoh Ima make up for it now
Its unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bare that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare any spared caring is barely there
Its unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bare that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare any spared caring is barely there
Its unfair
Who are these dudes We never lettin in any fools you know the rules
Kristopher egotistical narcissistic wit cha
If they sit on my throne then we tell em to get up and move and make us some room
I heard of these guys murderous when it comes to scripture
Ubiquitous and Godemis they Gods to us we Gods to them
So we meet right in the middle chewed the fat and fried up a little
And its unfair we got their hands in the air
And you cant even get a show
No one cares that your freestyle so rare
But dont nobody cant nobody know
And its easy for them physical favors
Why yall just spend all your paper
Breezes bend over the table tattoo symbols of my label
Driving and trafficking rhymes tongues sharp as African knives
We whats happenin to your wives while youre at nine to fives
You might as well stop rappin
Cause its not happening if I stop laughin
Cause its too hard to impress us just blatant disregard
The Four Horsemen of course we forced to be coarse when
You talkin taller when yall getting the short end


Its unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bare that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare any spared caring is barely there
Its unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bare that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare any spared caring is barely there
Its unfair
Its unfair to me nothing is what it appears to be
Killin off any and everything
Comin and threatening somethin thats dear to me
Ifn you feelin the fear then flee
Fi fo fee fum what a fuck up
Im retarded with a clover I guess you can call it dumb luck
When Im rappin out of habit Im adamant gettin adam
But I would rather hit a madam with a Magnum and split her atoms
Tryna fathom the famine that will diminish the anger
Got a place set at the table we eating spinach with Strangers
Sippin Caribou Lou
Spilling the sickest shit ever I tell em but who woulda knew it
Im one of two in the crew with a knife in my pocket and one in my shoe
Surrounded by haters so what Ima do
Thinkin I gotta devise a game plan
Get a ticket to kick it with Krizz and N9na
So I guessin Im headed to Strangeland
And my main man woulda told me to murk em
Doin the sin indeed Ima catch a couple more
Then Im formin a human centipede
Pause Im aware that they hatin look it they gotta diss
Who the fuck is fuckin with Tech Kali Ubi and Godemis
Its unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bare that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare any spared caring is barely there
Its unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bare that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare any spared caring is barely there
Its unfair
Its unfair to be doin motherfuckin charity
You can pay a fuckin fare for me
Or really there aint nothin there for me move carefully
I swear that we fly as a parakeet high as a Cherokee
In my rhyme I spoke like Jeremy feel my fire my smoke my kerosene
Wewewe dont want no drama wewe dont want no trouble
Wewe can keep it peaceful if yyall can keep it humble
II really dont know what he come fo
But his name is the same as a gun yo
Strangeland is a place that I seen in a dream
Since I was runnin round in my Umbro
And you heard it direct from my mouthpiece
Tech scouted me out then found me
Turn out we the perfect strangers Larry Appleton and Balki
I was out east when the text came in
With Tech sayin what is bout to be
Before you fuck me on the dough know that everybody round here lookin out for me
Now that we got that in the air I can feel the change in the atmosphere
My crew been living in limbo apparently all this rappin has trapped us here
And after years they hearin we lost inside the dream not necessarily
I wont let this rap thing bury me Ima let these bat wings carry me
