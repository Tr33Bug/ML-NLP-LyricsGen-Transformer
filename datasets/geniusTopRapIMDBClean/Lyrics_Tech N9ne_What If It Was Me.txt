Free your mind and remember
Winners are not people who never fail
But people who never quit
All I ever wanted was to sell
Records to the people make a lot of mil yessir
Rap to me it was the holy grail
Im gonna go and do it Im never gonna fail
Yeah but first I gotta make it out of Hell
Wake up and I see crime
All of us we on its eat time
My homies love me yelling Peace N9ne
At the same time throwing B signs
Throwing em back and repping the street Im
Doing music and Im writing beast rhymes
But my VSlimes had no weak minds
Got with the music started a group and we shine
Music gave us hella hope
Made it up outta the bangin and sellin dope
We were stronger than a bottle of Yoke
Til one of our members found a kid to grope
Then your honor gave the peddy the rope
Losing a man the band began to slope
Never did think a plan was damned to croak
So doing it solodolo stands the GOAT
Started making hella LPs
2000 all the way to five felt free
Because of the hand the label dealt me
But in 06 Fontana helped us smell cheese
Number one independent gonna be spending a ton of funds in a minute
Thats when the government want the sums then I send it
In a couple of months Im done and replenished
Everywhere I go Im selling out the show
Around the world I kill em and everybody know
Whenever we hit the studio
And Tecca N9na drop hot
Even though I will go toe to toe
If somebody bang on me but Im rolling in the dough
And Im really respected and protected
Chances of me getting shot not
Everyone loving the Tech
Publishin I get a check
Loving the cities that with me the people they call me the best
I dont have any regret but its a bit of neglect
Missing my babies I love em and none of em leaving me yet
Feeling good like a villain should
In a mansion but Im still in hoods
Not like Trayvon Js on
Khaki shorts and a red tee like I will and could
I can conceal it my permits say
If evil happens to swerve this way
Hope nobody deserves quick spray
I feel an angelic surge this day
They feeling my songs
Been doing it long
They want me to sell em my CD right outta my home
Cause Im in the zone
Im putting em on in front of the store when a couple of police wont leave me alone
Why they tripping
I fit the description
Its two of them rushing me Im on a solo mission
To get people to listen but they pushing and kicking me
Im on the ground when they telling me Cause of a gun suspicion
It was in my pocket aint trying to pop it
When they scared of a brother with a gun no one can stop it
Then one of em lost it and then I was shot quick
Officer took me to heaven Im dead and with multiple rockets
Didnt matter I was good and living inside a mansion next to ball players
Cause of the move he made was drastic now I lay in a casket carried by my pallbearers
Fears what I see making em kill a G
Rotten apple in the batch dont tell the rest to flee
This happened in Baton ROUGE even I fit the description
What if it was me


What if it was me
What if I never got the one chance to be
Everything and everywhere I go I wouldnt see
If by your hand you took that from me
But what if it were me
Laying right there
Ill never get up again its so unfair
My babies cry out
You never cared
Things that we do make each other so scared
So what if it was you there
Should I just  Take your life
Should I bust  Make your wife widowed withered hugging the pillow
The scent of you still on her
Spirit she feels on her
The whole world weeps
Blood we all spill on her
And I know its ill will the pills hard to swallow
How should I feel when Im being followed  Followed 
By the ones the should save me  Crazy 
They just save my life take my life
I gotta fight all of the night with cops crips bloods with sore fists
I gotta fight all of the night with cops crips bloods with sore fists
I gotta fight all of the night with cops crips bloods with sore fists
I gotta fight all of the night with cops crips bloods with sore fists and them Nazis
