Now Im known by the masses
Cause Ive grown to make them smashes
On this journey did many back flips
To get your attention now that I caught it
Who do I catch bitch
Real rock rap and not a Xerox
Weird not enough to make ya fear a lot from here watch
I ran scrimmage and I fought to the damn finish
And I popped eyes open without eating me canned spinach
My fans in it constantly tellin me I can win it
If I stand grimace damaging man every damn minute
I blended it expands quick it slams wicked rhyme
Grand spittage HAM with it fam dig its N9ne
Chea Hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles coming softer than a cats meow
Red laces but booted like Im Iraq bound
That frownll get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal pat down gat down back down blackout
With a fat smile I might react foul
So dont make this cat growl
I caught everybody when I spazzed wow who do I catch now
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who cant get with the rap sound
I caught the industry who do I catch now
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who told me to put the rap down
I caught the whole world who do I catch now
I caught wreck AND THEN I caught checks
AND THEN I caught press AND THEN I caught sex YES
And no permanent diseases were caught when I caught that
Now the games been offset cause Im strange in a lost mess
I caught a lot of shit being different they tried to hinder Tech
By calling him devil worshiper surfaced up on the internet
My temper gets grimmer just as winter sets Im a venter yes
And I cant forget when the finger pressed triggers I cant remember that
I caught stars attention N9na had a large ascension
So high the lord is squintin  NOPE  I mean yall are squintin  OKAY 
Cause Im tall as Pippen   NOPE  got a flawless vision  OKAY 
On a lawless mission  NOPE  cause Im ballish pimpin  YEAH 
Best believe I caught fades
Never homie soft made Im active no off days
And I got boss paid with music I caught babes
And I even caught gays before they all caught AIDS


Who do I catch now
Maybe those who cant get with the rap sound
I caught the industry who do I catch now
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who told me to put the rap down
I caught the whole world who do I catch now
I hit a pot of gold with the harder flow
You haters oughta know that we are the MO
This is my land you in my hand and yous a particle
And I see you marvel over the fact I caught Tha Carter IV
So that means I caught Martians already
And you talk shit about that because often yall petty
And because you jelly sicklin its costing yall Bettys
To get tossed in our headache cause we lost in tall fetty
Ayy you catch the vapors cause N9na he catch hoes
And you non believers are funny people like Seth Rog
Better pay attention cause if you simpin ya get froze
And Ima leave you with a wet nose when Im ripping they catch colds
When Im rippin they catch colds
Ay that make sense dont it Ben
Lyrically Im cold blooded
They be like ahahchoo
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who cant get with the rap sound
I caught the industry who do I catch now
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who told me to put the rap down
I caught the whole world who do I catch now
