I dont care
They say my angel glow is subsiding
Im sliding outside of these high beams and I wont dare
Try to mend this tear I love Im fading the good once there is just dying
So Im withering away and Ima trigger when I spray and Im attacking everybody til the feelings gone
All my life I loved with people
So passive back then I thought Id be above this evil
My tolerance level then was up with doves and eagles
Currently Ive hit ground zero under bugs and beetles
Im tilted inside my heads a lettuce but wilted
Serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine I spilt it
Could it be how many times Ive been ran over and jilted
That makes me wanna totally detach from light and just kill shit
Ill know when the pain is gone
Its just a matter of time before my pulses win
And I can feel the wrong
Coming up through the cracks of my heart again
Im holding on Im going
Straight into the mouths of makers everything that keeps me calm was taken
Im letting go Im burning through reserves are low
Just pushing on these old restraints my time is up cause its too late
Im about to blow up on anyone in my way
My angers set to show up at any time today
Im about to blow up on anyone in my way
My angers set to show up at any time today
I am looking for some fire yeah putting on my gang attire
Drooling and blood I can taste so get the fuck outta my face
Im a killer with a quick switch yeah all I ever really wanted was bliss
Look at me wither to waste so get the fuck outta my face
Find another one to get bent yeah and it aint no stopping this
Loving the thrill of the chase so get the fuck outta my face
N9nes a nigga with the sickness yeah and it aint no blocking this
It doesnt matter the race just get the fuck outta my face


Going withering away
Going withering away
Going withering away
Gone
I gotta say when my mother died I really did inside
And thats the other thing that did it
Turning my crazy on a hundred babies gonna plummet
Maybe I should be committed
What am I supposed to do
Do I just keep faking Fucking forsaking everything I am
Another pissed motherfucker with a fist and a plan
Oh but youre making me do this
I can scream while you stand there clueless
If youre listening Ive made up my mind
Take another step but Im fed this time
Something please save me Im losing myself
I dont think I wanna stop it but the feeling inside is nauseous
I get really exhausted off it gotta find a way to wash it lock it
Profit nada so I got to drop it aint nobody in the cockpit toss this lostness
People from the office boxes if you cross this boss live cautious
Dont make me dont make me repeat myself
For your safety because a pilly is beneath my belt
But I dont wanna do anything bad to anybody but Ill never be perfect
So Imma say to the people that got a little evil coming at you from me I think they deserve it
Going withering away
Going withering away
Going withering away
Gone
Straight literally snapping out my lady backing out cause Im becoming really mean and vicious
Watching me wither how can I give her love when I been so tainted by these bitches
We are the arsenal
Chemically imbalanced completely disposable
So butter my knuckles and taste it
Another sick delinquent is wasted
I dont forgive I dont forget
I havent got time to regret
Everybody else in the world can hate me
Nobody but me can save me
Shit Yates hates this place
If youre close enough to me to hit the switch you better never turn it on
I get the feeling Im gonna be craving a killing I gotta be real and the evilll fill up and sucker the middle man til he be gone
