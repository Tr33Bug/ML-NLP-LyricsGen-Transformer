Wither Lyrics
I don't care
They say my angel glow is subsiding
I'm sliding outside of these high beams, and I won't dare
Try to mend this tear, I love I'm fading, the good once there is just dying
So I'm withering away, and I'ma trigger when I spray, and I'm attacking everybody 'til the feeling's gone

All my life I loved with people
So passive back then, I thought I'd be above this evil
My tolerance level then was up with doves and eagles
Currently, I've hit ground zero under bugs and beetles
I'm tilted, inside my head's a lettuce but wilted
Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, I spilt it
Could it be how many times I've been ran over and jilted?
That makes me wanna totally detach from light and just kill shit
I'll know when the pain is gone
It's just a matter of time before my pulses win
And I can feel the wrong
Coming up through the cracks of my heart again
I'm holding on, I'm going
Straight into the mouths of makers, everything that keeps me calm was taken
I'm letting go, I'm burning through, reserves are low
Just pushing on these old restraints, my time is up 'cause it's too late

I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up at any time today
I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up at any time today

I am looking for some fire, yeah, putting on my gang attire
Drooling and blood I can taste, so get the fuck outta my face
I'm a killer with a quick switch, yeah, all I ever really wanted was bliss
Look at me wither to waste, so get the fuck outta my face
Find another one to get bent, yeah, and it ain't no stopping this
Loving the thrill of the chase, so get the fuck outta my face
N9ne's a nigga with the sick-ness, yeah, and it ain't no blocking this
It doesn't matter the race, just get the fuck outta my face

Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Gone

I gotta say, when my mother died, I really did inside
And that's the other thing that did it
Turning my crazy on a hundred babies gonna plummet
Maybe I should be committed

What am I supposed to do?
Do I just keep faking? Fucking forsaking everything I am?
Another pissed motherfucker with a fist and a plan
Oh, but you're making me do this
I can scream while you stand there clueless
If you're listening, I've made up my mind
Take another step, but I'm fed this time

Something, please save me, I'm losing myself

I don't think I wanna stop it, but the feeling inside is nauseous
I get really exhausted off it, gotta find a way to wash it, lock it
Profit nada so I got to drop it, ain't nobody in the cockpit toss this lostness
People from the office boxes, if you cross this boss, live cautious
Don't make me, don't make me repeat myself
For your safety because a pilly is beneath my belt
But I don't wanna do anything bad to anybody, but I'll never be perfect
So I'mma say to the people that got a little evil coming at you from me, I think they deserve it
Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Gone

Straight, literally snapping out, my lady backing out 'cause I'm becoming really mean and vicious
Watching me wither, how can I give her love when I been so tainted by these bitches

We are the arsenal
Chemically imbalanced, completely disposable
So butter my knuckles and taste it
Another sick delinquent is wasted
I don't forgive, I don't forget
I haven't got time to regret
Everybody else in the world can hate me
Nobody but me can save me

Shit, Yates hates this place
If you're close enough to me to hit the switch, you better never turn it on
I get the feeling I'm gonna be craving a killing, I gotta be real and the evil'll fill up and sucker the middle man 'til he be gone28Embed
