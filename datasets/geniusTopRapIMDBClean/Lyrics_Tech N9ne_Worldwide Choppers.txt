Sen kalk bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada diktafonuna tak
Kat kalem bir de ilham alnacak
Tam gaz choppers havada dman avna kalm
Akalm haydi bu battle kazanalm
We started in the Midwest  Midwest Midwest 
Now we bout to take it  Take it take it take it  all over the world baby  Baby baby 
This is the pinnacle  Pinnacle pinnacle  Yeah Tech N9ne  Tech N9ne 
Follow me all around the planet I run the gamut on Sickology
They can never manage we do damage with no apology
Pick em off they panic a little manic cause I gotta be
Frantic Ima jam it cause Im an oddity
Gobble the track up like Im grubbin at Mama Nakas
I can pop at you proper cause Im partners of Waka Flocka
Gimme the top of hiphop
And watch him make em rock with a showstopper
Chakras poppin off the  Worldwide Choppers 
If you anybody you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle not a identical soul is it
Loaded cold as the polar get
Wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
Abdiea bdiea never to get free of the real
Better get just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Gimme the knock and Ima chop
But he came and he went tomorrow
But Ima lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit em up and get em up
I aint done I aint did enough
Trippin when I rip it I be the ish when I spit em up
Sorta like I was liquored up and backin up in the gut
Everybody be knowin I be actin up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada I be keepin the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man the brand is unanimous
Can I cuss Fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave em in the dust aint nobody tough when Im standin up
Tech is hostile hes awful
And really be wicked when he be off in a bottle
You wit it you dig it you never lost the apostle
He sick and he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killin everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper thats tossed in a brothel
You said its pathetic my head is off in a taco
I sped and you bled and you in a coffin when I go


Im light years ahead of my peers
Want some you can come bring it right here  Worldwide Choppers 
Cant clown me dont come round me
Bow down I was crowned when they found me
Check it Im ahead of em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developin
Aint gotta tell him its evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
Youre delicate but lovin every second of this
De vil alle tjekke nr vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smkker det beatet  jeg vkker det
I ved hva der kommer ud af min mund
Hnger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle fucking chopper
What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovahs Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playin Hamlet
Syllable burnin that internal damage
Swing batter batter but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree like I was peelin pecans
But instead Im peelin rappers heads makin a sandawich
Pick up a 22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from Westside a 1987 box
Im headed up yeah headed for bucks
Fuck em all make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fuckin beat and I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne twist up the pine
And smoke a beat with Mr Busta Rhymes Well sure why not
Really dont need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up beat it up then I gotta go
But Ima dump truck just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
With an alien probe Im light years
Im light years ahead of my peers
Want some you can come bring it right here  Worldwide Choppers 
Cant clown me dont come round me
Bow down I was crowned when they found me
Twista
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit em and give em astigamatism
And then Ima spit em somethin so full of vengeance
That everybodyll wanna devour the pieces
Of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breakin them off into particles
They get in a predicament that be never reversible
Cause a nigga be too versatile makin you nervous
You could never compete with the colonel
I burn you Im an immortal and thats the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya then your respect I better have it
Cause Im an anomaly then Ima give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challengin my astronomy
Hoppin I dont stop with the fire when the flames thrown
Im one of the most popular choppers and my names known
Throwin it up in the air takin it there
We WWC if you cant keep up shoulda stayed home
My alien knowledge be makin other astronomers
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and Ima be shinin on them haters
Im finna be usin it as energy watch how radiant Ima be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin with the most intricate lyricists
Dont even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide

Want some you can come bring it right here  Worldwide Choppers 
Cant clown me dont come round me
Bow down I was crowned when they found me
See now they ask when Ima stomp on my dude
And when Ima cock it and pop it and what Ima drop on my dude
Inevitably is that Ima be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together my dude  Worldwide Choppers 
And then they ask What in the world is you provin
When you were already the best and What the hell is he doin
