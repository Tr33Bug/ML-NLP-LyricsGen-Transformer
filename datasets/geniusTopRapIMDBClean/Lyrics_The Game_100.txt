Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib it was like me Black 40 OB
We just sittin there talkin bout life
Played some beats but I forgot to tell you one thing
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40 a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified
You better off committin suicide teachers aint testin us
See I know how it feel to be platinumplus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up but its OVOBlood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors when you cant do the fifth
How soon they forget
Run up on you at your granny house give you nine like Fif
How are niggas sposed to love you niggas
Heart beatin fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off youre finicky I rush you niggas
Just walkin round the crib like Why a nigga cant live
Get this money fuck these bitches though
Thinkin bout the beef like
We can pass these mothafuckin straps like a physical
This my city nigga everybody know it
Ridin round town just me and my fourpound
Tucked in my Tom Fords hopin I aint gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest these niggas do some shady shit
Niggasll run up on your car catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit 40 Im fucked up
Yall better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Yall better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Yall better off realizin theres nothin that yall could do wit me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me one hunnid
LA niggas be the craziest yeah one hunnid
LA all I ever asked is one hunnid
LA LA niggas be the craziest one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
Thank me later thanks for nothin thanks for bluffin
Thank you so so much for wearin your true colors
To every single fuckin function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin off the budget
Now when I see em theyre the ones thats actin funny
People been reachin out to me
And Im on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didnt have money respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didnt go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
Im in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah nobodys even hearin it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica disappear again
My circle got so small that its a period sayin to myself
Yall better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Yall better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Yall better off realizin theres nothin that yall could do wit me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me one hunnid
LA niggas be the craziest yeah one hunnid
LA all I ever asked is one hunnid
LA LA niggas be the craziest one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
Miss 4 Cent that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil nigga
If he was still alive he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin your nigga though
Cant think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin while drivin down Figuero
Blowin kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like Here it go
Screamin Frog name at the clouds they dont hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas dont feel me though
That was on Suges watch Ill take Suges watch
You dissin Drizzy thats cool but dont come to my city though
Not even to HTown
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
Thats word to Pimp C J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest these niggas do some shady shit
Niggasll run up on your car catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused but why a nigga gotta choose
Dont even matter dawg cause Ima always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga

Yall better not come to my studio with that fake shit
