My mom took me to Sam Goody
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
I fuck with Game
I like 50 Cent
He reminds me SpongeBob
And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
Theyre my friends
Psyche
I went down one of them bodega shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home put it in my boombox
Thought I was bout to be on some Radio Raheem shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams in 88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wall Street for life now
GGGUnot
300 Bars and Runnin
Just loan me your ears for fifteen minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown
Pass the doja 45 in the holster
Hollow tipsll fold em them niggas they toy soldiers
Oh that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like Im the president but this aint the Takeover
Now theres the speaker bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that When Im just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard yeah standing his ground
Im saying if you gon retire then hand me the crown
Nah let Bleek do it then throw him a concert in Madison Square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar Ill let the lines speak to em
What they say Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing Ima smack em silly
What you thought Them was the only niggas rapped in Philly
See them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
Cosmic Kev called said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a Uturn I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheesesteak thats what I told the cops
So they wouldnt get the dogs start searching for the Glock
And I cant forget BIG got murdered by the cops
Even I was ready to die when I heard that he was shot
Whats beef Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing anything still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block so I dont feel threatened
When Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot
Ask 50 it get lonely on top you can hate me
Or love me but now the cops the only homies he got
When its beef we eat when we hear bologna we pop
You sell records but a GGGUnot
Acting big on the radio to me you not
You can ask Mister Cee who hot
Tony Yayo I bet 10 Gs you flop
Run up on that new 300C you got
Stop hoping I fall hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you blackout before you see the cops
I aint High Top from Colors Im from Cedar Block
But what I got in my high topsll make your breathing stop
Im a gangsta slash rapper check your CD shop
Im like Elvis in there they cant believe he dropped
Now Im moving on up to George and Weezys spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it then loosened the straps
It get hot in here let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets put the dueceduece to your hat
Then call the pigs tell them the rooster is back
Call Jadakiss tell him that duke is back
Im still by your side no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks it aint about who could rap
Its about when the Ruger clap is rufus back
I see what you thinkin you want me to die is that so
Now you left leaning back thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven you ready Lets go
Drop them off then pop Cristal with Esco
Ima say he hit me first if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a braveheart
Now thats the eulogy beefing is kinda foolish
See niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars Im still gon shine
Im ten years younger than Yayo I get out Im fine
Then I go right back nigga I pop minds
How you gon drop Olivia You only drop dimes
I knew you changed when you started sleeping in that vest dawg
I dont need 50 Cent my niggas make collect calls
1800split a faggot nigga wig
He got GUnit wings throw em off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is overcareer is over
We in QB banging CNN in the Rover
TONY thats Capone n NORE
You aint the talk of New York your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off nigga go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent to send you a copy of Beef 3
Im airing their ass out on DVD
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me
Im a GUnit toy soldier on Sesame Street
Doing voice overs bitch ass nigga
Need a rhyme dictionary to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio when I first got signed
He got stuck he called 50 tried to borrow some lines
Thats the wrong nigga when you need help with your rhyme
All he gon tell you is say GUnit one more time
Got mad cause I aint wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja why you aint go at Shyne
He freestyled from the pen thats just the fact
Said hed put you with your mom and you aint fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops he never bust no cap
Like father like son go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning not to trust those cats
Id kill em all if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
And Im far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it put it in the store the shit moving
Gave em a hundred bars they aint think I could do it
Came with two hundred nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it that boy hot like summer
Both feet in the dirt 300 Bars and Runnin
I beef with any nigga say my name motherfucka Im gunnin
You can put it on Skee if you want it
Ill air you out on Drama King Mike or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordan shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Dont hit me on the Sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50s police to use his
Cause Bloods gonna get ya
BloodBloodBloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains when I pop shots
Outside NY in front of hiphop cops
Or broad day in LA Ima tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music aint nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs then put it on his tapes
So Ima take him out his house put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad let him scream for the jakes
Cause when you fucking with Jayceon you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggas on them CDs and tapes
Ask him to scratch a record you will see that he is fake
If 50 was Puffy youd run and go get him a cheesecake
Take the DJ off your name Mr Instant Replay
Now the instant replay I mean the machine
That GUnit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only feel your shit just a lil bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil bit
On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit
Only on two songs now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest I see to your death yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebok to make him some boots get him a head band
To cover the holes in his head he a dead man
For thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam
Without a METHOD Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice never wear Air Max to the bing
Unless you one of the Bloods or a Latin King
Cause if you left with the Aryans your assll sting
And your cellmate is a 25 to lifer
Theyll stab you in Folsom then fuck you on Rikers
And life goes on
Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits you shouldve kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move Im blasting add those to the last ones
Ten shots from the MAC empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling thats enough let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking Fase think Im locin backing up
Reverse the 05 hearse on 41st and traffic what
Hiphop cops on my left but I pass em up
The Dodge got a Hemi in it Game got Remy in em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I miss the old king that New York had
Whos this fake nigga on pictures with the Jake nigga
Got his crew starving cause he ate the whole cake nigga
He aint Nas aint BIG aint Jigga
If he aint Cube or Pac then who you got
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
Ill use another six bars to tell you who you not
You aint 50 Cent he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica three months after Wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
Cmon man what happened to the thug
Now you could find in the club him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now Im into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family Game had to go
Nigga Ill smack that hoe like Im JackiO
Cause I dont wanna be cool I dont wanna be you
I dont wanna shake hands or wear your GUnit shoes
Dont want you on my hooks dont wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait  for the summer 
To be gone so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted
Pull the brim low if they dont get it
Bentley Coup on gold Daytons I was the first one with it
Four times platinum I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord giveth Lord taketh away
So I build a house on top of HipHop Ill wait for the day
Niggas hating on me they dont want Jayceon to play
And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the squad car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimal pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock nah this aint no subliminal Jay
The summer too hot and I just want the winter to stay
Cause Im a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand em off to Dre he turned them into grenades
And Just Blaze cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever then Im Kanye West
Take a look at my chest a hundred thou wet Jacob
Whole crew got chains a hundred thou cant break em
And the flow is hot like thou with Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get the more willing to snake em
So soon as the beat drop watch where I take em
Compton swap meet to get me some AllStars
When Game in the house they callin all cars
Cause they heard about what went on in DC
Heard about Hot 97 my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience
I think not cause if he did I wouldnt be involved in his nonsense
Wouldnt be in Harlem wouldnt be at this conference
Id rather be pushing rock like Samantha Ronson
50 whispered in my ear like we still bonding
We aint friends Im just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air one hand on my Johnson
HipHop police on me like Im the convict
What happened to the old school I thought it was rhyming
Doug E Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common
Now that aint common its more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds they kicked me out of
GUnit and I rebounded like Rodman
Its still Aftermath two feet in the paint
Should I be mad I aint
Im supposed to stop I cant
Because Im in the hood politicking Impala liftin
And I keep a black fourfive on the side of my Prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like Im fresh outta prison
Dollar vision blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then reup like Kim before the dcup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you aint gon do that so motherfucker move back
While I do BIG and Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead everybody remove hats
We miss yall can I get a hand clap
Now back to rap and why I gotta stay strapped
On that murder TIP kill you ASAP
They dont know which hole to patch up when the K clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck now its time for payback
It go how you from Cashville but you aint got no cash nigga
Said my name now thats your fucking ass nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck buck buck from my AK47
This nigga playing with his life I might have to put him in Heaven
Tryna play the game talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burials when Im reincarnating HarryO
And you dont want that David cause you love your life
Get my Vibe When its war he pull out butter knifes
Motherfucker Ima show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc now who the wanksta
When Suge had you you were stranded on the row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch and thats hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning GUnit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands and you aint had the ten stacks
Picture that I thought we was GUnit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did the shit
Ask CMurder the boy aint hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him the boy is mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you 50 Banks Yayo and the cops
And Olivia I mean for a man she hot
Now Im running out of breath like I just beatboxed
Got twenty bars to go lay it down like sheet rock
Dont worry about the flow the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November nigga fuck Reeboks
Im fly like a hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov the new BIG the new Pac I need three spots
280 in aint no getting me back
Im yelling Fuck the world on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens then it was Bleek
Now its whoever motherfucker yeah who want beef
Now whenever motherfucker who wanna see me
In the coffin body exhausted resting in peace
You dont want war nigga you want peace
So give em the piece capisce let em rest in peace
From West to East the flow is outdatable irreplaceable
Lyrical homicide hell is hot Im boxing with Satan
And I slipped em the ace so you cannot replace em
If Eazy ever decide to return I remain Jayceon
A king in the making and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin nigga the wait is over
Im gone
