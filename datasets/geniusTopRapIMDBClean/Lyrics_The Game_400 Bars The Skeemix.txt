400 Bars  The Skeemix  LyricsIts been a long time get reacquainted with the world famous
You know how on point my aim is
Long range snipers clash of the titans chrome pipen
In this 300 like Leonidas
Snub in the bubblegoose riding down the interstate
Where fiends put them needles in they arm and let em penetrate
Leanin sideways with my fitted straight
The 27s on point the paint job a New York minute late
Check my Audemar no clouds in my stones
Projects ringin standin by the corner store
Two Glocks on me BANG BANG if you wanna war
That was 05 now we ballin on this tour
Screamin out Thug Life pourin Belve on ya whore
Money Im involved with it wake up and ball with it
KobeGasol with it uncut raw with it
Chop bricks take trips ot
Before I had a goatee I used to bag the Oz
Yeah fishscale nigga What up Ghost 
Then stash em by the oak tree move it by the coke leaf
Drama let the llama Knick niggas like Charles Oakley
Nigga dont insult me I banana boat BRCKSs
And stuff em in the Lexus
Im sitting fat like Precious Christ up on the necklace
And I keep them clips on a dresser
Yes sir Im bout to ball Louis bag the fuckin mall
Bitches money and fast cars nigga I want it all
Yeah word to my kids nigga I want it all 
Nascar Game why the fuck would I stall
Im the franchise nigga Chris fucking Paul
Empty out the cannon hit ya bitch you the truck and all
Withdrawal 200 thousand and then FUCK it off
King of the hill gotta dime bitch cuttin raw
She bagged the last nick I unzip she suck it soft
Black Superman yeah Im above the law
I put this hollowtip a quarter inch above ya jaw
Eat out a FUCKIN straw
Blindfold your bitch toss her in the trunk
After the first 48 that bitch smellin like a skunk
Its a wrap I rap when I wrap the punk
Throw me in the gang module and tell em wrap the bunks
The breakfast club nigga no Captain Crunch
This for my dog niggas that eat cats for lunch
Im hungry like I aint trapped in months
So nigga act and stunt my Glock pack a punch
Or I can HecklerKoch and seal your pine box
Leave your head wrapped for months while I pass the blunt
To my niggas we all Rocd out whats up Jigga
Sometimes I be in BK with Fab on the freeway
Lincoln Continental and I copped it off a eBay
I pop cham like its my bday horse power
Under my hood like its an olympic relay
My flow right on time no delay
I raise a million dollars send it off to Chile
Word to my red cross I dont fuck with the Red Cross 
Im AllMadden nigga EA Im in VA
Money talks with Dre and Pharrell on 3Way
Them 28s thats my DJ they spinning shit
When I took trips OT I never rented shit
I just drop then cop and then I tinted shit
Diddy and Mike Epps Im All About The Benjamins
In it for the benefits Ill be down in Ten to 6
Tell em get me a Porterhouse and some eggsBenedict
Damn that was good but Im still hungry
And Im living it I be out in Venice shit
They say WeezyJordan nigga Im on my Pippen shit
They say DrakeLebron Im on my Moe Williams shit
If TIP is Kobe then fuck it Im Derek Fisher shit
Long as Im in the starting five Im a get it in
Cause I promised the city of Compton I would get it in
I was OutKastd Andre Benjamin
Now I slide through with my Dominican woman friend
She like puttin No Ceilings in yeah 
Giuseppe Heels expensive wines Perri seal
It aint tricking I just spend money on cheap thrills
Big Phantoms sweet wheels
Back seat like a club make them bitches eat pills
Take Patrone shots to the purse with chrome Glocks
Jay Electronica this a dome shot
So I had to steal it nigga I had the kill it
I was the turtle in the race I made the rabbit feel it
Yeah keep runnin nigga 
Housing by the subway feel it through the projects
Come through the Murcialago a foreign object
Number one prospect the day that I was drafted
Aftermathmatic unleashed a fuckin bastard
Dont respect none of you niggas get in the casket
Talking ratchets never touched a fuckin automatic
Drama this is tragic put it in the plastic
88 bars and runnin throw it with my other classics
Drama you shouldve warned these niggas Im bout to kill em 
Yeah trash bag it this is crack
And I know you been fiendin for this come get your packs
I do it for the music nigga fuck the Plaques
Aint on no beef shit but its still FUCK the rats
And when Im in New York I set a bunch of traps
Put the cheese where they can see it and if you stunt you clapped
Catch em in the club thats when I stomp em flat
Nigga get up after that go get a fucking bat
I tell you bout these fucking rats 
They either snitch or bend over to catch
No matter how you look at it I hate fucking rats
Get my bottle of Ciroc and I twist the cap
Sit back watch the NBA playoffs and roll a bat
Yeah real fat yeah all I do is stack bread
In the hood on the wall like a fucking Phathead
Two nines on your back Warren Sapp yeah
This my block and you niggas cant trap here
Unless you wanna get clapped here head wrapped yeah
Im killing niggas I should have a hundred tat tears
Celebrate your death toast bottles and clap beers
Its gon be a cold summer come through like burr
The red Phantom bullshittin the 25 Steve Kerr
The beat insane Just Blaze in this mothafucka
The cars outside the K is in this mothafucka
I should let off a couple strays in this mothafucka
Fuck that Im tryna get laid in this mothafucka
Yo tell your friends to get with my friends Yeah 
Meet me in the parking lot license plate Aftermath
Screamin out Fuck 50 wouldnt snitch for half his cash
If he wasnt such a bitch nobody wouldve had to blast
They stood us down in Jacksonville dont make me have to wrap ya Jag
Cause I rather be in Saint Tropez unpackin bags
With bitches that speak French how you say catch a cab
I dont trip Euros I dont trip Pounds
I bowlin ball bitches till I knock em all down
Like the 93 Pac I Get Around 
Duffles by the staircase crack by the backdoor
Navigate my way through the South I used to trap ho
All the way through Queensbidge moving packs yo
Mightve lost a couple friends but I got my gat though
Blast fo my Rap foes could never stop my cash flow
Had a Nike box of hundreds when I was in that RAV4
But now I pull up in that truck with the crash board
With the mag low give you everythin you ask for
Sometimes I can be a fucking asshole
In the bank with my mask on look at this nigga AR
Dont take your fucking mask off bitch empty out the cash drawer
We on a suicide mission but we dont give fuck
Cause if we make it out bigger house bigger truck
Im in a strip club with a Glock nigga what
Gimme your bitch she got a cuter face and bigger butt
I aint gon do shit but pour champagne on her
Hit it from the back and watch half of the Laker game on her
Dont put that back on too many cum stains on it 
Run a train on her call Cartoon
Have em tattoo my name on her Star Trak too
You know what Fuck it Aftermath too
Put a little smoke around it then take it home and pound it
Helicopter outside nigga Im surrounded
Had a spot in the Jungles till the fuckin Feds found it
Momma your son got a public announcement
I got 5 million in the walls and the couches
Dont even think about it We got cameras dogs and guns 
Ask PePe he was there he can vouch it
Throw it in the trashcan on some Oscar The Grouch shit
A bunch of green popped out time to reroute shit
Settle down in Mississippi gotta down South click
And my niggas like we aint know all about this
And any nigga ever snitch got his fuckin mouth fixed
You get 25 he get his fuckin throat slit
Cut em like Filet Mignon and throw em off a boat bitch
Feed em to the sharks then dock the yacht
Oil in the water damn the ocean so thick
Time to finish off his niggas on some trench coat shit
Its a drug war real life Grand Theft
Catch you in the streets fuck you up and hit ya man next
Come through on some retarded shit just sprayin techs
Where my dogs at tell em Im crazier then DMX
Lazier then Chinese eyes when Im puffin that
Blueberry I aint talking where the muffins at
Roll up the sour diesel if you want nigga 
I split open the dutch then Im stuffin that
You should get a flight to California come fuck with that
Thats all you go ahead hop in the truck with that
Take it down in Cashville and hit Young Buck with that
Dont bring nothin back Border Patrol cuffin that
I aint trying see the pen and have to get my knuckles wrapped
I wake up real early keep lunchin fags
This shit easy you Rap niggas my punchin bags
I got some combinations nigga Pacquiao shit 
Talkin bout you poppin tags talkin bout u poppin Cris
Where u get it poppin at Nigga u aint poppin shit
But a X pill as I turn the Lex wheels
I got a mean Phantom very upset grill
Tellem why you mad son that nigga pulled a fast one
You know who you are when I see you thats ya ass son
But Im in the club throwin shots like my last gun
Its 2oclock YURR gotta make a cash run
Yo go get the truck from around the corner tell Wack Ill meet em outside 
Into the 711 bout to blast one
This nigga AR will not keep his fuckin mask on
Deal with it when we get to the crib
You niggas is wildin Wait till we get to the crib
And split this fuckin money up
Hit the block and dummy up
Shave the onion slice it down the middle thats a tummy tuck
Thats how we do it in Compton FUCK the Police
Defend my hood like an NHL goalie
Sometimes its cold on these mothafuckin streets nigga 
Iced out Rollie
And I still remember everythin that Dre told me
Red Polo fleece sippin on that OE
Never been to jail cause I never had a cold D
Do it just like the OGs
Cut the Impala in half insert the gold Ds
Then bounce this mothafucka till it got a slow leak
Flatbed pick it up and you know me
Im goin with the car all night no sleep
Gotta get this mothafucker back on the
Strip 
Next day we in the red Phantom 4 deep
Kids runnin up to the car block off the whole street
Its the ice cream man like the Ol P
Cali like the Lions oline its where the holes hoes  be
BC runnin shit like a nose bleed
Dont get it confused or screwed like Codine
More swag then the niggas from the showme
Thats ya bitch Im bout to Mac her like Goldie
Shit together we can rule the world baby 
Blacked out Cartier Four Seasons caviar
Spray a lil Diddy on it thatll get their panties off
Nigga see me in the lobby lookin like damn he soft
Catch me outside where I can let this cannon off
Soo to the Woo bet I let this cannon off
And put everything in the clip right where u standin dog
Ride off in a Mazi like can I ball
For the bucks Im tryna get it like Brandon dog
Young Money clearly NBA rookie of the year 
Im still standin tall wish the Twin Towers was
Take innocent lives thats the type of shit a coward does
Im just reminiscin smokin on the sour blood
Take a couple more hits and pass the shit around the bus
U cant tell me shit I done seen a thousand drugs
Hundred rounds in ten drums thats a thousand slugs
One day I flipped the kitchen table found a bug
Kept lookin found another one right around the subs
Ayyo Feds can u hear me God damn 
I was takin a shit then I seen one by the tub
Feedin my fish theres a wire right by the rug
Dumb mothafuckers this is not where they buy the drugs
Thats Salami in the kitchen that we fryin up
The world full of bitches all the niggas dyin up
They strechin niggas out for crack all the fiends tryin dust
We got some mean smokers for the sack they tie u up
Quarter sack and get the pound brick burn the house down
The connect aint gon think that shit is funny 
The fuck these niggas laughin at Run up u got some cash in that
Knock on ya mommas door ya head sittin in a bassinette
While Im on a G4 smokin up half the jet
All season in New York smokin up half the Jets
246 bars aint broke half a sweat
Just got half a mil gave the hood half the check
And I done shot it out with probly over half the jects
Sometimes just for the love the other half respect
Thats that HOOD shit Im livin GOOD bitch 
Out of my mind like breakin off half an X
Movin through Hollywood faster than a bag a Meth
Yup niggas better watch they step
Less they in a fraternity but that aint concernin me
Lets get back on this ape shit back to the basics
Cold words flip birds in the kitchen with cake mix
Yeah Betty Crocker that then hit the block with that
Cut off khakis house shoes and a stockin cap
Hit the Swapmeet Get me some white Ts redtip socks 
My flow a 38 dont make me have to cock it back
Shoot it like Olajuwon and bring the old Rockets back
Two holes in ya face where ya sockets at
Bring the whole hood out and show em how to drop a rat
They got them brand new Porsches out Im coppin that
V12 under the hood aint no stock in that
Panoramic sunroof me and this chick watchin glass
My hood is like cameras in the bumper watch ya ass
Get ya ass smoked around these parts youngin 
What the fuck u thought Ride up bangin Too Short
Smoke u like a Newport nigga this aint New York
I be in the jungle with lions or in the zoo lost
Or with my wolves thats dyin to get they tools off
City Of Angels be careful who you cross
Niggasll run in MrChows and take them fuckin jewels off
Rappin all that goon shit we all know that u soft
A babys ass in the Martha Stewart face cloth

So nigga you stay on your Rap shit while I stay on my trap shit
