This that sick rap kick back come to where I pitch at
Where bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack
Presidential Rollie nigga where your wrist at
I can kill you in four bars thats a Kit Kat
Did the Lambo my way with a sick wrap
Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back
No rats in my pack aint no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs stacking Pringles from the crack
Nigga I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt
Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock hit the block like whats up with it
Jay was in the Z my young gunnas in the truck with it
Sigel wouldve loved it Philly wouldve fucked with it
California state property you niggas stuck with it
Brrrring sold Peedi Crakk
Game was on the block in his beanie with a Mac

A Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada
Let me tell you who suck like banana Now or Laters
Blac Chyna head the bomb alQaeda

Bentley truck Chuck with the Henny cupped up

Told that bitch to roll the Philly for the game and she talking about practice
The Maybach is AI
Artificial intelligence motherfucker thats Junior Seau
All my doors suicide Im in Vegas shoot the five
Tell the dealer pay me dont be shy he aint from Do or Die
Now do you wanna ride back seat of my Caddy
Used to flip them pies aint no relation to Patti
And I move Ps aint no relation to Swaggy
Before that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies
Thats caine no daddy cause I aint really have one
And you cant call yourself dope if you aint never bag none

Game raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum
Used to ether the niggas in all of my 16s
Now I scare em once a year like Im fucking Halloween
This aint a dream nigga hurricane a nightmare
Stab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair
Your daddy was a bitch I had to do it
I aint need no ski mask to do it
Murder is Rihanna and Im attracted to it
Name a state Ill send a package through it
If the fed hack into it they get bossed on like Im Massachusetts Huh
Sitting in this Maybach with music
Your head is like Mustard beat and Ill put the ratchet to it
PARTY sent my jackas to it
Drama bring the Mac into it
And this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it
Gold on my neck I make your bitch put her back into it
Usain Bolt if you bring a real track into it
Another classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it
Dre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it
Traffic moving backwards through it
Ever since I had the Buick
Known for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it
And I had the yay yea I brought crack to music
Every situation in rap Ive been a savage through it
And all these hoes getting mad cause Im smashing through em
They can get a ring one day if the Cavs can do it
Be LeBron bitch Im Jayceon bitch
Who else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit
Another foreign car driven by a convict
Aventador matte black Akon lips
Nas ether niggas Game napalm shit
Niggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch
No nigga can see me on or off TV
Gum bottom Yeezys Im the 6 5 Eazy
Lightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy
Ima start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezys
Ima start beefing with Cole Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny
Or you could pick your favorite rapper and he gon be pouring out Henny
I got a bitch from MinneApolis pack a semi
Bang the ratchet at Dennys and fly herself back to Philly
She got a couple mill and she dont even know Meek
And ever since that nigga snitched on me we just dont speak
See that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak
Bloodll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek
Nicki wont get no sleep Im coming through at 4 am
Four deep to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets
It could happen lowkey
You better have Ross call me or you gon be eye level with a roach feet
This aint a diss nigga

With guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship
Fuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips
My nigga Drizzy packed you out and you aint do shit
This the Golden State and my shooters aint on no hoop shit
Nigga you know that Ill snap you like a toothpick
And snitching on niggas aint never been no cool shit
And Ive been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick

We know where you live nigga you better move quick
And start thinking twice about who you hop in the coupe with
