All eyes on ya
Ask you how your week been
Workin always let me
Work you out for the weekend
Baby Im a beast uhhuh
Can you tame me
Im gon let it out
Lay you down
Lets get to it
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London Paris see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage seorita
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza
Breakfast on the beach that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin like a fruit platter Ima bite into your peach
And um I think about to massage your feet
And um you got a body you remind of my Jeep
And um I must look amazing with you
Cause every time you on my arm I got
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one Im missin
All eyes on me
I dont want your love
We aint gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you
Member when you used to curved me leave my text message unread
And every time I asked to see you you say you goin to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin
Now you in my living room twerkin thats crazy
You wear that body suit I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller shed rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezys
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now thats my vagina she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one Im missin
All eyes on me
I dont want your love
We aint gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you
Lookin at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan lick on party favorite
On my wave tryna surf it up
Know we gettin gnarly smokin Marley burnin up
Certified with the doubleM pullin up
Tooly got a room well play Room Up In Here been here
Girl you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what Im missin
All the lights low but we lit up
I dont let you down if I get up
Like you got a man but youre fed up
But you know when we get together
You want me to say your name huh
Karrueche
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one Im missin
All eyes on me
I dont want your love
We aint gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
