All That  Lady  Lyrics
You know I love you like cooked food Im a good dude
Lets hit the Roscoes on Pico Im in a hood mood
Im sittin here thinkin bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is play your position for Birkin bags
We poppin tags her shoe game sick
We drinkin Ace out of red bottles true gang shit
Fuck with me and youre famous
Kanyed my bitch now shes away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plates yeah my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew wed grew into whatever we into
Thats too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug yeah she cool like that
In them Trues why you move like that
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that all that all that all that all that
My lady got me going
Im where she already knows
She know she can get
All that all that all that
Uh you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies lets be creative
She say Leave them tricks alone but Im a skater
I love her like her daddy told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches she the only one good
I get her flowers for nothing she smiling and blushing
If I dont answer my phone then we probably fucking and yeah
She love my tattoos
Aint got no room for her name but Ima make room
She let her hair down we have a staredown
She said Im glad you ate itwhere my cap and gown
Told her I can be your chauffeur dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms thats my MO haha
Redbone pretty

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so

All that all that all that all that all that
My lady got me going
Im where she already knows
She know she can get
All that all that all that
Sean Don whoa
Look my girls sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
The D give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like Im looking down from Heaven
Screaming Oh Hell no
When you hop on top girl thats what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it aint feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed thats just real life  shit 
Cause its hard when you aint on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wade but we aint on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me bout her ex man her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo you know toy stories
Dont fuck her on her period aint into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant she order for me
Cause she know me
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that all that all that all that all that
My lady got me going
Im where she already knows
She know she can get
All that all that all that
It make sense right yeah
Girl look Im feeling your style
Im loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
Youre killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills girl
Youre all that
