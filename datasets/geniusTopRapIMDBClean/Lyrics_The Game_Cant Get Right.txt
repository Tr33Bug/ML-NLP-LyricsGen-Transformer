I bumped Ether bumped Takeover
Seein Jay and Nas on stage was hiphops makeover
And that very day you knew niggas was born
Tyler The Creators Drake J Coles and Big Seans
Time for the world to pay homage
Bow to the rap Gods or them Ks vomit
Fuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit
If you aint fuck then you aint get your dick wet
I see your little chain
I see your little dreads tryin to be a Lil Wayne shit
I used to wanna be a little Hov
Started with a little rock got me a little stove
Made a little money bought me a little Rov
Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
Sold ten mill everybody know my name now
Thinkin back its a motherfuckin shame how
Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
Sometimes I gotta step in the church cause I aint tryin to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
Its time to confess my sins cause I aint tryin to go to hell
I smoke weed pop pills but Im thinkin its time for me to chill
Cause I aint tryin to go to hell
Im tryin to get some head tonight have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I aint tryin to go to hell
Father forgive me cause I aint perfect
No no no no
Why is everything wrong
Oh I cant get it right I always try to get it right
Dre promised me records I never got em
Thats why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
For all my albums missed records
Felt he shitted on me for Kendrick recorded diss records
And Kendrick my nigga put him on his first mixtape
I pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre
And Im tellin yall this true story cause Im real
Dre first time hearing bout it wonder how he feel
Cause I feel like shit severin the relationship
The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
Snoop Pac Em 50 me K Dot watch us do a 360
Plus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries
I aint trippin niggas been disloyal for centuries
Finally got the crown this motherfucker meant for me
Funny how you do your top 5s and dont mention me
Fuck em all
Father forgive me cause I aint perfect
No no no no
Why is everything wrong
Oh I cant get it right I always try to get it right
See I been spendin these late nights
On girls I never see again
Constantly intoxicated
Only God could save me yeah
With em by the sunrise
One day everyone dies
Thats the way the story goes
But now I cant feel my heart
But I just keep ridin ridin
Feel so numb numb oh yeah
Father forgive me cause I aint perfect
No no no no
Why is everything wrong
Oh I cant get it right I always try to get it right
