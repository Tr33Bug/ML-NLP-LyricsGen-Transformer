Can I trust you gonna ride for me like I ride for you
Future Hendrix yeah
Bongo by the way
Money we burn it on bitches like candles
Can I trust you gonna ride for me like I ride for you
I speak your name and its royalty
You see the stress and my loyalty
You gotta be there for me through the casualties
You see my trials and my tribulations
You can tell them demons tryna capture me
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
I know these niggas gon ride yeah squeeze triggers
You gotta put in some time for this
Almost lost my mind for this
Fuck all that crying lil bitch
Niggas round my way they dying for this

You already know me know how I get down
Know Im with the shit when I pull up
Any nigga ever disrespected you from the beginning
I put the chrome to his neck like a pull up
You know a nigga bang Cedar block
You was bool with it wasnt you
Talkin bout when a nigga gonna leave the block alone
But you never say this shit when Im fucking you
We was the Huxtables everything was perfect
Everything was working
We had some beautiful kids together
Had a nigga feeling like everything was worth it
Closet full of Birkins
How you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses
Then have an attitude
Like you in the studio helping a nigga write verses
Had a nigga focused on the future now a nigga feeling like Future
We both dealing with a new nigga round our kids
And we aint kill em yet nigga I salute you
And I still bang like I used to red Impala gold things like I used to
Pick up my kids they dont see none of that
But when Im back in the hood Im yelling soo woo
And it was all good just a week ago
Shit we was Nicki and Meek a week ago
Gave you everything the watch the house the cards
Tatted your passport and now you wanna see me low
Wanna take my pussy give it to the next nigga free
One thing about the next nigga
He just the next nigga he can never be me
Im coming to get my kids and they momma like


Fuck all these bitches Im yours
Fuck all these bitches Im yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas

Compton aint the same
Where all these bitch niggas come from
Cant even take a fade or ride through the hood
Without niggas hands out like they want some
But where you at when I need you
See most of these niggas see through
You throw up a P I throw up a P too
You pulling out heat I draw the heat too
Compton made me like this nigga
Fuck all these bitches get money and die
Hundred niggas in my section hundred Rollies in the sky
Theres a hundred little niggas that will bang on a nigga
Put the flame on a nigga take chains from a nigga
That will go BG Turk and Wayne on a nigga
When the club get cloudy let it rain on a nigga
We are with the shit let us redefine lit
Thats in the club smoking on extendos extendo with the clip
Standing on the couch like wah
Backwood hanging out my mouth like wah
Who the fuck want a problem
Once youre shot leave a nigga dead on an island
Creep out the back door with my side bitch aye
Fuck all these bitches Im yours
Fuck all these bitches Im yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas

Dont you know theres no better time than when Im with you
But I cant control these temptations when a nigga not with you
You wanna be done with me but your heart wont let it
Standing at the front door but you just cant exit
