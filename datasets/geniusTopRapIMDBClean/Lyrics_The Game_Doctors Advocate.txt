Day after day feel like I 
G Yo Bus I think I got itthe answer to all my problems
B Fuck you talkin about nigga Whawhats that
G Belvedere and Banana Snapple
B Look get your fuckin ass up nigga
You over here trippin on yourself nigga
Get in the fuckin car man we gotta bounce man
G Im a manand most of these niggas they dont know how to be a man I got a son
B What the fuck you talkin about nigga
Come on nigga lets take yo ass to the crib man you tired nigga
And put the drink down nigga We gotta go nigga
G One more shot
I didnt mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank like lalala
Now Im sittin in this god damned cage
Rreminiscin about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings lalala
Dre I aint mean to turn my back on you
But Im a man and sometimes a man do what he gotta do
Remember Im from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in em so I started wearin Khaki suits
I was 12 smokin chronic in 92
I had a choice be like Mike or be like you
I made a choice now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was I was bangin Gin  Juice
Never knew back then Id be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangsta cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him for the Black Bitch track
And niggas stopped bumpin Dre after Dee Barnes got slapped
When Doc say its a wrap its a wrap
Its still Aftermath and aint nothing after that
I didnt mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank like lalala
Now Im sittin in this god damned cage
Rreminiscin about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings lalala
I never said Thank You and I took for granted
You let me in your house and made me a part of your family
Now Im eatin with you Eve and Busta Rhymes
I wasnt starstruck I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc Id take a bullet for you
Im not askin you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was okay to say Fuck The Police
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk to do Start From Scratch
I told you you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin here lookin at my platinum plaques
Thinkin what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a wrap its a wrap
Its still Aftermath and aint nothin after that
I didnt mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank like lalala
Now Im sittin in this god damned cage
Rreminiscin about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings lalala
See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in em made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let em know I dont agree with what he do
But he a hardhead Dre thats why Im talkin to you
See when I first met my nigga son was layin in the cut
Type reserved homie was quite and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me he flippin from the gut
I dug his spirit and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
As time went on now he was workin with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build so I gave additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga you should face it
So big I dont even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldnt listen
But when Doc say its a wrap its a wrap
Its still Aftermath and aint nothing after that
I didnt mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank like lalala
Now Im sittin in this god damned cage
Rreminiscin about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings lalala
B Aiyo Game Aiyo Game Wake up nigga
G Im up man Im up
B We at your crib nigga get the fuck out the car nigga get up man
G This aint my house my house is is green
B The fuck you talk look come on nigga lets go man
