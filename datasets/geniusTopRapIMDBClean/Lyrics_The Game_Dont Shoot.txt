Our Lord grant us good in this world
And good in the life to come keep us safe from the torment of the fire
As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson rest in peace Mike Brown
And all the young soldiers out there
God help us
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot we all got shot
Throwing up our hands dont let them shoot us
Cause we all we got we all we got
God aint put us on the Earth to get murdered its murder
God aint put us on the Earth to get murdered its murder
Dont point your weapons at me
Seen the pictures feel the pain scandalous how they murder son
Tired of them killing us Im on my way to Ferguson
Talked to TIP I talked to Diddy them my brothers walking with me
Mothers crying Stop the riots we aint got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there felt I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin teens they killin dreams  Its murder 
Yo come on we gotta stick together we all we got
Police taking shots and I aint talkin bout Ciroc
Im talking bout Emmett Till Im talking bout Ezell Ford
Im talking bout Sean Bell they never go to jail for
Trayvon over Skittles Mike Brown Cigarillos
History keeps repeating itself like a Biggie instrumental
Americas a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window
I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky still was left in the road
Ribbon in the sky Michael Brown another soul
Stole by the system black men we pay the toll
The price is your life Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming Im a Boss


Time to take a stand and save our future  Maybach Music 
Like we all got shot we all got shot
Throwing up our hands dont let them shoot us
Cause we all we got we all we got
God aint put us on the Earth to get murdered its murder
God aint put us on the Earth to get murdered its murder
Dont point your weapons at me
Tired of the okiedokie lying you Pinocchio
Driving while black tell me where am I supposed to go
Gun shots hit the car now I got the holy ghost
If excessive force was a drug then they overdosed
Got us tryna protest its a slow process
Heard its a lotta rotten eggs in the crows nest
People praying on they feet police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street
Yeah I seen a lot of ice water tossed and I know its for a cause
My only question is what we doing for the loss
Of Mike Brown
Cause right now I challenge you to use your talents to
Speak up and dont you ever let em silence you
Cause action speaks louder than words thats what I heard
Shot down with his hands up thats what occurred
Man that sound absurd
Matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice
Ayy yo Game I had a crib out there
I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
People stressing protesting unity is a blessing
So its time we come together
Use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown cause I stand for what he stand for
News say were looting
Paint pictures like we some animals
On my NWA CMG
Hollerin Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police
Heard another brother slain up in St Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain but what you famous doing
Im sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you youre ice challenged
Okay and I support the ALS just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt
So you just flexing then
Cause everybody care for a minute then stop
People only there for a minute then stop
And whats the point of giving if you aint giving your all
We never getting ahead might as well give up your heart
Where does it end
I got my hands up what else am I supposed to do
Rest in peace to Mike Brown
Where does it end
And all the other fallen soldiers
Tell me wheres the love for everything were going through
That will not be on the news or televised ah
Mercy mercy mercy mercy me
Hope that God can save us
Mercy mercy mercy mercy me
As we lead in peace
Martin Luther King had a dream
But they aint respecting Jesse up out here
And they dont really respect Obama out here
Lights out go dark  its like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game but they aint playing fair
Its going down Armageddon right here
Right now not on TV but right here
Put your flags in the air if you dont really care  Wave it 
We need justice yeah we need justice here
I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts a confused country
Im a resident of a nation that dont want me
Whats done is done the town erupts in fury
And Im already hearing bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried
The revolution has been televised
If I sit here and do dont do nothing homie thats genocide
Fuck that we have arrived
And who cares who aint on our side cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own
My brodie Game just banged my line like We gotta do something
All that marching and that peace aint gonna fucking do nothing
Fuck it my moms sorry Im ready to rage
The police done let the animals out of the cage
Oh lord its
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot we all got shot
Throwing up our hands dont let them shoot us
Cause we all we got we all we got
God aint put us on the Earth to get murdered its murder
God aint put us on the Earth to get murdered its murder
Dont point your weapons at me
Stand up
