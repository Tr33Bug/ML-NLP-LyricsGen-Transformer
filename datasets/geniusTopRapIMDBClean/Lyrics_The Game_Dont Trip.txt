And I could have been a Crip but I aint like blue that much
All Crip school I aint really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my Bulls jacket giving you the facts on Elm
King Frog and Big Face they had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the TFlats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm thats how I got my stripes
