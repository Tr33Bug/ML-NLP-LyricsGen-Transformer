And I brought
And I brought
And I broughtdreams
dreams
dreams
And I brought you all my dreams cause I love you
Ilove you
Ilove you
III love you
I woke up out that coma 2001
Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents Nigga Witta Attitude Volume One
Rap critics politickin wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin with Dr Dre was a  Dream 
I had visions of makin a classic then my world turned black
Like I was starin out of Stevie Wonders glasses
Its kinda hard to imagine like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin and rappin
But we the future Whitney Houston told me that
Its gon take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back
Blushin in this 40 ounce lettin the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a  Dream 
Aaliyah had a  Dream  Left Eye had a  Dream 
So I reached out to Kanye and  I brought you all my dreams cause I love you 
Ilove you
Ilove you
III love you 


I had dreams of fuckin a RB bitch like Ma
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine she loved gangsters loved nasty things
So Im in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled lifes obstacles found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
Til I was crushed by Dave Mays almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin yesterday dozin off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over heard Jam Master say
Its a hard knock life then you pass away
They say sleep is the cousin of death so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath
Blushin in this 40 ounce lettin the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a  Dream 
Aaliyah had a  Dream  Left Eye had a  Dream 
So I reached out to Kanye and  I brought you all my dreams cause I love you 
Ilove you
Ilove you
III love you 
The dream of Huey Newton thats what Im livin through
The dream of Eric Wright thats what Im givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagans shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid then I start blazin Clue
It was all a dream like Big said itd be
Dont sleep on me homey I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon defyin the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics start revisin my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds wonderin where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this Im livin for my son
But I cant figure out why Im at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun
Blushin in this 40 ounce lettin the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a  Dream 
Aaliyah had a  Dream  Left Eye had a  Dream 
So I reached out to Kanye and  I brought you all my dreams cause I love you 
Ilove you
Ilove you
III love you 
This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton
Sunday September 14th 2003 rest in peace
I brought you all my dreams cause I love you 
Ilove you
Ilove you
III love you 
And I brought
And I brought
And I broughtdreams
dreams
dreams 
And I brought you all my dreams cause I love you
