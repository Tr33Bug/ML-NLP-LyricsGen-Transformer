Here we go again
Ten years later
You know what man Uhm
I wanna know 
Fuck it
Ayo C
Give me that Jameson and that pickle juice
Thank you
I got some shit on my mind
I wanna know 
My little nigga Frogg dead dog
They shot my little nigga in his head dog
You heard what the fuck I just said dog
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red dog
If you seen your best friend stiff you would cry too
Sometimes I dont even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin brother
I wanna know 
Who killed G man too The shit I seen men do
If I told you Id have me floating in some cement shoes
See Compton aint shit really
And Ive been at the bottom of the pits feel me
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac Im like birdie at the troops
I cant lie every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I dont know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil nigga them my cross streets
And who gon take it from me
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie
I wanna know names
Clickclack explain
I can kill you but aint nothing gon change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
Im gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day


I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest its kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one the homies never came to see me
Suspect two Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldnt see me
Theres usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night Im like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
Im cool with taking mine but I took other niggas gunshots
Chest wide open Im tryna fight but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me cause I shot them
But who set me up I aint tripping but
I wanna know 
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie
I wanna know names
Clickclack explain
I can kill you but aint nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
Im gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day
Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit he aint always have a nigga back
When I met him he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand couldnt even finish his fuckin sentence
I aint owe him shit but real recognize real
Now we like two rednosed Pits
Cross him you gotta cross me
And dont forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut that niggas nuts dont give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death and he mean it from the guts
Blood whats up Which one of you dumb mothafuckas wanna try us
I wanna know
