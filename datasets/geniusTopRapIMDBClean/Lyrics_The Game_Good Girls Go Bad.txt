Since Big aint here Im about to do it for Tyanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanyes mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down getting beat on by they man
Respect women I dont care if they a 2 or a 10
We dont beat on Kat Stacks we just bring it to an end
And we dont wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
Theres missing women out there lets just focus on them
This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on fathers day
I know she gone but she aint far away
I just had a daughter pass me that cigar Ye
Im bout to tell a story everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened  Broadway 
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good nigga she aint gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga I aint get a deal with ya
You aint saying nothing you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair
Dont make the good girls go bad no
Dont make the good girls go bad no  I wont 
If you dont you gon really love us   I said I wont 
Please dont use us dooont
Good evening Im in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm I dont believe em
Whos still getting tested
Wheres all the women that can still remember who they slept with
Wheres all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list
But when you do go out you still working what you was blessed with
Do it girl Ill be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough you something I want a piece of you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly her hearts a little chilly
She a little too carefree
In 10 years whos paying for all that therapy
Umm nigga not me yeah
Im probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When Im done with bad bitches know Im coming straight to you good girl
Dont make the good girls go bad no
Dont make the good girls go bad no
If you dont you gon really love us
Please dont use us noo
Drizzy Im sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like uhh them is basketball wives
Only cute one Gloria thats my nigga Matt Barnes chick
Cant swim in that poon fool thats a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass get on
Disrespect my chick that type of shitll get you spit on
I dont hit on girls I just hit on girls
Like hey lil mama come in Game and Drizzys world
Get busy girl drink that ros til youre dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost like where is he girl
He on the top of the charts next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye so let the Don spray
Thats your girl Nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do Im pulling up in that Porsche like lets ride
Dont make the good girls go bad no
Dont make the good girls go bad no
If you dont make the good girls go bad no
Dont make the good girls go bad no
If you dont you gon really love us
Please dont use us nooo
Word on the news stand Alicia got herself a man
And thats my nigga Swizzy know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds Imma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate dont ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went
So I can get em fitted let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas
Yeah Im married to the game
And she married to my chain watching Boyz n The Hood
Lets take a drive down memory lane
