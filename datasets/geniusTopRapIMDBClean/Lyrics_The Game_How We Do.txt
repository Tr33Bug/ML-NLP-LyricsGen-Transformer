When beef is on Ill pop that trunk
Come get some pistol grip pump
If a nigga step on my white Air Ones

Compton uhh Dre found me in the slums
Sellin that skunk one hand on my gun
I was sellin rocks when Master P was sayin Uhhhh
Buck pass the blunt
These GUnit girls just wanna have fun
Coke and rum got weed on the ton

Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Escalade
Low pro so low look like Im ridin on blades
In one year mayne a nigga so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin both ways  ahh 
Touch me tease me kiss me please me
I give it to you just how you like it girl
Youre now rockin with the best
Tre pound on my hip Teflon on my chest
They say Im no good cause Im so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
Cause shit might pop off and if shit pop off
Somebody gon get laid the fuck out
They call me new money say I have no class
Im from the bottom I came up too fast
The hell if I care Im just here to get my cash
Bougieass bitches you can kiss my ass
This is how wedo
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club

Got a sick vendetta to get this cheddar
Meet my Beretta the drama setter
