I Dont Like  Remix  Lyrics
Stepped off of that G6
Hit the club on that G shit
You see the belt thats a G bitch
And Im bout to kill Chief Keef shit
Just killed my nigga Meek shit
Then I killed my nigga French shit
Got a French bitch no friendship
And she givin my dick a French kiss  Yeah 
A fuck nigga thats that shit I dont like
Arm hangin out the window
Of that black Ghost with them chrome pipes
Tell them niggas its gon be a long night
Bitches wanna chill we gon need some more ice  Ayy 
Shout out to John Wall man that nigga nice  Ayy 
Club leanin nigga we gon need some more Sprite
Real nigga in these RayBans
Fuck the judge we dont take stands
Tape Feds we dont shake hands
Put a gap in your mouth Strahan  Ayy 
Hundred racks in these cargos
Push the button these cars go  Ayy 
Six cradle that Lago
Six spades black card ho
Got homies out in Chicago
With that full clip on that bullshit
Dang nigga thats Rozay
Movin packs on em in MJs  Ayy 
I got a thick bitch with a thin waist
Got a condo where somethin slim stay  Ayy 
Got a Rolex Presidente
Got black diamonds Kunta Kinte
Hot boy like Turk and them
Hot wheels we swervin them
Next year we gettin Deron Williams
Gon do LeBron like Dirk and them  Yeah 
A fuck nigga thats that shit I dont like
They throwin bottles Im throwin models
Just cause I give a bitch long pipe
Doin shows on the soccer field thats dome right

But hol up I aint give a nigga no green light
This head up my bread up

Huh matter fact take care bruh you a pussy nigga
