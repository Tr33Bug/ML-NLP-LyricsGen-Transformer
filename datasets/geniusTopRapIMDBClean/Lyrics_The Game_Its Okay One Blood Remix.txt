When you see me two twelvin you homie  thats right 
You fuck niggas keep triple ninin  Eastside

Fore it get techmangy out here smell me  Ballin 
One blood one blood one blood one blood one blood 
Peace Blood peace Almighty  Peace Blood 
We all thugs and we run the streets nightly  Eastside 
And get my lawyer why Cause I aint coppin out  Nope 
And I fuck with Bboys that bring them choppers out
One shot of thatll have the boys bring the coppers out
And we ballin foreign toys what we hoppin out  Flossing 
My fair Eastside where we ride
And we all fly high in the Lear G5s  Ballin 
So twist your fingers up and bang motherfucker bang  NineTrey 
Get your money up this caine is what we fuckin slang  Gotta hustle 
And NineTrey is what I fuckin claim  Ugh 
Its Dipset Capo the don of the Byrdgang  Eastside 
They call me DOdub wasnt really trippin cuz
Twentyone twenty Crips and all of us is Crippin cuz
We from a different street all got that different heat
But when we move the Macs
When Game come we on the same beat
So if you fuck with Blood then you fuck with us
And we aint bustin duds cause we bustin slugs
Be sure to stay in touch and clean your mess up
And if you from the West Coast my nigga WWWWWest up
Game got at me about the remix its a honor my nigga
I made rap one blood Nasir signin with Jigga
I got rappers gettin mad at me
I got these new jack rappers tryin to clap at me
I got these corny wannabe diss song kings on the radio
Talk about how they gon spray and take me away
But Im the true living legend Im not to be questioned
Have your whole hood holla shit about my progression
YEAH
You knowin my attitude shitty  Okay  only a buck fifty
So I keep the Smittys with meshit how many getting it
Hey what you scared  Im prepared in the mall and all
With twotwos you can call me Quick Draw McGraw  Haha 
You try me Ima cut that fool better call the law
I start sprayin make fuck niggas fall and crawl  Bow Bow 
I press play like Puff no pause at all
Choppin holes in all the walls thats all they saw hey
Hiphop aint dead it just took a couple shots
I bring it back to life give it a couple shocks
The king comin no Im not JayZ
Too many niggas hate me but they scared to face me
This aint a movie dawg  Nope  not Waist Deep

She givin one blood one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week ugh

All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces

Somebody go and get this nigga a pine box
And I aint just talkin bout a measly nine shots

504 gangsta New Orleans soldier
Bangin underwater fuck around and soak ya
Louisiana gunner Im bout my holster
And if you gettin greasy Im an ulcer
Im bickin back bein bool on the Eastside
Of New Orleans where the Bloods at the Bhive
Aint nothin sweet unless its Presidential
Cause that is where I sleep now give me my key
New York get the blood money  Dirty cash  still sweet
We the Black Wall Street by the swap meet with heat
Def Jam they gon flop him
And Reggaeton aint hot in the building no more
Its OKAY I get it poppin
Back to the forest trees for deep these little mes
Who took believers a opportunity to breathe
And you aint gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick
One blood we used to the spillin
Came from the hood so we used to the killin
Used to the black males makin crack sales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling
Blood in Blood out me and homie backtoback
Boatload of work and we about to pitch a shut out
Im New Yorks king Im New Yorks hardest nigga
Anything in betweens a motherfuckin target nigga
DBLOCK he spray
The hawkll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team hiphops dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen
Yeah no security Ill put you on the respirator
Im the bomb Im the motherfuckin detonator
One dutch one bud one burner one slug
Want a couple casualties but well settle for just
One blood 
What it look like  All I say at most
Shooters waitin on the word Just say it Los
I let these niggas live  Yes  I told em pull the plug
Have them goons pullin gloves leave the room full of slugs  Yes 
Catch me traffickin on marooncolored dubs  Yes 
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs  Yes 
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind ten and point em out like a lineup
Mic check one two one two  Check 
Im strapped you strapped lets play twoontwo  Lets go 
Youre eyein us in the iron bus  Boom 
Leak you two liters of red juice Hawaiian Punch  Ha 
So what you boys gon do to me  What 
Im born street your lifes sweet MTVs Laguna Beach  Damn 
Mama told me not to play with fire
But she never told me I would grow to be a lighter
One love to the gangs  Yeah  but Im in the things
Save the colors for the cars see we kill for the fame  Ross 
The boss made it yeah we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas  Ross 
Im a heavy better Im a heavy seller  Tell em 
Keep white in the office call it Jerry Heller
Lettin off a hundred rounds  Rounds  let the barrel pick  Pick 
And we gon sit here and wait for the Darryl case
Chi got Lords and Gangsters show me where them niggas at
Chi got Two Sixes and Kings show me where them killas at
Chi got them ballers and hustlers show me where them figures at

They hold cards down nigga like spades and pinochle  Nigga 
West Coast gangbang riders erasin em
Got funny niggas raisin up and riders replacin em cuz
Draped in blue notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who dont stay true
Deep down in the crevices  Woo  see them checks better win
Dwellin in the land of the gangbang profession
Im legendary yes yes a West Coaster
Throwin up two Cs with two guns in my holster  Woo 
Im from Long Beach City a Crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide  Wide  get swept away by the tide
YGs and BGs OGs its time to ride
Who the riders shooting through the gutter lane
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes  What up Blood 
From the Westside strivin to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans blue strings blowin blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chuckin up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one blood
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem  Ahhhh 
Up top born in California
Clean your clock open your can of tuna  Dootdootdoot 
Make a choice its either Hell or its Heaven
Get your chest laid out with the FN57  Bo Bo Bo 
This aint nothin to do with nobody
In the Yay there aint nothin to do but catch bodies

Im comin straight up outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say What it do they never say Holla back
Bun Beeda Im OG like 95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club off of Fairfax
Ask the Hundreds its doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and Im watchin you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it dont differ
Wipe the streets with ya like you a Swiffer as a gift
One blood
Im the realest youngsta thats breathin
And I dont gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire yall competin to be competin
My purpose is to get the cheese
And thats a purpose that youre defeatin
So shut your mouth have a seat and be quiet til Im finished eatin
My label tells me Im greedy hoggin all the room on your TV
Like Eric they think its Eazy but it isnt easy believe me
Need to make a room in BETelevision if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy I had to make room for me G
Its one blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug its still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green
I do it for my Folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standin out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack up a knot
Put your sets in the air scream Fuck the cops  Word fuck em 
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not  Thugga 
My feed mashable murders are catastrophical  Okay 
Cars is improbable Im overcomin obstacles  Okay 
Trappin I made it logical  Okay  my topic is impossible  Okay 
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux cars be tropical  Yeah yeah 
All guns choppable  Yeah  all blocks are mobbable  Okay 
Im unstoppable my Calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical kushin is now cigarable  What it is 
Redrum redrum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest wasnt talkin to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior look what the Lord gave ya
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And revivin the track like we flowin through jumper cables
What duo you know
Get XXL kudos while coppin off Julio
Yeah classic shit we mastered this
Left for dead Im back Im Lazarus
