Its Okay  One Blood  Lyrics
Dre I see dead people
Modern vampires of the city
Hunting blood
Blood
Blood
Yo Dre
Thought I was dead
West Coast
One blood one blood one blood one blood 
Im the Doctors Advocate nigga Dre shot you
Brought me back from the dead
Thats why they call him the Doctor
The Math gon drop him
And 50 aint rocking with him no more
Its okay I get it popping
Whole club rocking like a sixfour Impala
Drink Cris throw it up call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup call the shit Hpnotiq  Brrrrat 
I bleed Compton spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas aint shit but new niggas
Bathing Apeshoe niggas Im talking to you niggas
Bouncing in the sixfour throwing up Westside man
Sell another five million albums Yes I am
Fresh like Damn this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck LA above the brim
Inside the Lambo shotgun with Snoop
What would the motherfuckin West Coast be without one Crip and
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
One blood one blood one blood one blood
One blood
Im from the Westside of the sixfour Impala
Where niggas say Where you from We dont never say Harlem
Bandanna on the right side gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside
Word to Eazy Im so ill believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
Im the king and Dre said it The West Coast need me
I dont know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody know that Im the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I aint gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gon turn down the thirtyeight snub
You 38 and you still rapping Ughhh
Im 26 nigga so is the dubs
On the 07 Hummer hop out no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear all you gon see is
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
One blood one blood one blood one blood
One blood
I aint got beef with 50 no beef with Jay
Whats beef when you getting head in the sixtrey
And the double Game chain I keep em on display
Black Tshirt so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers I aint going away
I dont regret what I spit cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me they dont know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam no silencer I know when to pop
Wait til Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the numberone Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers and I climb right back to the top
Im BIG Im Cube Im Nas Im Pac
This aint shit but a warning til my album drop
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
Blood blood blood bloodbloodblood
One blood one blood one blood one blood
