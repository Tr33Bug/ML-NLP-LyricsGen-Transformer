Tell em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless  but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that Bimmer wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But Im dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard Afenis sons bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hiphop was better off when it was just Dre Scarface and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
Its a cold game nigga Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold caine thats a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange have to blow they mind Cobain
Mama forgive me cause Im tryna make a living hah
Them niggas hatin cause that Royce Phantom killing hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling hah
Me and Ye killing  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Lord willin I see a billion
Til then I let my nuts hang  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Thats the crack music nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music nigga
Im not an army Im a movement
The flow is water Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When Im talkin bout God she posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog steady postin bout her head
Got me thinking like a father is the world safe
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears sunk the Titanic
This is my life and its exactly how I planned it damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off poor kids is freezing
Cookin up in the same pot they aint got to pee in
Mama forgive me cause Im tryna make a living hah
Them niggas hatin cause that Royce Phantom killing hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling hah
Me and Ye killing  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Lord willin I see a billion
Til then I let my nuts hang  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers around greases make them cohesive
Im the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made its sorta Christlike
At the after party thinking what the afterlifes like
He paid for our sins is it really priced right
Fuck it I see the light broads they see the light
Cant deny my Jesus piece thats so Peterlike
Chicks crow for dough get low for mo
A convo piece she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle watch the chain glow
Mama forgive me cause Im tryna make a living hah
Them niggas hatin cause that Royce Phantom killing hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling hah
Me and Ye killing  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Lord willin I see a billion
Til then I let my nuts hang  Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang  Something like my Jesus piece hah
