Its motherfuckin Game time
Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
Thats how you remember it Thats how I remember it
Yeah dip into the liquor store nine in my khakis
Crips tryna get at me my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me been shot robbed stabbed chased home socked out
Jabbed by esses cops degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas when enemy dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin with Hennessey got murderous tendencies
And if you dont know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface car chase tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama shell tell you how a Blood taste
Basket case still Im back with Dre wait I never left
Run up in Beats Bitch pass the safe Compton
Produced by a billion in this motherfucker
Still smokin Dre we need a ceilin in this motherfucker
Compton They killin in this motherfucker
They grillin in this motherfucker
Lock the door they stealin in this motherfucker
No chains no rings this my home
Nigga this Hub City nofly zone
Niggas pull out burners
Start breakin like Turbo on Ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean where the needles lay
And switchblades if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lays
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on that concrete
And Im the only nigga bumpin Mobb Deep
Cause I mob deep down that side street
Cause Im a West side rider live with gats on collars
Dont hate me better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leanin on that Brougham
Flamed up like a Coke can with my name on it
Another day in Compton the thrill is high
Know somebodys watchin but I dont know why
Feel the fire burnin it touches the sky
Feel em coming at you I wont die tonight
So I get by I get by
I get by I get I get by
Cause its just another day in Compton
