June 30th 1107 I got that call
She eight centimeters my lil man bout to fall
Scuffin my Air Forces runnin through the hospital hall
Deja vu like I been here before
Im feelin reborn like a BedStuy bredren
My first born Dre Im bout to have a Bad Boy
Family in the lobby see my nigga Church whatup
Shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Runnin through the maternity ward out of breath sweatin
I swear to God every minutes startin to feel like a second
I see hell starin down the barrel of a Smith and Wesson
My sons ultrasound the closest I ever been to heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins I know its last minute
Put the chronic in the air a lil hash in it
Spread my wings if only I could fly
Why fight to live homie if we livin to die
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
Thats all I wanted for you youngn like father like son
But in the end I hope youll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you youngn like father like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming your day is coming
I tell ya and when it comes just keep it running
Running just keep it running I tell you
They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
1132 she screamin at the top of her lungs
Im panicking nurse yellin for the doctor to come
All I can remember was Lemaze class breathe baby
One  one  two  two  three  three  four  four 
I see the head Doc bustin through the door
He between the legs he see the head its my baby boy
1146 the head out she screamin makin crazy noise
Pain is love my stomach foldin like a LaZBoy
Im feelin like Mariah Carey all these butterflies
Voices singin to me sound like Teena Marie
Im callin niggas on tour
Jayo tell Spinz I just cut the umbilical cord
1157 a soldier is born
And hes flesh of my flesh young Harlem Caron


I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
Thats all I wanted for you youngn like father like son
But in the end I hope youll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you youngn like father like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming your day is coming
I tell ya and when it comes just keep it running
Running just keep it running I tell you
I wanna thank Dr Aswork and Nurse Teresa
For bringin my baby boy to life you birthed a Caesar
And my baby momma Alyska for pushin out a ten pound
Four ounce MiniMe I still cant believe it
Nose ears eyes chin just like your daddy
Id die before you grow up and be just like your daddy
Or your grandfather call Uncle Zeb
Tell him I got a son and I aint even in Harlem
Im poppin Crist witcha godfathers
Baron Davis and D Mac Darrius Rogers
Drop the top on the 71
With my face in the clouds Lord spare my son
And watch over Eric Wright Tyanna and Lil Pun
Lowridin bangin Ready to Die track 1
If I bust five times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole like the barrel of a gun
One
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
Thats all I wanted for you youngn like father like son
But in the end I hope youll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you youngn like father like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming your day is coming
I tell ya and when it comes just keep it running
Running just keep it running I tell you
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
Thats all I wanted for you youngn like father like son
But in the end I hope youll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you youngn like father like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming your day is coming
I tell ya and when it comes just keep it running
Running just keep it running I tell you
