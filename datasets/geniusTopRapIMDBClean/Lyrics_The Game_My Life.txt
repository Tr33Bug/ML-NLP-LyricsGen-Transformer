Punkass motherfucker checkin shit
What you was gonna do
Kill me in my sleep you bitchass nigga
2Pac Biggie  shut the fuck up
Fuckin dogs barkin and shit
Dont shoot dont shoot 
Fuck you nigga
And Im grindin till Im tired
Cause they said You aint grindin till you tired
So Im grindin with my eyes wide
Lookin to find a way through the day a light for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
Im just wonderin why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin right My life
Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain suicide
Im from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyns Jesus shot for no fuckin reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces
Cause thats Jesus people  and Game hes the equal
Hated on so much Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah like RocaFella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin Why why did John Lennon leave The Beatles
And why every hood nigga feed off evil
Answer my question fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle
And Im grindin till Im tired
Cause they said You aint grindin till you tired
So Im grindin with my eyes wide
Lookin to find a way through the day a light for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
Im just wonderin why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin right My life
We are not the same I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin I earned em
And I aint no preacher but heres my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson cause it aint about race now
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud and since you helped me sell my dream we can share my mama now
And like MJB no more drama now
Livin the good life me and Common on common ground
I spit crack and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate Im never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
And Im grindin till Im tired
Cause they said You aint grindin till you tired
So Im grindin with my eyes wide
Lookin to find a way through the day a light for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
Im just wonderin why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin right My life
Walk through the gates of hell see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on me and the devil sharin chronic blunts
Listenin to the Chronic album playin backwards
Shootin at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up so I cover it with a Raider hood
Im from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge  Compton Compton 
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy but I bet that new Mercedes could
Aint no bars but niggas cant escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But its real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back in my Sox hat
Im paid in full the nigga Alpo couldnt stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
Id still keep this motherfucker cocked back
And Im grindin till Im tired
Cause they said You aint grindin till you tired
So Im grindin with my eyes wide
Lookin to find a way through the day a light for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
Im just wonderin why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin right My life
