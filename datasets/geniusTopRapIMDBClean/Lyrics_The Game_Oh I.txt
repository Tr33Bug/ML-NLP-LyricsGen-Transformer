I got drunk off your love and throwed up  bleh 
Pour my heart inside your double cup
Out the park when the first batter up
I got scars from her nails when we fuck  lets go ayy 
I wanna see your boobs throwin you some Jerry beads
Black diamonds in your chain you a Merry kid
Chrome Heart clear lenses when you lurkin
Eighty thousand dollar bag you a Birkin
Workin 800 in a bag you aint worth it
Heard you dropped out of school was you workin  She workin 
No climax from your man He aint worth it
Hundred racks on purses shes mine

Late nights took her out to Maestros
She can get the lobster for the backstroke
You know how to love it when I ask though
Make a nigga feel good that its the last stroke
Oh my
You keep that to yourself
The way you do it baby
Its drivin me crazy
Oh my

The way you do it baby
Its drivin me crazy
