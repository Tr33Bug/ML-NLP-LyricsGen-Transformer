Welcome to the West and this aint The Life of Pablo
Stay on that bullshit its gon start to feel like Chicago

Ridin around 10 Cam Newtons in the Tahoe
And when we touch down everybody catchin spirals
Dressed in all black like the Panthers

So I went and dug your ass up cause Drizzy buried you first
And why you tryna pick on Wale
You told me that you dont fuck with Rozay
And YG cant give you a pass
I add 20 to your 40s put the 60s on your ass
And dont try to whine to the Grapes

You gon fuck around get tied up inside Nicki house

Waiting for the word to pump it up like Joe Buddens
Thou shall not fuck with Chuck pawns are stuck
Fold you up in boxes Armani tux
Louie sweats armor tucked
Night night use that pillow like a silencer from dawn to dusk
Get at me you niggas gon see me in gloves
Or see me in clubs with Summer Sixteen in the snub
Lying on the Internet like you aint talking to twelve
Got the cops at my door like they dropping off mail
I seen that fake paperwork on XXL
Rat niggas chew through walls and leave you in cells
Before you see me in jail you will see me in hell
You went and got the whole Philly its just me by myself
I could have went and got Kendrick went and got Snoop
Went and got Nipsey Jay Rock ScHoolboy Q
Could have went and got E40 brought Ice Cube back
And have Dr Dre screaming Meek Mill is a rat
