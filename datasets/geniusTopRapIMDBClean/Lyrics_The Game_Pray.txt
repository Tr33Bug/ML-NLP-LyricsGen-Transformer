She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle Medelln
In love with her til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon die its startin to be evident
I told her Slow down girl youre heavensent
Im a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them
And I cant let this girl throw her life away
Kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons the girl like night and day
Stressed out parents getting divorced
Girl love em both she aint tryin to sit in court
She a square so its hard to see the angle
And thats why God gave her an guardian angel
Its me and Im here for her swear to God that Im here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She aint had no pride so she went and did a year for him
She a rideordie like Eve and them
Make homecooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side now Im tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her
Takin her son and tryin to be a man to him
She dont wanna pray but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin on the door hounding me
Bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me
When I wake up every day  Even though she doubted me
I thank the Lord that we are safe  Even though she doubted me
Again yeah  Even though she doubted me
Thats why you should pray for me
Thats my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin baby daddy aint takin care of the kids
Girl you can get a hug too
Im here whenever you need me gon reach out its that easy
I love women cause without women
Wouldnt none of us niggas be breathin
So lets
Pray  Bow your head
