Throw your muthafucking Cincinnati hats in the sky nigga dont ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max 95s
I walk on the moon flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin switches til the Spring Break Cancun
Get it Nah forget it Soo Woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide I dont live in Judas eyes
Half of these rappers werent trappin when I was choppin the do or die
Suge had me in I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called told my baby momma wont you decide
She chose Doc first day I pulled dude a side
Like its Aftermath for life and all I do is ride
Before I turn on em I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground its Red Nation
Now Blood the fuck up
Every days a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I cant tell you whats good but I can tell you whats what
And thats Bs up hoes down
Lookin in the mirror Im nowhere to be found
Blood Im a dog call me a blood hound
Throwin blood in the air leave blood on the ground
Niggasll trade they soul to be Drake or J Cole
Live and die for this shit word to 2Pac Shakurs halo
One blood plural nigga Im spending Euros
Ferrari got an ice cream paint job Dorrough
Im up out the hood where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood it aint never all good
We roll up in backwoods nigga get to actin stupid
Get thrown in the backwoods Los Angeles
Home of the scandalous pimp hoes and gamblers
98 degrees on Christmas nigga we rollin cannabis
Swisha sweet aint it I told her Im Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted pulled her panties down stain it
Thats my Chilingo yeah Im bilingual
Ball by myself nigga Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here word to God


Now Blood the fuck up
Every days a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I cant tell you whats good but I can tell you whats what
And thats Bs up hoes down
Lookin in the mirror Im nowhere to be found
Blood Im a dog call me a blood hound
Throwin blood in the air leave blood on the ground
Russia got a red flag US got red stripes
Last train to Paris round the world in these red Nikes
Che Guevara of the New Era test me
Louisville slugger Yogi Berra in my new era
Got that natty on tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin with a 38 Magnum
Red Ralph Laurens the double R sittin
On a hill like Lauren her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at Roll up the weed son
So many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while Im out here I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got in some red bottoms
And all these hatin ass niggas want me dead
Cause Im Malcolm X before he turned Muslim Red
Now Blood the fuck up
Every days a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I cant tell you whats good but I can tell you whats what
And thats Bs up hoes down
Lookin in the mirror Im nowhere to be found
Blood Im a dog call me a blood hound
Throwin blood in the air leave blood on the ground
