My ambitionz of a ridadada
Put her in a YSL and that Pradadada
Keep the pistol on the sideideide
In the Lamborghini smokin on that lalala
She got her hair in the wind eyebrows on fleek
15 Bonnie  Clyde Nicki and Meek
I gave her keys to the condo keys to the Jeep
Say You jigglin baby gave her the whole damn fleet
I always ride for you baby and when shit get hard
You know I parade on the side of you baby
Yeah I met him in a dope gang he had no name
Back when you could get a half or a whole thang
Back when we all ever needed was the cocaine
Bricks in the 600 why they call me Raw Game
40 in the stidash fuck around and be roadkill
With the top down feelin like

My ambitionz of a ridadadadadadadada
My ambitionz of a ridadadadadadadada
My ambitionz of a rida
No whip now we in the Wraith road rage
Keep it gangsta pricy one of them cold things
Wit ya noooo I aint mad at ya
Get out of line probably throw a couple jabs at em
Hit Rodeo probably throw a couple bags at ya
In my 2Pac voice  I aint mad at ya
Take the wheel see if you can drive while I eat it
My fitted flew off but I dont need it tell me what I need
You need a bitch thats gonna blast spend cash with ya
Same time fuck good drop ass for you
Yeah I ride it like rahrahrahrah
Eat the pussy like lalalaaaa

Fine nigga Friday you know a nigga live this
Hit you with the helicopter tongue
Then fuck you til the helicopter come
