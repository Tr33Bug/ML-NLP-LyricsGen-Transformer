Who the fuck scared now
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
Another dead fuckin body nigga
Gangstas this is how we roll
Jesus piece and its solid gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost then its adis
Who the fuck scared now
Who the fuck scared now
Chased that nigga down put him on WorldStar
Bitch nigga got away in his girl car
Put that pussy on the net like a porn star
Another weenie with bread he a corn dog
Put three holes in his head like a bowlin ball
Im out the gutta switchin lanes in a stolen car
Fuck the feds cause a nigga got a murder charge
Fuck it though got the cover of the Murder Dog
I dress up like the pizza man load the Desert Eagle and
I dont just hit ya team I wet the whole bleachers damn
Specialize in the murder game
Documentary shit back to Hurricane
Now tell a nigga
Who the fuck scared now
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
Another dead fuckin body nigga
Gangstas this is how we roll
Jesus piece and its solid gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost then its adis

Im the most feared rap nigga
Like a Just Blaze beat I clap niggas
This aint a Just Blaze beat this aint wrapped nigga
Voletta Wallace lost her son to a gat nigga
What if I told yall I know who killed Biggie dawg
I aint no snitch but if I did it aint no biggie dawg
Cause thats Biggie dawg
All this comin out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as bein 50s dawg
But I got tired of being 50s dog
Had to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off
Whole team celebratin label on my dick hard
Interscope asking would I take 50s call
Hello Put up ten mill for a real nigga
Drop this joint album and well kill niggas
GUnit
