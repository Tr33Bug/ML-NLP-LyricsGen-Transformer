I dont read the XXL
Tote a 45 at the church think Im destined for hell oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
Its bloodshed feel the cracks in my city streets
Im from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets born in Blood nigga
In a coma five days life of a thug nigga
Momma aint show grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out just because of cuz niggas
Five shots to the head cause Im a Blood nigga
Nuttin brewing but suwooing where the fuck Im from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin down Green Leaf
No peace so dont get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger we cooking that real beef
Mommas mourning they sons Im talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals be missing your dinner now huh
Say its a blessing when you die in ya sleep
Cause the coroner dont need no sheets capisce
Im sayin stop playing wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Cant tell my grandma nothing bout her baby you crazy
I said she see no evil she dont hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now Ima see you again
And when they ask you questions you just answer
What happened then What happened then
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role to the faith that youll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my hearts desire and when I reap what I sow
I bought my momma a Benz my boobie a Jag
A car for my dogs with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud thats been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that Im not worried even when its scary
Skrrt off makin them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers dirt all of em gon is gone is burried
Shirt off when precedure resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic cause rats is what Im talking about
Im hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers the silent cries
Even though I know its an eye for an eye
I said she see no evil she dont hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now Imma see you again
And when they ask you questions you just answer
What happened then What happened then
I was born a soldier ride or die for mine
Tattooed tears and a lawyer tried to give me life
Heaven can you hear me Cause I know that hell can
So heaven can you heal me Im only just a man oh
You want to go to Compton Nigga Ill take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt buttnaked here
Respect the code a niggas calling from the pen
Colombian neckties on the outside from within
And then your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC makeup huh
Niggas cant hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 dome shots in that head Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmothers prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace
Los Angeles Im the motherfucking King here
No first 48 cause muhfuckers dont sing here huh
I said she see no evil she dont hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now Ima see you again
And when they ask you questions you just answer
What happened then What happened then
