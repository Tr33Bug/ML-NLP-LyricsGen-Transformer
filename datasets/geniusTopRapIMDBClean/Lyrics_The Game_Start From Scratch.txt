Aight the fuck are you lookin at self
You wanna piece of me
Ohh man shit
The story of my life
If I could start from scratch I wouldnt change shit
Same red bandana same fourfifth
Same Gwagon same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin up my shit
Same telephone booth same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin up in my chest
Same bloody tshirt same address
Same Dogg Food album banging in my tape deck
Homie if I can make 94 today
Id tell Eazy and Dre to bring back NWA
I wouldve told Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies fuck a rap career
Id give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles he would say
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance I would do just that
Id give anything just to go right back
Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I wouldve cut off the PS2 at 1249
Nigga Im a gangster I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later Id get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas dont wanna see you Shyne
Dre said its my turn he call it Game time
23 inch Lexanis bitches call em LeBrons
Id give my own life if I could change Gods mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole K got shot one time
That was a cool nigga I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
Its a dog eat dog world Jesus please holler back
I got a confession to make its called payback
If you dont wanna listen show me where Pastor Mae at
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance I would do just that
Id give anything just to go right back


I wouldve told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe you gotta watch where your birds lay
Wouldve told V to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I wouldve changed a couple of lines when I wrote Soldier
So I wouldnt have to live lookin over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala ridin threewheel motion
I been front to back side to side
Level my sixfour frame out keep on rollin
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this The Source sucking Benzinos dick
Tryin to be the big fish in the pond you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch you couldnt change that
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance I would do just that
Id give anything just to go right back
