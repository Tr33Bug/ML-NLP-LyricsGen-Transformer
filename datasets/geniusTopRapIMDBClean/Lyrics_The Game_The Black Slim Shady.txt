All I got is my word my dick and my MAC 10
One thing you can never have is my motherfuckin Black skin
This aint no suit that I wore
This aint a mansion a hangin plaque this aint no stupid award
So oh he goes platinum
And oh Im on the Math with him
He got all the Blackest friends
He wants to be African me
Left for dead on the Doctors Advocate
Dre never executiveproduced it I just imagined it
Oh here goes the magic tricks
Candy shops and the magic stick
DeAngelo Bailey got in shape to whoop your ass again
You depressed you just maskin it
You pop a Adderall a Vicodin and a Aspirin
But the math wasnt mathin in
So pass me the torch cause the torture in my mind
With the voice that defied rhymes will force the blind eye
To see that I was in the white Rolls Royce with five 9s
When you was pretendin to be the white Royce da 59
I just crossed a fine line
Might just force the white guy to call D12 so he can be the pork they grind swine
And the biggest rapper in Detroit that award is Sean Don
So uncork the Chardonnay and stick my fork in white wine
I never heard you in a club I never heard you in a bar
Eleven albums and ten never got played inside of my car
Id rather listen to Snitch9ine like sixtynine times
And participate in sixtynines with sixtynine nuns than listen to you
Youre a Karen call the cops tell em its a Black man on your block
With a Glock and he got it cocked
And the tattoos on his face is a star and a teardrop
He standin on a teal drop and he says he can feel Pac in the air
Like Phil Collins listen to him he still wildin
Ah Epstein chased me around Epstein island 
So silence Im Im thinkin uh mm yeah
Nothin rhymes with orange
So fickyficky Slim Shady please stand up
Shoot the fade with me Id love to put these hands up
I could 40 Glocc you unarmed
Drop the world on your head with one arm
Dear Slim Hailies with me and shes unharmed for now  Dad Im really scared 
These are the deepest secrets I keep and I be on defense
Cause Gs aint supposed to fold up
With all the facades I hold up inside of my mind I froze up
Im cold as COVID Ebola the Spanish flu and Corona
The Zika virus pneumonia is deep inside my persona
On each side of my shoulders is demons chasin Jehovah
The renegade or the soldier I really gave it to Hova  How it feel 
Twentythree years still aint penetratin the culture
You are not top five in mine BIG or Pac eyes
No Andr no Nas stop tellin white lies
Sniff a white line this the right time
I Suge Knight Vanilla Ice Im not Mr Nice Guy
Im crazy  Im crazy Im crazy 
Im crazy  Im crazy Im crazy 
Im not Mr Nice Guy
Im crazy  Im crazy Im crazy 
Dre know
Im crazy  Im crazy Im crazy 
Way to fuckin go
You done pissed off Jimmy Universal and Interscope
Know I got Jimmy Slim 50 and Universal in a scope
Cause Im shady  Shadier than him
Im crazy  Crazier than Kim
So when the Bat signal goes up in the clouds above the buildings
I hope you live long enough to see heroes turn into villains
Oh you think Im a Joker Well riddle me this
You love your mother
Well Im cleanin out your closet for you and your halfbrother
And I told you when I was in Detroit I wanna go to 8 Mile
Cause when I was little to get some MMs I had to walk eight miles
But you wouldnt leave the studio your life is on loop
Thats why Im doggy in style cause niggas rather bump Snoop
And Im a lyrical 50 cal
Leave his brain all thin wind the games all endin
The chainsaw vrin vrin
Hello Hello
Pagin Dr Dre
He aint got a lot to say
But since Curtis always do let him write the rhymes for you
Tell him to clip the wings on my butterfly tatt and force em back in the cocoon
Now does he still rap or did he have a change of heart too
The chick on the show wasnt pickin me and Mariah wasnt pickin you
So the cannons is blamblammin and if it jam then I unjam it
And wipe down my stripper pole with the hair grease from your bandana
You wish you was Santana or Cam in them 10 Js
Durag for ten years and never had one wave
And I was that runaway slave that they buried in that one grave
And some say he would back to haunt Slim Shady one day
Now Im here hope you ready this is not moms spaghetti
This your dad was twentytwo when he ate lil Debbie
He takes the cake
Cause she was only fifteen so how could one not sympathize with her havin you as a teen
She had to lose herself in the moment give up her dreams
Just to see her son out here lookin like a wigger in jeans  Yeah 
Little Marshall Mathers
Mad cause nobody thinks that little Marshall matters
That sentiments hard to gather
Lets get this shit all together the picture was ripped I fixed it
But none with me you and 50 lets stitch this shit all together
You like it Slim
I made it just for you
I even kidnapped Stans brother and baited him here for you
But you would just say No
Probably leave us in the blistering cold
God made you damn near perfect he just missed your soul
You aint the shell of who you used to be
And after you its me on the Uzi spree like its two of me
And Matthews dead now its just you and me
The sweatpants the dad hat durag and no jewelry
Umm is that cultural appropriation
Ask Paul if its even appropriate for me to make that statement rude of me
How your day went
Did you redye your beard or get another face lift or do shrooms in your moms basement
Until you nod and see spaceships
And the aliens inside it come and tell you your talents wasted
Then you wake up and you aint shit
I know you fiendin for a Dr Dre bass hit
How ironic an addict in a basement
And now I chronic cause I done had it with the fake shit
You never understood ebonics or a cadence
I press everything like a weight bench
And every time the plate hits you off another playlist
Sorry it aint workin out
Niggas shootin Billy Blanks  Its my winners speech 
While Im here I should really thank MGK UGK Tech N9ne Uzi spray
My other twelve personalities wasnt really in the mood today
Hi kids heres somethin funny lets all say Nigga once
Crashed the car hit and run
Jumped out hid the gun
Your fans want a rap god well fuck it Ima give em one
I came to put Slim in a box but he already live in one
Mr Shady dont be shady
Pick that pen up dont be lazy
Call up Dre and get that Dre beat
Jump off stage if shit get crazy
Mr Shady dont be shady
Pick that pen up dont be lazy
Call up Dre and get that Dre beat
Jump off stage if shit get crazy
