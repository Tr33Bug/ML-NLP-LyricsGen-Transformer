See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
Tell them mothafuckas Im forever paid
California king wrestle gators in that Everglade
Drive up out that mothafuckin swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin rsum
Started off on Ground Zero then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole  I never hesitate
Dre Beats on smokin that chronic just to meditate
Ima give em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight Im Aftermaths heavyweight
Now Dres weapon of mass destruction is bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me shit I was sellin weight
Now a niggas sellin millions now its time to celebrate
Performin in front of millions nigga every race
64 in the 64 now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album no five mics Then let em hate
But Im not stoppin till Im the fuckin king in every state
Recognize my life ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record Ima wreck it even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart nigga fuck your feelings this is me
Im sick of mothafuckas talkin about the West died
Cant you hear my heart beatin Thats the motherfuckin Westside
You test me you test God Im His son
It say in Psalms you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You wont have no time to run
Im from the Compton slums and thats how the West ride
Im from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of em spit like Im the ghost of em
Damn I said I spit like Im the ghost of em
Name your top 10 Im harder than the most of em
Matter of fact shorten your list nigga top 5
Game Biggie Hov probably Pac Nas
No particular order bet a mill that I slaughter
And serve niggas give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When Im the nigga sold 5 mill out the gate and numbers do not lie


Recognize my life ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record Ima wreck it even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart nigga fuck your feelings this is me
I gave you The Documentary shit was a classic
Gave you Doctors Advocate you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out torn between Aftermath and
Geffen Interscope now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper its like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin for
Im the lost angel knockin on Satans door
What the fuck yall take me for
I love you cause you hate me more
Im Kobe on the Lakers floor except I give you 84
Shake you like Haitis floor
Walk up on you like Whats goin on baby boy
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either Im crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen no disrespect to Calvin
Recognize my life ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record Ima wreck it even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart nigga fuck your feelings this is me
Kendrick and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down knowin damn well
We dont wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime Thug Life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin when the LA Raiders
Was in my home snapback fitted on my uncles dome
And I dont condone dickridin
Im addicted to Westsidin
Livin in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly but it turned me to a lion
Tryin and I mean that shit
Game came through put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadnt seen that shit
Compton  a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial never TVscreened that shit
Cant block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit
Red is a very emotionally and intense color It enhances human metabolism increases respiration rate and raises blood pressure It has a very high visibility which is why stop signs stop lights and fire equipments are usually painted red It also represents one third of Californias gang population Needless to say please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area Also tuck your jewellry and keep your hands inside your vehicle Thank you Enjoy it
