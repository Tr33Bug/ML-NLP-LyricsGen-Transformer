Hahahah ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength of Aftermath
Straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game bitch Hahahaha
Yeah Yeah mothafuckas
Comptons back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game lets go
Me and Marshall aint start shit they listen to our shit
Then talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
Im tryna feed my son and drop multiplatinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and Pac was we saw the throne was empty
And decided to chase it me him and 50 racin
This rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say step in the booth and onetake it
How could I not sell a million when Im rappin on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we cant even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin I can taste this swear to God I aint racin
Put the clip in and waste em before I go out on that fake shit
Im so sick and tired of this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit Em they aint gon like this
So they callin us
We aint goin
Nowhere so fuck you
We aint goin
Nowhere so fuck you
This day the game will never be the same  we aint goin 
Things just aint the same for gangstas
The game just isnt the same its changing  we aint goin 
Its a new game Youre now about to witness the power
Nowhere so fuck you
Only Dre can judge me for the mistakes Im making
If Im faking Im Clay Aiken
You aint 50 and you aint Game you lame youre tame bitch
Youre mild sauce you aint ready to make that flame switch
Youll end up in the same situation same shit
Different day just with different gangstas in your face which
Way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what youll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
In my face looking for answers rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victims penis up his ass a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act you bastards wasting
Too much time me no kiss ass and if thats the case then
We aint going


We aint goin
Nowhere so fuck you
We aint goin
Nowhere so fuck you
This day the game will never be the same  we aint goin 
Things just aint the same for gangstas
The game just isnt the same its changing  we aint goin 
Its a new game Youre now about to witness the power
Nowhere so fuck you
Lo get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em just killed me on my own shit
Im walking through 8 Mile startin to get home sick
Ima do Shady numbers Im ridin my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick the windows tinted
If Eminem is in it body armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix Ill throw your demo out the window
For telling me its hot when its not and you got
What you got from them rocks on the block you just stopped
Telling Dre you got shot with a Glock that dont fade me
Im crazy why the fuck you think Im rhyming with Shady
I dont care if the radio dont play me I say
What I say when I feel like Im feeling today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I cant even take my son to cop them GUnit sneaks
So Im gone bitch
We aint goin
Nowhere so fuck you

Nowhere so fuck you
This day the game will never be the same  we aint goin 
Things just aint the same for gangstas
