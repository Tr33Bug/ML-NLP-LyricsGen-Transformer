For you baby Id find you
For you baby Id find you
For you baby Id find you
I done been around the world been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and Pac
Like Vida Guerra ass took her to the top
Shell give you some brain you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain shell throw you some cot
Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said its a wrap she still on the set
Puttin oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she  Wouldnt get far  cause five hundred dollars
Cant get you that  Far  how you get that  Far 
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they dont know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards ha ha
You wouldnt get far  fuckin them rap stars
You know who you are put your hands up ladies
You wouldnt get far  if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time 
But you know  You wouldnt get far  fuckin them rap stars
You know who you are I wrote this song for you
For you baby Id find you for you and you for all yall
Pop quiz how many topless black foxes
Did I have under my belt like boxers
Not to brag but if it add up
One two nigga thats mad nuts
Game you mad nuts how you gon call out all these
Bitches knowin damn well they gon call me
The only dream of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he dont ask for a pre nup
Now ask yourself this question umm
Would you be with JayZ if he wasnt CEO
Would you be with FABO if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with NeYo if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin at me fo
But since they all fall in my palm I take a trio yo


You wouldnt get far  fuckin them rap stars
You know who you are put your hands up ladies
You wouldnt get far  if you kept your mouth closed
It would be just a waste of time 
But you know  You wouldnt get far  fuckin them rap stars
You know who you are I wrote this song for you
For you baby Id find you for you and you for all yall
I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley droptop
In Miami Beach when Lil Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops whatever the case
Shell let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And aint nobody tryin to take Beyonc from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six fo
Impala forget the double Ds
I put em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she aint win the show but she ridin in that Gallardo
Thats why I fuck em today and forget em tomorrow
You wouldnt get far  fuckin them rap stars
You know who you are put your hands up ladies
You wouldnt get far  if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time 
But you know  You wouldnt get far  fuckin them rap stars
You know who you are I wrote this song for you
For you baby Id find you for you and you for all yall
