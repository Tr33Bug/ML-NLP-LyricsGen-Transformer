My diamonds and the Lex say its time to flow
Wonder how I got rich they say I rhyme too slow so
Im from the O I go for what I know
And like I told your ass before you can fuck my ho
I ride nuthin but vogues aint hittin no switches
Top down in my Caddy just me and my bitches
With a Ziplock bag full of green weed

Of some dank smoke all up in my chest
Dangerous Crew got the bomb we dont smoke that stress

Never love a bitch or a ho
You fell in love with her though trying to get in them pants
And the next thing ya know your baby mommas a tramp

Now your stomachs upset and your feelings are hurt
She gotcha looking like an old banana peel in the dirt
Bitch slipped up and hit your ass for a lick
Talking that mother fucking baby shit
Youz a punk ass nigga cant you see
Thatz the difference between niggas like you and me

Lights camera action cut
Hollywood look out the bitch is coming up
She took acting classes bout to be on her way
On a Greyhound bus from home to LA
She said it wouldnt take long to make it to the top
A few auditions land a job
I was down in LA hit the club for a drink
Im a player ass nigga tell me what do ya think
I walked up to the bitch in my clean ass suit
And I told her Ive been watching you
I peeped you out from the bar
You must be a model or a movie star
She said No but thats my dream
To see my face on the movie screen
I tell ya nothing but game came out my mouth
She was talking bout agents I was turning her out
I said Listen real close to what Im saying
All you need is me you dont need no agent
Im a pimp ass nigga and the game dont stop
All you gotta do is fuck a few big shots
Cause if you cant do that theyre going to hold ya back
She was sucking up the game down to do all that
She said Short baby I aint no simp
But the nigga in the suit aint nuthin but a pimp
And all them white guys you had sex with
They werent big shots they were nothing but tricks
She came to me and said it just wont last
I looked and I laughed and I kicked her ass
Cuz all she wanted was the fame
But you cant get shit when you dont have game

Guerilla pimps just dont quit
I say mother fuck you damn shithead bitch
