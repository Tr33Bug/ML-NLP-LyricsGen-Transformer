I go on and on
Cant understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated do the math
I made 1000 songs that made you move your ass
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And Im still gon yell it every time you see me in
Whats my favorite word
BITCH
Why they gotta say it like hort
BITCH
You know they cant play on my court
Cant hang with the big dogs
Stay on the porch
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Where you get that from
Grab the mic spit one let me hit that blunt
PimpC 8Ball and MJG
Keep spittin that P to the IMP
BunB thats Texas baby
Ball and G thats Memphis baby
hort Dog thats Oakland baby
Aint nothin but pimpin these days G
My nigga C got locked up
But these real hoes still know they gots to fuck
Give a fuck nigga what you say
hort Dog fuck with UGK
Do you really wanna be like me
Spit game like Snoop and TIP
Pretty girls in the VIP
They came with Dre they dont need ID
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle


Your mind is gone
Your brain is blazed
Youve been wide awake for the last 3 days
Poppin pills
It goes down for real
Dont stop just keep rollin down hill
Crash and burn cant stand fall back
Youre doin too much you cant handle all that
Man its been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me my shit gets around
Leave the country come back and hit The Town
Im in Miami New York and ATL
Houston and LA ask Dave Chappelle about my rich bitch
He got it from me
And made 50 million dollars
Im proud of you D
But Im crazy you dont wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Bitch
Too hort
Up All Night baby
Album number 16
