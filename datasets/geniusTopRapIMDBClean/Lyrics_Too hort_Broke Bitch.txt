Whassup baby
Damn like that Cant even speak
I aint tryin to fuck just tryin to holla say whassup
Let me ask you somethin baby
Is that a wig or a weave
What you see is what you get
If you dont like it fuck you bitch
You look good you hot as shit
But you broke as hell and aint got no whip
I aint yo type I dont care
Get a lightskinned nigga with long hair
I spoke you act like you mad at a dude
I dont give a fuck bout your bad attitude
Its in me  Im laced with game
You get a signed autograph with a face to blame
Tear it up later when you hate my guts
Right now I wanna make you taste my nuts
You hella fine but I dont wanna keep in touch
All I wanted was to sleep with a slut
I wanna fuck you bitch cause you got the look
A top notch but you aint too hot to be shook
BROKE BITCH You cant fuck with me
You cant afford me
BROKE BITCH You cant even afford a happy meal from McDonalds
BROKE BITCH Five dollars worth of gas
Where you goin cross the street
BROKE BITCH
You just wanna marry a million dollar ballplayer
BROKE BITCH
You wanna get you a nigga in the NFL
A basketball player tall as hell
You might get lucky marry the champ
But when you walk by they say theres a tramp
Your stock is low you dont know what happened
Yo baby daddy is low budget rappin
You wanna do it big spoil the kid
But youre still at the club out hoein an shit
You tryin to hit a lick  no doubt
You want diamonds all you get is dick in your mouth
Bitch you need to stop and think
You act like a dick is a slot machine
Are you serious You cant be thinkin clear
Its quicksand bitch youll sink in here
You wanna be rich better stop that shit
You never hit the jackpot
BROKE BITCH Yeah we tryin to get top notchers
Nobody want your busted ass
BROKE BITCH Quit buyin all them knockoff purses and clothes bitch
BROKE BITCH Always starin at the ground
You need to hold your head up
BROKE BITCH If you had some money you wouldnt be wearin them
Raggedyass shoes
BROKE BITCH
Theres too many women cant stop a player
I see one I like Ima stop and stare
I dont need plans Ima take the chance
I dont even have to ask the bitch to dance
Im a natural I dont need luck to win
Im the kind of nigga thatll fuck your friend
And you wont know nothin every time I see her
On the low we fuckin I know them buttons
And I hit em most of the time I get em
I got a million lines and I spit em
When I wanna fuck who do I like to call
I throw a little party and invite em all
They never argue and fight with a brother
And I like when they like each other
I told Polow Im never gettin married
I dont give a fuck if you was fuckin Sherri
