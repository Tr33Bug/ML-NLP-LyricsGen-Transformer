Eastside beotch
Yeah you know about that real players
The real ones
I burn rubber on you quick as hell
You need some toilet paper dont shit on yourself
When you see me rollin in luxury
I wont fuck witchu so dont fuck with me
Im just ridin sidin whippin and dippin
I look at all the young hoes trippin
Its no big deal when little hotties get hot
When niggas get jealous somebody get shot
You in love Might make you lose your mind
Thats why I run these gray girls two at a time
With no discretion to me youre so depressin
Actin like you dont know my profession
I look at them thighs and look at them titties
Take your ass straight on out of Sin City
Wearin all pink just like Hello Kitty
Bringin back all Cnotes and no fifties
scratched so damn fresh word
Burnin rubber on these bitches so fast
Burn rubber as you smash all fast
Tell it like hort no ass no pass
All you Santa Claus players be on your way
With a bag full of toys on the back of your sleigh
You hit your girls house one by one
Climb down the chimney and give em all somethin
You trick dont come around me frontin
Talkin bout how you pimpin givin hoes what they wantin
You worse than a studio gangsta
Behind closed doors gettin his bootyhole spanked up
You suckers disrespect the game
All these video hoes out there spittin your name
You love it when they make that ass clap
But she dont give me no cash Ill pass it back
I kick her where she stash the crack
In the plastic sack when she crash the llac
Punk bitch
scratched so damn fresh word
They tryin to give the rap game to some real punks
Its just like when disco killed the funk
Cant tell me nothin when I know Im right
Like a bowlegged bitch with a overbite that suck it right
Player this pimp dont lie
How many porn stars you know that went to Crenshaw High
A lot of fuckin for a whole lot of nuttin
You just wannabe noticed so youre out there sluttin
I never really cared about popular fame
Its all about sittin on top of the game
So dont stop til your panties drop
Fuck the mayor the preacher and a cop
You better tell him what it cost get his mind on track
Cause he look like he lost
Bring him back and dig in his pockets quick
Steal his watch and make sure he got a drop beotch

scratched so damn fresh word
