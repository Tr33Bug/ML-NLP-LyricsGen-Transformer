City of dope I call it Oak
Cant be broke selling coke
Fat ropes shattered hopes
Fresh cars and all that dope
Baseheads keep the trade alive
Nobody knows bout a 9 to 5
Everybodys just tryna survive
You need a gun cant use those knives
You got a bullet Well just pull it
And if you trip get pistolwhipped
By a psychomaniac sick in his head
Wanna be a gangster and now hes dead
His brother took over aint no sweat
Bought a new droptop white Corvette
Now hes buying keys making Gs
And all the girls say Wont you please take me
In the city of dope
See Im hard as hell no ghetto tale
You play a gun but the game is real
You wanna stop my money how
You keep smoking Im selling out
Its called the city of dope might be your town
Get a piece of the rock turn your life around
So cool dont even trip
You got the sack get on the tip
A resident in the city of dope
And every day Im selling coke
Im never broke I dont smoke
I sold a rock and made you have a stroke
Pay me cold cash you know I wont need Bruno
Ill hit you with my gat and then I wont come back
Like my peanut butter top with the candy paint
All the high school tenders drop down and faint
In the city of dope
Life in a coke town heard it before
Think its all been said but theres so much more
Its like midnight slanging rocks
Task force just hit the block
Time to make a move the spot got hot
You chase a cop homeboy why not
She lit the match and light the crack
Aint giving no bitches no kind of slack
Or if youre playing the game then youre thinking the same
Goddamn that rock cocaine
I see a lot of my friends gone off that pipe
And every night smoke coke thats white
So when you get up man there you go
You and that pipe just dogging the hoes
In the city of dope and the story goes
Want to be like free breaking millions of loaves
In the city of dope where the color is gold
On your neck and your fingers and your brand new Rolls
Enough said but my rap wont end
Its on a one way trip to San Quentin
Like you my friend aint nothing new
You want to grind that boat til its way past two
You say its not easy but youre so hard
Sporting gold tone Zs not credit cards
Got clout turn em out you got bitches
You say youre not fake but Im telling you this is
The city of dope might be your world
Get a beeper homeboy and just sell that girl
Im from the town called the city of dope
It couldnt be saved by John the Pope
So go on live your life of crime
The beatll keep beating while I say my rhyme
In the city of dope


Smoking weed rolling em fat
You wonder where the boy learned to act like that
He was raised in the ghetto and felt the need
To roll a fat joint and smoke that weed
But the tale goes on and years went by
Another drug came and the boy got high
Ever since that day he just wasnt the same
Where I come from we call it rock cocaine
Where you come from you might call it crack
But wherever he went you see he never came back
I tried to tell the motherfucker but he dont know
I say to coke Pimp that ho
I dont live in a mansion but I drive a Benz
Cut to the turf and collect my ends
Say Look here freak kick me down
I dont have time to talk right now
Got to go to my next ho
And get kicked down a little more
Left right left down the street
Getting paid freak by freak
There you see me there you dont
You wonder will I or wont
Is it yes Is it no
But does it really matter you freaky ho
In the city of dope
