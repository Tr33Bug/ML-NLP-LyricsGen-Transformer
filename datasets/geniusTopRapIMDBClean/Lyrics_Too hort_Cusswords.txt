So you motherfuckers thought I was gonna change my style
So what are you saying Todd
To all you bitches hoes and all that shit
Heres another rap that Im ready to spit
It goes like this my name is hort
Im tearing shit up like never before
Pimp slaps making snaps
Cold cash money and Too hort raps
Oakland California thats where Im from
The city where the boys say you dont want none
But if you do Im gonna tell you this
Trues and Vogues aint really shit
Wanna roll so hard all of the time
You and that bitch playing Too hort rhymes
If you ask me what its all about Ill say its about that money
But if you ask me could you have some Ill say it doesnt concern me
Ronald Reagan came up to me and said Do you have the answer
To the US economy and a cure for cancer
I said What are you doing in the White House if youre not selling cocaine
Ask your wife Nancy Reagan I know shell spit that game
Like one night she came to my house and gave me a blow job
She licked my dick up and down like it was corn on the cob
What is life Life is Too hort
I play young bitches like its a sport
Yeah I play the bitches just like yall
Like Dr J played basketball
You can call me Too dont say it twice
Youll get me real mad and Ill fuck your wife
You see Im not proper Im rarely polite
Too hort Too hort dont say it tonight biatch
It started on a bright morning in 1987
I was in my droptop Caddy yall
Getting sucked by a bitch named Helen
Nasty bitches around the world I wrote this rhyme for you
You might not like my rap but Im telling you bitch its true
So much death in the Oakland streets
Am I gonna live till next week
Will I get shot by a dope fiend
Trying to get high trying to steal my ring
I really cant say cause I dont know why
People out here dropping dead like flies
I used to see a home boy give him five
Now I say Man you still alive
Cold as hell this town Im from
Wont last too long when youre faking the funk
Im the master rapper so unique
Clap my hand when I want my freak
You cant deny it you know Im right
I turn any rapper out when Im on the mic
And I wont kick back or relax
Till he knows Im the best at the MC rap
Till he knows Too Short set the trap
That got him caught up in my serious cap
Motherfucker cant spit straight game on the mic
Cause hes worse than a fag or a Frisco dyke
Hes a sucker MC I call him punk
Trying to spit that rap you can scratch that junk
You little punkass boy wouldnt listen to me
Think Im faking but Im taking all you sucker MCs
To the end of the world and push you over
Good luck couldnt find you in a four leaf clover
If I ever said a rap trying to cap on you
I wouldnt even sweat it cause youll be through
Looking so far up you might fall down
Getting clowned by the hound from east Oaktown
And the look in your face when youre looking at Too
Could make a grown man die laughin at you
Cause youre a no rappin no rhymin
Played out fake ass Simple Simon
I never understood one word you said
But youre swearing up and down that youre killing me dead
Theres only one thing I wanted to know
Sucker motherfucker wheres the joke
Im the player of players just call me Pop
My name is Too hort no I dont stop
I just dont stop mackin dont stop cappin
Dont stop rappin now you see what happens
Your mind is gone your crew just cut
Sucker MC Ill tell you what
Your rhymes are weak your rap the same
And when it comes to game you are lame
Never even heard of Too hort baby
Hit Oakland in 1980
Singing more raps than a rap could rhyme
Telling sucker MCs dont waste my time
Theres a girl I know her name is Betty
Straight to the head just rock it steady
Shes so freaky shell juice you up
All the home boys just cant get enough
Shes a PhD dont even stop
In the back like that going chop chop chop
I wont say white girl wont say shes black
Shes the kind of girl that make your knees go crack
Feel the beat rock with me
Let me tell you what I be
Im a MC rapper a MC rapper
A big bank roller and a cold cold capper
Hey baby I got this rhyme
Its not gonna stop till the end of time
Like rock and roll Ill play that song
To the beat all day and all night long
So listen up to what Im saying
Im a Oaktown mack bitch I aint playing
To all the home boys doing time in the pen
Gonna rock this beat for you once again
If you cant get out and youre mad as hell
Say beeatch now make it sound for real
Imma tear shit up if I get the chance
I could give a fuck less if your ho dont dance
See Im a big mack now Im so great
I was born and raised in the Golden State
Call me TOO if you say hort
Imma rap my ass off till you give me some more
Big bank now just make me rich
Bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
Check out my style baby I dont quit
I heard this freak say Thats the shit
He took the cake fucked the rake
Too hort baby damn sure aint fake
But the sucker MCs are screaming loud
Saying Sir Too hort shut your mouth
How can you talk about me and call me weak
When your father smokes coke and your mothers a freak
So I keep on rappin if nothing else
Keep your jealous ass thoughts to yourself
Picture this hes a MC right
Aint saying nothing but hes holding the mic
Fuck with me and boy youre doomed
Ill send a trick with a ho to the motel room
Cause Im the coldest MC on a microphone
Like a 357 pointed at your dome
I got cap for cap you never heard
So fresh again with cusswords
Motherfucking shit fucking with me
Fuck a skank bitch and a sucker MC
All you bastards got the claps
And fuck you punk cause you still cant rap
Cusswords just let em roll
Motherfucking shit God damn asshole
Cusswords just dont quit
Motherfuck you damn shithead bitch
Its Too hort on the mic and it dont stop
And it dont stop and it wont stop beeatch
Check out my style
