Say ho
Yeah you
Can I ask you a question
You like to fuck
Oh you dont want me to talk to you like that
Would you like to make love
I saw you walking down the street and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good and youre so fine
Young tender would you be mine
I get you in my car drive you to my house
Cuz Im a mack I cold turn you out
I wont ask and I sure wont beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties straight go to work
What time is it Dont watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and Ill rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am and I always can Freak Nasty
Im the man
I take you out to the finest restaurant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers Ill buy your ass a rose
But later on youre coming off with them pantyhose
You want gold girl whats next
Its me and you doing the sex
So now you know Im just a freak
Give it up baby I cant wait two weeks
I want it all Dont say I wont
Get it girl now Im telling you dont
Nigga please you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot the girls of whom youre dealing
We havent the urge to get busy
Like those dizy lizys who used to dance for you your through
I cant put it more blunt your vocab is restricted
Youre addicted to the words you inflicted
Time after time line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you hort because of your height or your width
Diss me boy Ill hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky your a dinky
Its an easy task to the corner cause the curb didnt want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth you dont brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass classyou cant pass your simply trash
Your a typical nigga the kind you dont take home
This is Entyce and Barbie from the Danger Zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch twitch dont you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it


Get mad if you want I wont front
When its time to hump wont be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too hort baby all in them guts
Im not your ABC from the alphabet
Every letter Ill writell get your pussy wet
Its just a freaky note from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
Im a player bitch I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes now its your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Wont sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby You know what I want
Your acting like its that time of the month
Are you bleeding cant think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We dont need to kiss we dont have to fuck
Ill pull out my dick bitch you can suck
Now here dont say I wont
Get it girl now Im telling you dont
Punk Im not a tease Im not a skeezer
And most definately not a dick pleaser
You dreaming and scheaming and fiending for my lust
You dont have enough for you I feel disgust
Wait small thing I hate
For goodness sakes if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
Im not talking bout your height weight or what you dream
When I say too short you know what I mean
You see I need man not a boy to approach me
Your lame game really insults me
Your name is Too hort or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey you wouldnt have a penny
Little boy your not a player
Im your savior
To try to get at me shows audacious behavior
Ive got to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy heres a proposition
You wanna bit of danger Step into my zone
You call yourself a dogg thatz how Ill send you home
With your tail between your legs screeching and whining
Dare to say you got some Nigga please your lying
Cause to fight the feeling there would have to be one
And mathmatically me plus you equals none
I am the rapper that they call 4tay
Im gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then its cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang but she said no
Thats about as far as its going to go
So I toss and turn to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say oh thats nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep thats how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you aint with it
The rest of you freaks just wont admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Aint nobody tripping cuz I know Im right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really dont take too long
But a white girls always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze but its just a tease
Give her some time shell be on her knees
Then Ill pick her up so I can work the butt
Baby I just wanna try to bust a nut
But dont get me wrong cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a camisole
But when its time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight dont want to serve it
Gave it some time so make up your mind
Dont fight the feeling its time to unwind
You was talking bout you gunna give my some
But Im Rappin 4 Tay it dont make me none
Yeah man the little hoes got ill
So now its time to get way too real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank ho
Go get your bank ho
My little dickll have you screaming no
Because when it comes to sex you dont know whats up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See Im a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts not big mouths
I know some little girlsll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down give you some head
But little girl you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point I really cant say shit
Aint dropping no lines Ill just call you a bitchBeyotch
