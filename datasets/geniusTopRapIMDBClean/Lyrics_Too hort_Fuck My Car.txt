Lets go ridin sidin whippin and dippin
I know its my car bitch you aint trippin
Its your favorite color on a lovely day
You let me reach right over and rub on your leg
Im sayin all kind of shit to make you smile
Put your seatbeat on cause I be drivin wild
You think Im like them other niggas I just wanna fuck
But I like to get money and get my dick sucked
I aint your average everyday little ho nigga
And I can see through you bitch youse a gold digger
Tellin me stories about the richest man
But Im Too hort baby the bitchs pimp
I come a long way from young and done the certified player
I get what I want and Imma holler at you later
If you aint got game you might think Im a trick
Dont play yourself girl you wont get no dick
I take you right back home so you can be witcha man
I know you sucker motherfuckers wont understand
See me with a bitch and say I floss too hard
These hoes aint trippin on me they wanna fuck my car
Now whether on the strip or in the bar
If you put your mind to it you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She aint trippin on you shed rather fuck your car
She could care less about a real man
All she wants is a man with the meal plan
Pick her up in the Benz and hope she get to eat
Every day is Halloween ho trick or treat
I throw your ass in the trunk with a bag of rats
Drop you off at Kaiser like they did in The Mack
I know youre broke fantasizing like Mariah
Get a grip on my bumper rub your clit on my tire
You can ride on top or wrap your legs around the frame
But if you get in this car you gonna respect this game
And Im knowin that I hope you know it too
Only real pimps know what Im goin through
Its a daily mission controllin these bitches
Uphold the pimpin never start sympin
Got the cleanest drop Caddy for your eyes to see
So cmon bitch and take a ride with me
Now Im about big blocks drop tops
White guts ending with much knock
Got loot but dough aint even trippin on it
Got keys to three hundred Zs knowin these bitches
Now whether on the strip or in the bar
If you put your mind to it you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She aint trippin on you shed rather fuck your car
I gave you a ride for some head cause my dick was soft
But if you aint widdit Imma drop you off
I got hoes all around me all day and night
And yo little pussys just way too tight
For a big black dick like mine to slide in
I take my motherfuckin time and ride it
Cause aint no punk bitches where Im from
They like to suck niggas dicks and make us cum
So get buttnaked let me slap that ass
Play with them titties while I tap that ass
Slam your face in the pillow and arch that back
Have you lovin this dick like its made of crack
Cocaine and you know that costs
Cant fuck for free you got to pay the boss
Hundred dollar bills bitch
I break your ass and wont feel shit
Cause pimpin pimpin thats my game
I got it from the O where it always rains
Pimp game now its time to roll
And take my hoes down to the ho stroll
Now whether on the strip or in the bar
If you put your mind to it you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She aint trippin on you shed rather fuck your car
You aint slammin doors like me cause Im the coldest mack
From a brand new Benz to my old school llac
You aint never gon stop my pimpin style
Its like two plus two can you figure it out
You say what fo I say thats right
You know the answer nigga pimpin for life
Whats a trick to a ho some dope to a fiend
Whats a bag of weed if the shit aint green
You say the game is forever well so am I
You only got two choices bitch ho or die
Now speak up you better say somethin
Before I turn your ass back into a pumpkin
Cause aint no motherfuckin fairy tales
Only Freaky Tales and I tell em so well bitch
Now get your ass in the car
Dont play me too close I wont pimp you too hard
Now whether on the strip or in the bar
If you put your mind to it you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She aint trippin on you shed rather fuck your car
repeat 2X
