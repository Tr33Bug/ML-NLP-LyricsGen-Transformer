Get in where you fit in fool
You was a mark up at the high school
Now youre hardcore like CB4
Biting what you wanna be me for
Its your life you wish it was a Too hort rap
But you gots no game and your bass aint fat
You need to quit rapping just aint your place
So back on the grind and dont catch no case
Bitches thats what you always be
Like the other young bitches that try to get with me
I run all up in it but this aint no race
I pull it out and shoot it right in her face
You probably wine her and dine her
And get jealous when you cant find her
Youre nothing but a mark
I bet you get your ass kicked hanging at the park bitch
Youd better watch your back
Before you get jacked by a nigga with a gat
Cause Life is Too hort Im In the House like that
Shorty the Pimp was Born to Mack
And I dont stop rapping one thing I never do
Is stop making this funkyass shit to ride to
And other rap crews can see
Dangerous Crew got the funky beats
And when I see ya and act like I dont know ya
Im like Missouri cause I can show ya
Why is my shit so funky it stanks
Pee Wee Shorty B and Ant Banks
You outta pocket trying to hang with my crew
You might of just learned but it aint nothing new
What happened to your funk did you lose it
Or did you get juked by Dangerous Music
We stole all your money and all your songs
Done you like a ho and then sent your ass home
One punk came and went
Had to fire the ho but Im still a pimp
MC  Lawrence  The fake gangsta 
Wouldve never been shit without the BadAss Banksta  The little punk 
Now hes gonna play on out  Like a mark 
Had to put his fat foot in his mouth  Little bitch 
Quick to say Im sorry when youre funny
Yall can have him cause Dangerous dont want him
Hell tell a lie almost every other minute
Im like Bennett I aint in it
Go on with your reject rap attack
Youll get more from a prize in a Cracker Jack
And since Banks said he cant have no more funk  Hell naw 
Get in where you fit in punk

Cause the motherfucking turf is the place to be
Where hella niggas get shot at
So youd better pop back or your ass getting dropped black
Cause niggas lay you on your back fast
So youd better grab a gat and pop a cap in they black ass
And let loose the whole clip
And let these motherfuckers know that you aint taking no shit
I mean you gotta be a nut fool
And you cant give a fuck you can cut nigga fuck school
Because that shit dont even last long
Get a key from an OG and get your fucking cash on
And if a nigga got some grip get your gank on
But if a nigga popping lip get your bank on
Dont ever go out like another sucker
You gotta show everybody that you the baddest motherfucker
Show them niggas you the biggest boss
And aint no slipping stopping the tripping just popping
A clip and breaking them niggas off
Cause see life aint nothing but just riches to me
Getting high with my partners and bitches to see
Yep thats what life is all about
You eating the cunt and she sucking your dick and you
Fucking that bitch and kicking that bitch up out
I aint a model and I dont play the fucking role
Dont be shit when youre old nigga fuck a goal
You wanna be somebody I tell your ass you cant
You little bad motherfucker go on and hit the dank
Thats how it is in the Oaktown
These motherfuckers didnt know Well these motherfuckers know now
And dont be jealous and mad we doing shit
Cause I dont give a fuck Im from the BadNFluenz clique


You wanna follow in my footsteps well put on your gangsta hat
Burn the sack and dont be ashamed to mack
Im bout to tell you how a true player has to be
The shit comes naturally so hoes quit asking me
I never listened and used to cuss in back of the church
Bracking the Max is my birth packing a gat on the turf
Ready to drop any sucker on contact
You cant keep me calm black so pass me the bomb sack
And watch me extend with a grin to another place
I live on the edge and the Feds and the brothers space
But aint no stopping this fool Im on a rampage
Breaks out in a damn rage so dont try to stand break
Sit in the range youll get maimed I dont fight fair
Strike with a mic in a psyche is a nightmare
And Im always using my dick cause Im slick with a fly bitch
And Rappin ass Ron is my psychopath sidekick
Two hardhead niggas yeah we advocate violence
Talking shit to the world cause we dont have to stay silent
Steady searching for a bad plan thinking like a mad man
Your crew think they tight but when I come they a sad clan
So fuck it Im always causing ruckus
Whoever wanna disagree then grab my dick and suck it
Diddley is always doing shit distructive and I ruin shit
You stepping pack your weapon fucking with the BadNFluenz clique
Fuck it its just another nigga dead
I pulled the trigger and I figure lead thats when the nigga bled
Bloodshed is what I see in the nighttime
Strange and deranged I aint in my right mind
I cant relate Im stuck in a dream state
A psychopath and Diddley Dog is my teammate
And see we are closer than Fred and Barney Rubble
So step to BadNFluenz and you know you in double trouble
Motherfucker we the BadNFluenz clique
Some lunatics and we known to ruin shit
A terrorist I aint never been a role model
Nigga I grab the fucking 40 and down the whole bottle
And I dont even like fucking with no alcohol
But Ill snatch a joint and get smoked out for yall
Getting lit never having a fit
On the avenue having brew grabbing my dick
And if your clique talking shit its your clique Im a terrorize
The nine to your spine now your ass is paralyzed
Im dangerous and I aint even mad yet
I drop with couch and watch you bounce like a bad check
Cause Im a mack thats from 8900 bitch
Rappin Ron and Diddley Dog and BadNFluenz ruling shit
Fool dont understand all the shit that goes on up in this niggas head
From the hood come if you would but you might end up dead
See these sickass Oakland streets done turned me out
Surviving and making cash is what its about
Some people ask me why commit crimes to earn my scratch
But Im black and Im trapped and I cant turn back
I was raised as a cruel kid
Because the streets taught me more than these fakeass schools did
I tried the education system but I dropped it
So now Im in the goddamn game and cant stop it
And Im a motherfucking threat to authority
Make the police sweat when they check this wreckless minority
You want more of me well come to Oakland thats where I be at
Selling dope with my folks come close and see how we act
Hard niggas addicted to dirty money fast cars and fine hoes
On the drink every day like winos
And sometimes I be slipping up off the blunt
So I packs a pump for the punks who wanna try for their stunt
Cause I would never tell a ho how I make my green
I cut my cream on the un so I cant be seen
And then I bump up on the block and knock after knock
Watch the cop jock as I create a be a hot spot
Pushing slugs just to make it
Im in the game and its real and a nigga cant fake it
I know its sad what Im doing
But I dont give a fuck Im Ant Diddley Dog and Im a BadNFluenz
Nigga you think you got the shit in
You gotta get in where you fit in bitch
Motherfucker you outta pocket punkass bitch
Swollass motherfucker you cant fuck with the crew nigga
You need to get in where you fit in
You stupidass bitch
