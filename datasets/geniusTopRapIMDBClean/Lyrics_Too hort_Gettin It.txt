Thats right album number ten Short Dawgs in the house
Its gettin close to the end yall
But we gonna kick it like this on the last album
Now let me holler at ya partner spit this game
In your ear for a minute quit complainin
Bout how you cant spend it cause you aint got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message no its not a test its
Just me ridin legit they cant arrest me or bust me
Im still hungry I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours and buy my new album
Peep the game and dont be like Calvin
Get everything you want get real get your mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin it everything you want
Everything you dreamed of never have to front
You should be gettin it gettin money
Im talking bout you black dont laugh it aint funny
You should get a good lawyer like Johnnie Cochran
Swear to tell the truth Hell nah I didnt pop him
Get your kids in school so they can get an education
Get a degree and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin real good taking care of my folks
Roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short Dogs in the House I know you aint trippin
Cause Life is Too hort you gotta Get In Where You Fit In
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It aint what you think you got to read between the lines
Cause life aint long for a young black man
Tryin to make money doing all he can
Sellin dope dont ya hope he would go to class
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
With the twenties on top and the fifties on bottom
A flock a top notches oh yes we got em
Its been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin these funky sounds
Get your money mayne
Get yours
You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good get it while you can
You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good
Get your money mayne
Get yours
You should be gettin it
I know you tired of bein broke just hangin out
You gotta lot a dreams but you cant get out
The first thing you need to do is set yourself some goals
Think positive everything else is old
And work hard never stop hustlin
Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin
So what are you sayin Todd 
Its time to come up put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
Cause Im one in a million black men risin
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood I know its all good
And you should do the same I told you peep the game
From Too hort you know Im the man
I lend my brother a hand cause I know I can
I keep goin and goin but Im not the pink bunny
Instead of beatin on the drum I never stop thinking money
Im gettin all I can if you dont ya slip
I cant wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke I couldnt afford a meal
But now Im now rich I cant be fake I gots to keep it real
Its been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep makin these funky sounds
I earned my respect in the street
The ghettos been good to me
Im never going to turn my back
The true and living so I gots to kick the facts
