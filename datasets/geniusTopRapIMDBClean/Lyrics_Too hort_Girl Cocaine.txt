Girl  Cocaine  Lyrics
Girl Girl Girl
Thats your life
Girl
Smoking that glass pipe
I come from the city of dope
It couldnt be saved by John the Pope
Cause a basehead never sees the light
Two fat raps to the head last night
Cocaine Cocaine is that your rap
Every day and night its coming back
COCAINE
The rich mans high is what it used to be
But things looking different in 85
Cocaine cocaine is that your high
Since age thirteen what have I seen
A lotta baseheads straight coke fiends
Snorting puffing thats the life
But its all over when you hit that pipe
Big coke dealers on the knock
All smoked out with no more rocks
Baseheads buy coke from him
But he smokes more than all of them
The big coke man aint too cool
He smokes more than all you fools
Hes got a lotta dope but not a lotta bank
A brand new car with an empty tank
Pretty white smoke all in his chest
And a 84 Benz repossessed
Girl thats your life  Dont do it 
Girl smoking that glass pipe  Dont do it 
Fresh young tender only fifteen
Walking on a strip just wanna be seen
Never touched coke a day in her life
But now that girls gotta have her pipe
Cause she met a man his name was Jock
Do it to her a good and he smoked a rock
Put it in a joint all crunched up
And now every day she takes a puff
I know you know what coke can do
Come into your life and take over you
Now youre kicking back thinking bout your dream
But it never comes true cause youre just a coke fiend
You asked your woman Whats the prob
She said Its you cause you dont do your job
Used to make good love from the start
But now the coke did damage to your private parts


Your mind is gone your brain is blazed
Youve been wide awake for the last three days
Inhale exhale you dont care
Coke smoke only no fresh air
You cant even talk you dont wanna listen
You and your buddy on a cocaine mission
Three days straight wheres your mind
Its gone out of town and your brain is fried
Just smoke and choke until youre broke
Just smoke that coke until you croak
And it would be I cant lie
No good loss if you should die
Cause your life is wrecked your girl was checked
She chose on me and I was set
I took her home to make my move
But she wanted to base shes just like you
You saved your money for a yearandahalf
Youre so damn stupid you make me laugh
Bought a car cosigned by Daddy
A 1980 Fleetwood Caddy
You drove that car every place
Until that day when you first based
Look at it now the real big wheeler
Sold that Caddy to a big coke dealer
When you base coke until youre broke
Where I come from we call you smoked
SMOKED
To smoke more coke is all you need
You say coke is it its all that counts
Its got more ounce to the bounce
It put your life in a state of shock
Got you singing to yourself Im the king of rock
Rocks made you and now you simp
Seven hookers and one down pimp
If you never based in the first place
Theres no way you could pimp today
Cause it got you sprung and you said Look
I gotta have money cause I am hooked
None of your girls would ever quit
Cause you used game to get a hit
Youre the best basehead to ever live
You always take and you never give
You got your girls hooked too
And that is why right now youre through
They took your house car and gold
And you got life with no parole
Smooth locked down without a doubt
You killed two hookers when they smoked you out
You say dont knock it until you try it
It cost too much Ill never buy it
So I wont try it and you should knock it
You always have coke in your pocket
Wherever you go in this world
Its not just you its you and that girl
You love Snow White shes your life
Smoking that coke in a glass pipe
You needed some money and your girl came through
Now youre gonna smoke for a hour or two
But thats not you thats what you thought
Fake base rocks is what you bought
From some young brother on some street
One sick basehead just got beat
Got his rocks and rushed them home
Put it on the pipe and they just phoned
One sick basehead lost all hope
Thought he bought coke and just bought soap
Got his gun and who got shot
Some young punk at the base rock spot
Standing out there all alone
One basehead his mind was gone
He had to shoot cause someone got
One basehead with a fake base rock
Its the COCAINE
The rich mans high is what it used to be
But things looking different in 85
Cocaine cocaine the whole worlds high
Wherever I go in any town you know cocaine is all around
Right now today in 85
You better stop smoking while youre still alive
Girl thats your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe
Thats your life
Smoke that glass pipe
Thats your life
Just smoke that glass pipe
Girl
