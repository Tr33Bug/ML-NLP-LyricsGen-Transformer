I was told not long ago
Too hort dont stop that rap
Now every time I grab the mic
I rock it just like that
8 years ago when I started my rap
I used to sell tapes everywhere
It was me and my homeboy Freddy B yall
Kickin it like big players
Everybody loved my raps like hundred dollar bills
I rocked house parties on 98th
Even rocked in the 69 ville
Might find me on the mic at Hot Lips house
Or at the East Bay Dragons Spot
All the 85 boys with their hands in the air
Screaming Too hort just dont stop
Like Arroyo Park like Plymouth Rock
Birch Street and Sunnyside
Like Sobrante Park and Brookfield
East Oakland yeah thats right
5 years ago I continued to rock
And if you havent yet heard my name
It was all in the papers on the evening news
I was stone cold in the game
Around that time a friend of mine my homeboy Lionel B
Hooked me up like this yall on the stage just rockin the beat
Some say I have a dirty mind
Sometimes that might be true
But these are just some dirty times
I aint trippin on you
I aint trippin keep on talkin
You think Im smokin that pipe
I got money homeboy
I even got some of your future wifes
Well my story goes like this man
I smooth went out on wax
Singin Girl Thats Your Life
Female Funk and Shortrapp
Silky D worked the beat kicked me down cold cash
I was ridin the bus one day
Next day I was on the gas
Everybody loved Too hort
Rollin down the strip
Then one day just like that
Homeboy jumped on my tip
You started spreadin rumors man
And said you saw me rappin in jail
No I never came down to the flat lands
I was chillin with the homies on the hill
I aint trippin but the word went out
Sir Too hort was through
Cant really say where it all began
So Im blamin it all on you
Everybody used to say Too hort dont stop that rap
Now every time you see my face
You say Im smokin crack
Oakland California I heard it all before
Im makin big bank now rockin the crowd
I aint trippin no more

Now Im back on top again
I still dont stop that rap
Every time I grab the mic
My bankrolls gettin fat
Freaky Tales took care of that
You know Im comin up
Cause every time you see my face
Im rollin oh so tough
When I made the cutthethethe Freaky Tales
I started picturin this
I named my album Born To Mack
With the cleanest drop Biarritz
Everything was kickin in
Me and Ran kept cashin checks
Next thing I know there you go
Guess whos on my tip
You said I just got out of jail
Jumped right back on that pipe
Your sisters boyfriend told you man
Im smokin every night
Then you came to my show
And stood there so damn bold
You said Too hort man you smoking
And Im standin there draped in gold
I aint trippin no more
Really aint worth my time
So to squash it all I kicked on back
And wrote you all a rhyme
Benzes roll Beamers jet
And Caddies keep on dippin
You keep on talkin all that crap
I aint trippin
