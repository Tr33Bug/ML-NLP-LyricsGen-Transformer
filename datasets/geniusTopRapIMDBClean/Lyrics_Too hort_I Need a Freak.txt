In these times
Of hate and pain
We need a remedy
To take us from the rain
Jealousy
A little greed
Ive been thinking
Of what I need
I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak I really do
I want a freak one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak exclusively
So that she only comes and satisfies me
I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak every day and every night  Help me out 
I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak with long long hair
A super freak in underwear
I need a freak hear what I say
I need a freak to get me through the day
I need a freak so I can swerve
I need a super freak to calm my nerves
Now every day is the same I go get me a freak
Take her to my house til we hit the sheets
Got a saltwater fish tank built in the wall
Phat Jacuzzi tub sitting in marble
Freaks cant resist the way its laid
I spit the game and I got paid
Say Short what you doing with all that stack
Bitch seen all four walls had plaques
She go on and drop them draws
Dont take too long she cant stop the law
Street player Short Dogg baby is a
Kyptonite smoked out crazy nigga
I slip some crip on the freak  bitch 
She started licking on my feet
Up to my ears back down to here
I need a freak every day and thats real

I need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak every day and every night
Man they aint hearin what Im sayin man
They say the freaks come out at night
You on my mind you outta sight
If I dont see ya tonight it aint on
Ill take my other little young bitch home
Niggas like me know just what to do
Me and homie want to fuck with you and your girl
Teach you about the new world
Spit the game like old school perms and curls
Get naked and do thang that girl
Keep it right there I got one in the chamber
I aim it at your face and then squeeze the trigga
Can you hang with a freaky ass nigga
She took it all had a ball
She got nothing but a party yall
So all you squares and player haters dont sleep
I need a freak
I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak with long long hair
A super freak in underwear
I need a freak I really do
I want a freak one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak hear what I say
I need a freak to get me through the day
Short Doggs in the house
Yeah thats right
Players will be players baby
All dogs must chase the cat
Famous words
We going to get off into this Xrated shit
Ant Banks can I flip the script
If you break the beat down Im going to come back watch
So break it down watch
Were going to break it down old school style
This is the old school type right
Short Doggs in the house representing East Oakland West Coast
