And we sure do like to play
Im a player and Im playing just to play
You see I made up my mind when I was 17
I aint with no marriage and a wedding ring
Ill be a player for life so wheres my wife
Probably at the rehab stuck on the pipe
Cause she must be smoking and Im not joking
Too Short baby comin straight from Oakland
Got way mo bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
Cause I can give you a bitch and wouldnt give you joint
Bitches aint shit and now I made my point
So you can light that weed while I spit this rap
And tell you bout a player from way back
I was only fourteen when I first got my dick sucked
Now Im grown up and I really like to bust nuts
Gettin freaky in the right situations
You wanna rap well thats a nice occupation
To get pussy when you want and how you want it fool
Cause I was fucking ugly hoes back in high school
I used to fuck youngass hoes
Used to be broke and didnt have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tell a story bout rags to riches
Bout a pimp named Shorty from the Oakland set
Been mackin for years and aint fell off yet
So if you ever see me rollin in my drop top Caddy
Throw a peace sign and say Hey pimp daddy
Cause I never would front on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
Bitches come a dime a dozen
So dont get mad when I fuck your cousin
Your two sisters I even fuck your exbitch
Short Dog in the house with some player shit
All the fake players peep game from the real
Player hatin lover tell me how do ya feel
When you front to the homies how you grind em
Look fo a tramp but you cant find em
You got one girlfriend and see her every night
Come around her partners lyin about your life
Looked at your watch it said 622
Cut to the house and said Baby I love you
Cant act like a mack like playboy Sho
And the rest of the macks in the streets of the O bitch
Comin up we learned how to break these hoes
And when youre through gettin yours then you shake these hoes
And when youre older its nothin but a routine
Makin Gs every day workin blue jeans
I know I seen it before I see it again
Young tender saying Short would you be my man
Yeeeah theres a lot of fake players out there
Talkin bad about Ant Banks you know what Im sayin
But I aint trippin tho
Short Dog what you do about them player haters


Tryna stay away from Kris Kross imitators
Put ya in a cross cause theyre really just haters
I thought you knew Short Dog is a player
Born to mack and got bitches everywhere
I ride around town in my cleanass cars
Screenin these hoes like movie stars
Checkin my traps like a dirty rat
I was born to mack Im hookin hoes like crack
I be a monkey on your back bitch
Until you kick that Short Dog habit got you all on my dick
And even though I cant fuck you every day
Thats cause I got another bitch around the way
We can all get together on a late night
Cut to the house hook somethin up real tight
I really dont care
Cause Im a player
