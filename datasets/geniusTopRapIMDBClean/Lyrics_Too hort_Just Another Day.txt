I woke up one day in Vacaville
Round the corner from the pen phat house on the hill
All the homies in the pen straight locked down
But I gotta get dressed and hit the Oaktown
I called Randy Austin on the telephone
Early in the morning but he still aint home
So I called Ant Banks to see whats up
He said meet me at the studio at two oclock
I got dressed smoking on some serious dank
Grabbed my keys off the table and a big old bank
I hit Interstate 80 and Im rolling
Joints still burning and Im smoking
I was on my way to San Jose
To the stereo shop that make my music play
Cause one amp shut down and the bass aint playing
Didnt take long for Joel and Janks to have me slumping
So I called up BooWhats up nigga what you bout to do

Rolled on out like a playa
Hot ass day bitches everywhere
