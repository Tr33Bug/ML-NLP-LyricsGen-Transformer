Life Is Too Short Lyrics
I remember how it all began
I used to sing dirty raps to my Eastside fans
Back then I knew you couldnt stop this rap
No MC could rock like that
Then the new style came the bass got deeper
You gave up the mic and bought you a beeper
Do you wanna rap or sell coke
Brothers like you aint never broke
People wanna say its just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mic and Im not jokin
Sir Too Short comin straight from Oakland
California home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk beatin down the block
Short Dog Im that rappin man
I said it before and I ll say it again
Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short
Life is to some people unbearable
Committing suicide and thats terrible
Was it much too much or nothing big
If you live my life youd be fightin to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
Im tryin to get rich as I rock the place
Everybodys got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz keep your bank right here
Never hear me stutter once cause I talk real clear
Its on you homeboy whatcha gonna do
You can take my advice and start workin fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day homeboy ya soon find out
Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short


Life is too short would you agree
While Im living my life dont mess with me
Its been a long time baby since I first got down
But I still keep makin these funky sounds
Cause I dont stop rappin thats my theme
I make a lot of money do you know what I mean
Life is complicated you must stay up
Youre asked a simple question boy dont say What
Ya only live once and ya callin it hell
Policeman tryin to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you dont know
In a matter of time Ill be runnin the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin big money slangin hop
The task force tryin to peel your cap
Turn around homeboy you better watch your back
Life is too short
Life is
You can take back all the things you give
But you cant take back the days you live
Life is to some people heaven on earth
Livin every single day for what its worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfying one person I know thats me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when Im on the mic
Cause if a dream is all you got homeboy
You gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
No time to waste just get on that case
Cant be down cause you need to taste
A good life livin like a king on a throne
Getting everything you want and trying to handle your own
Its your life dont be stupid though
Cause when you waste it youll know life is
Life is
Alright thats it
