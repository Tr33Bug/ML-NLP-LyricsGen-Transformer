In the ghetto you think life is hard
Food stamps and to up cars
Wall to wall dirty orange carpet
Sittin in a bucket hopin you can start it
And ride around to the liquor store
Cant get a job get drunk some more
You betta stop trippin on dem stereotypes
Cause in the ghetto theres a good life
We aint starvin like Marvin wont see no roach
When ya chill wit the rich folks in the hood
Youre sittin on leather watchin big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Savin money and workin hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
Ya only got one life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face but dont know his name
You know he got the sack mayn
And hes sittin on a fat bank
Seven cars at his house in the driveway
Benz so clean dont roll it just fly away
Cause folks got money in the ghetto yeah you know
Hey hey hey whatcha got to say  Theres money in the ghetto 
Hollywoooooood Havin money in the ghettooo
Money in the ghetto aint nothin new
Its been like that way before you
Was even born get up from the down stroke
Chocolate City for the black folks
Say it loud in ya hot pants
Man child in the promised land
I take you back to Iceberg Slim
And all the players that came before him
If you a everyday hustler get your money
Cause what they do to black man aint funny
All the time tryin to put us the pen
You get paroled and then they send you again
All the homies in the hood gettin paid
You might have left but the money stayed
In the ghetto it aint all about drugs
Gettin paid doin all kinds of stuff
Only rule on the streets is dont get caught
Unless your hustle aint breakin the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We sittin on em fat in the hood
Im ridin on some gold ones
Smokin dank and its potent
Ask them fools cause they know
Theres money in the ghetto
Chorus One
I got money baby just tell me the price
Cause Short Dawg aint nuttin nice
I always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin
Spend fo get an ounce of dank then
Rich nigga get high relaxin
If I bust a Ben Frank get some Andrew Jacksons
Five twenties for a hundred dollar bill
You know the math lets make a deal
On the one dollar bill if you look on the front
You find the face of George Washington
Make money baby thats all I do
Thats how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the two
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the five
And Hamilton my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the ten
These are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The American dream for the average minority
Make your money get some weed and a forty
Im on the Eastside livin like a king
Kick back watchin fiftyinch screens
Bounce to the Westside hit the studio
And spend my money in the ghetto
Hey hey hey whatcha got to say  They got money in the ghetto 
Hollywoooooood Havin money in the ghettooo
Nowadays if you cant say a rap or play sports
You might just come up short
And they always say the same things
Dont be a gangster or a dopefiend
Get your high school diploma go to college
Get a degree and start makin dollars
Only one thing wrong and its a Trip
Inner city schools dont teach us shit
Got us stuck on stupid Straight SOS
Cant get nothin but they payin the rest
Of them fools
All Around the world in the other countries
They should be spendin that money right here
In the state of California
You graduate and cant spell diploma
Dip to the hood and get rich
Slangin rocks to a smokedout bitch
No schoolll come close to that
A few transaction make my pockets fat
I make a lot of money and it aint no lie
Ill probably ball til the day I die
And if I didnt so what
I bet you Id still come up
Cause theres a whole lot of money in the ghetto yeah you know
Chorus Two
