Oakland
Oakland
Oakland California
Oakland california is the city of snakes
Pimps pussies players and fakes
Loud mouth bitches who talk too much
Dick teasin bitches who never fuck
Sucka ass nigga fake as hell
A man or a bitch I really cant tell
Some of you niggas need to quit
Show and tell nigga you aint shit
Sayin I got this and I got that
But when it comes to you I got no rap
Cause what I see is good for me
And what I dont know just let it be
Bitches gamin workin extensions
Her hair aint really but two inches
Bald head girls in the Oakland world
Short afros and jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald head and say go to hell
But your a snake your a worm
Bald head bitch you need a perm
Oakland california is the city of liars
Fresh barbed wires with vouge tires
Niggas tellin stories twenty minutes long
And everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I dont wanna know
All I want is stereo rock
Homeboys kick it gettin keyed
Sold that mark some fake weed
Told that nigga here you go
A big fat sack and you know its premo
A 20dollar bill went to your hand
You rushed that money to the coke man
To the coke bottle was the next stop
But you broke the bottle and cant smoke rock
Base rocks base rocks thats your daddy
You better off smokin on a powdered cabby
Have a white christmas everyday
Cause cocaine cabby is a too short way
Thats Too SHORT
Smoke more coke than Richard P
Have more money than Michael Jackson
Oakland can I get some action
Hey young tender in the 501s
I love to see when you work your tongue
Suckin my dick in the back of the car
Rollin down Skyline boulavard
I said beeeeeeeyach
What are you smoking
A big fat dick in the big East Oakland
I see my homie he needs to quit
Holdin hands with a bitch who looks like shit
Maybe Im wrong by what I say
Maybe that nigga is gettin paid
Maybe that nigga aint bein used
Gettin fucked without collectin dues
Thats how I work all the time
Im Too Short baby got a fresh new rhyme
For Oakland California thats the place
Homies got drugs all in yo face
When the OPD cruise down again
Niggas goin half off dubes and tens
On any corner anywhere
Buy your drugs from a Oakland player
Niggas sell squat callin it top
Cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
Crime went down murder went up
And some of these turfs are tryin to get tuff
Whos the leader of the hour
Anybody livin if they push power
M16 357
Sendin these niggas to hell not heaven
So much death in the Oakland streets
Your nothin but a target sellin weed
You know Im rappin the honest truth
Niggas roll up shootin guns at you
Threatening your life and calling you fake
Till you take your drugs to another state
And sometimes man its a pity
Cause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city
Niggas who take do you know yourself
You must be the nigga with all the wealth
Maybe one day you can own this town
If everybody fucked and you are down
Thats how you see it I do too
But I break bitches and you break crews
Oakland California is gettin tough
Niggas got schemes for coming up
Niggas got ways to make big bank
Hittin these streets like an army tank
Im Too SHORT
Spitin more game than youll ever speak
music for 10 seconds 
I got more bitches wantin me
Cause Im the best dam rapper from the Oakland streets
Im the coldest MC on a microphone
Oakland California wont leave it alone
Cause Im on this mic rapping that game
Knockin off tapes like Im selling cocaine
Fucking these freaks indefinitely
I never stop fucking you Oakland freaks
High school bitches really like
The way Sir Too Short can rock the mic
Oakland California thats the place
Freak freak bitch got a lot of ways
She got big fat titties size 38
Imma fuck that bitch but I cant wait
The young girl makes my body boil
When I fuck that bitch imma drill for oil
Imma put cocaine all over my dick
And tell that bitch its time to lick
East Oakland thats where I live
The city of the freak freak freaky bitch
I spent the night with her she aint mine
I fuck that bitch so many times
And that right there I could never fake
I thought my goddamn dick would break
Fucking too much makes you hurt
But I never stuck a bitch from puttin in work
All you bitches can suck me dry
Suckin my dick for the rest of your lives
Ok baby here we are
Were just two young freaks in the back of the car
You are one whos the other
Its Sir Too Short that rappin ass brotha
Everytime I talk to you
Whatcha wanna know is it still cool
And everytime what do I state
Your still my bitch thats everyday
All you bitches cause Im a hall
And you baby girl my freaky doll
Im too short baby now Im smokin
Another big cabby and Im in East Oakland
Not the west not the north
Its the eastside baby Im Sir Too Short
I can spit a rap and ill create
A sucker MC everyday
Niggas from Oakland young and old
Runnin round here keep off that dope
Singin my rap at the skating rink
Sucker MC do you know what I think
You wanna be me so damn bad
You wish that you could make my raps
When I say Short you say your name
Tellin your homies you rappin game
But I sell tapes and niggas know
You singin my rap in stereo
Some of you niggas aint really shit
And Tony G is just a bitch
Why does Tony rap like me
Cause he aint no pass high 
Just sleep to the world on what I do
Grab a mic front you
Tony G you just cant have it
Nothin but a little lightskinned old faggot
Tryin to rap on the mic
But Too Short baby is what they like
