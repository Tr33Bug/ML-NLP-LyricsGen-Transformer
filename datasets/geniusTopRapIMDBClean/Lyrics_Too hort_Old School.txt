Old school Im from the old school
Old school Im from the old school
I came in the door as the story goes
Looked around the room all I seen was hoes
Its like a pussy supermarket lets go shoppin
Packed like sardines clubs straight poppin
Fuck the VIP section
Im bout to hit the pharmacy and get my head connected
Get me some protection
Walk around and see who I wanna have sex with
The usual  a nice highyellow cutie
Or maybe tonight I might find a black beauty
With a big ol booty no doubt
Well have a few drinks and then roll out
I cant do the Jungle Fever
Cause its too many black hoes here that might see ya
If I peep a white broad with some ass and lips
Fine as hell  Imma have to ask the bitch somein
Cause I might end up fuckin
I dont care what you say I dont owe you hoes nothin
I fuck tall bitches even fuck small bitches
Too bad I cant fuck all you bitches
It dont take players like me too long
To get bitches like you to let me take you home
I got the game from Oakland California
Im Short Dawg I hope your momma warned ya
Bout the old school do the old school
Im from the old school do the old school
Im always hustlin always workin hard
If you tryin to get the money Imma do my part
On the weekends we like to celebrate
Cash checks ride away cant wait
Fuck crime  Im bustin Too hort rhymes
Unless its bout millions I aint tryin to do time
Its like everyday is Saturday
So many bitches let me have my way
You can analyze it all you want
But I was knockin bad hoes with no teeth in the front
When I had no money and drove my mommas car
I had badass bitches look like superstars
Its the game old as it may be
It makes fineass hoes call me baby
I look down and think this that fuckin shit
Seein this beautiful bitch she just suckin my dick
Too many times in a players wife
We always have to hear what you squares feel like
Fuck that do what you gotta do
I see you creepin through the hood buyin prostitutes
I know Im fuckin hoes and gettin high
You wanna criticize me but you livin a lie
With yo suit and tie and yo love for hoes
You aint shit motherfucker and Short Dawg knows
Im from the old school do the old school
Do the old school Im from the old school
Dont cross the game theyll take yo life
Respect the game and you can play all night
If you snitchin dont get caught slippin
If you bloodn or cripn other niggas settrippin
Watch yo back it dont take a brainiac
We got a lot of homocidal maniacs in the streets
Sometimes life is terrible
Yall say goodbye niggas say be careful
Back in the day they woulda killed yo ass
For a reason they might even keep you breathin
Fuck your whole world up you cant get down
Broke livin on the streets and you cant skip town
But aint no slow deaths in the tripleoh
If you fuckin up then you get to go
Somebody gon hold you down
So you cant get up off that cold ground
Lights flashin and you keep passin out
You know you fucked up with your badass mouth
Once upon a time they woulda knocked you out
Maybe back in ninetynine but not in 2000
Anybody wanna do it like the old school
Hella niggas at the park with no shootin
Sunday afternoon at the park
Niggas leanin hella hard goin by in the car
Do the old school do the old school
Im from the old school do the old school
Old school do the old school
Im from the old school
Yeah old school baby BEOTCH
