Pretty Tony That nigga wanted the honey all we wants is the money
Yknow all bitches are the same just like my hoes I keep em broke Wake up one morning with some money they subject to go crazy yknow
Im going to tell you a story in stereo
About the pimping game that you should know
But if you dont its alright
Cause Ill be spittin this game to you all damn night
When I was 3 years old
Straight pimp game I was told
My daddy sent me to a pimp school
In this mans world you cant be no fool
If a pimp is what you wanna be
Youre gonna have to learn pimpology
Pimpology a pimps profession
Cant be affected by the Great Depression
So if you want to be giant sized
Come to my school Get pimpmotized
In your school what do they teach
English math and history
Pimpin game you can learn
And if you do you will earn
A pimp diploma just for you
For learning what youre taught when you come to school
Lesson 1 you should know
Never love a bitch or a ho
Lesson 2 tells you to do only one thing
Act cool
Lesson 3
Breaking a bitch If shes poor if shes rich
If your game is soft or hard
It shouldnt take long to break the broad
Lesson 4
Keep your ho Its the most important thing to know
Cause I pimp or die bitch Im like the Mack
Riding around Oakland in a Cadillac
But on the other hand if you just cant pimp
And the hoes keep treating you like a simp
I dont know what to say about you boys
You better go to the store and buy some toys
Cause you cant play this game

Sending young tenders on a wild goose chase
Up in the hills trying to find my place
Getting lost getting tossed getting found and clowned
Every time you see Short baby you get down
