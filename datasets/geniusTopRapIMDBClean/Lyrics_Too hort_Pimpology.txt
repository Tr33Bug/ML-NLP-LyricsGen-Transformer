Im going to tell you a story in stereo
About the pimping game that you should know
But if you dont its alright
Cause Ill be spittin this game to you all damn night
When I was 3 years old
Straight pimp game I was told
My daddy sent me to a pimp school
In this mans world you cant be no fool
If a pimp is what you wanna be
Youre gonna have to learn pimpology
Pimpology a pimps profession
Cant be affected by the Great Depression
So if you want to be giant sized
Come to my school Get pimpmotized
In your school what do they teach
English math and history
Pimpin game you can learn
And if you do you will earn
A pimp diploma just for you
For learning what youre taught when you come to school
Lesson 1 you should know
Never love a bitch or a ho
Lesson 2 tells you to do only one thing
Act cool
Lesson 3
Breaking a bitch If shes poor if shes rich
If your game is soft or hard
It shouldnt take long to break the broad
Lesson 4
Keep your ho Its the most important thing to know
Cause I pimp or die bitch Im like the Mack
Riding around Oakland in a Cadillac
But on the other hand if you just cant pimp
And the hoes keep treating you like a simp
I dont know what to say about you boys
You better go to the store and buy some toys
Cause you cant play this game
Pretty Tony Next time you hear grown folks talking shut the fuck up yhear
Now you heard my story in stereo
About the pimpin game that you should know
But if you dont its alright
Cause Ill be spittin this shit to ya all damn night

My last album sold a million copies
Me and the maestro laying the beat
DJ scratches from my homeboy Pee

A new LP every year
You know we rolling cant be faking
We come through and all your girls were taking
You know were rolling Dont do no simpin
Oaktown players strictly pimpin
Bitch my name is Short Just what youve been looking for
Sending young tenders on a wild goose chase
Up in the hills trying to find my place
Getting lost getting tossed getting found and clowned
Every time you see Short baby you get down
Cause the raps I make are the raps you like
The way Sir Too Short rocks the mic
Its a one of a kind rapping style
Have the freaks in the crowd going wild
For when I spit my rhyme whats my tip
