Rap like me youll go straight to the top
Keep doing what youre doing and youre sure to get dropped
Like a trick nothings even up my sleeve
A million albums sold and its hard to believe
Well its true homeboy its not a lie
I used to sell tapes on Sunnyside
I used to catch the 40 bus around the way
Me and Fred Benz slanging tapes
All these things that we did
Grab the microphone and start screaming Bitch
You fronting MC I hate to cap
You make hit records and you still cant rap
I said it before Ill say it again
You dont believe me ask your fans
When I walked into Cali the place was packed
Sir Too hort Dont stop that rap
I keep rapping my rhymes all the time
You got no rhymes so you listen to mine
Im not starting a fight just telling it right
The best damn rapper who ever grabbed the mic
His name is Too hort now shut your mouth
In 81 I was rocking the house
Im a hustler baby coming up
I hustle every day and I dont sell drugs
I dont run no gangs dont shoot no dice
Gave the same damn speech to the Oakland vice
But if you keep pushing just like you
When they see me on the strip coming through
I break it down so vicious itll break your back
With the beat so loud playing Too hort raps
Thats it Im set
No need to talk that bullshit
I need a Oaktown big time sound
Just enough beat to get on down
So you other rappers listen to mine
You wouldnt catch Short Dog rapping nursery rhymes
Call my rap trash jam the junk
Put a sticker on the cover XRated Funk
Its just me you say I wont go far
But I wont stop rapping cause I rap so hard
From here to New York back to California
I bumped your girlfriend dont say I didnt warn ya
All this time you said shes your ho
You really shouldnt give baby all that dough
She gave it all to me cause I fuck so good
I practice on the girls in my neighborhood
Cause when Im freaky I rap I spit a rap to a freak
I rarely ever think about a sucker MC
I go platinum its just like slapping em bitch
Short Dog in the house starting some shit
MCs rock and MCs roll
But the albums they make never go gold
When I was young I knew Id be one of the best
Every time I made a song it came out so fresh
I was the king of the Oaktown spitting my game
10 years later aint nothing changed
Still the Boss of the Bay and I know what they say
They call me Godfather and they call you Gay
Bitch Its 1990
Your girlfriends out there trying to find me
She heard about me I fucked her best friend
I guess she wants to see if I can do it again
You want to be like me so damn bad
The impossible dream all you MCs had
If you could rap like me you wouldnt have the dream
Start rapping quit flapping like a chicken wing
If could rap like me they say youre so great
But when they talk about you they say youre so fake
And as the days go by you cant forget
The way I make you feel like shit
MCs like you Ive seen em before
You keep on saying Fuck Too hort
But Im a better MC than you
And aint a damn thing you can do but bitch
On the TV screen in the magazines
When they interview you you just make up things
Youre on an ego trip and youre fronting like youre down
Youre not the first real rapper from the Oakland town
Youre just a new jack and you cant even rap
You wanna trip Trip on that
Im like MC Lyte checking hoes tonight
If youre not a real rapper get off the mic
Cause with a fake MC a songs never complete
Youd better learn to rap like me
Thought you want to be like Too hort
Thought you want to be like Too hort
Whenever I rap you call it noise
Im tearing up shit up like the Acorn Boys
On 10th street I got a big freak
Until you learn to speak realize youre weak
Cause its the Oaktown and they all get down
To the rhythm of the Too hort funky sound
It goes boom baselines on ya
Dangerous Crew from Oakland California
Bitch dont front cause Short Dog is hard
If you answer my rap I tear your ass apart
Just like this it lasts forever
You make a song and I make one better
You say I cuss I say youre fake
Your eyes pop open like paper plates
You fronting MC I hate to cap
I make hit records with the vicious raps
I said it before Ill say it again
The boy aint nothing but one of my fans
Like silicon titties can you feel em
How can a fake rapper fuck with a real one
Shit Im that rapping man
I like you like the Klu Klux Klan
Motherfucker want to front on me
My posse got a real MC Too hort
And it dont stop and it dont stop and it wont stop
Cause Im Too hort baby on the microphone
And Im macking bitch
Thought you want to be like Too hort
Thought you want to be like Too hort
Thought you want to be like Too hort
Thought you want to be like Too hort
Now back to the subject my boy MC
Whatever you say you cant rap like me
Rappers like me make real hits
Rappers like you talk bullshit
I told my boys theres a new Funky Drummer in town
Youre trying to be like James Brown
If I couldnt be me who would I be
I damn sure wouldnt be a sucker MC
Cause Im not like you my game is true
I pimped these hoes and I pimped you too
Cause Im boss and boss makes the rules
You disobey and you be a fool  Now listen 
One remember how it all began
Dont guess the answer is Oakland
Two youd better learn to rap like me
Or you like to be a fake MC
Three never talk down on a player
I wouldnt care if you was Fred Astaire
Last but not least number four
Dont ever fuck with Too hort bitch
Thought you want to be like Too hort
Thought you want to be like Too hort
