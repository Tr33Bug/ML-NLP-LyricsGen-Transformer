Without a doubt Im coming back and if you dont know
Call me SIR T double O
I like to say these rhymes I do it all the time
I make my own damn beat now all the money is mine
I carry big fat wads I treat my girls like gods
Ask em who do they love and they all say Todd
Im just an MC rapper and nothin else
I keep rhymin and I do it by myself
Could you be like me I rap my nonstop rhymes
You will never hear pause when I say these lines
I go on and on Im sir Too Short
Just what youve been lookin for
Like PCP or cooked cocaine
DJ universe got you sprung in the game
We make money hear my rap from coast to coast
From host to host I hear that toast
Too Short love the way you make that hit
Heres to you keep rhymin and boy dont quit
I say this is how it goes when I say my rap
Most times when I rhyme wouldnt be like that
Cause the way I write rhymes you will comprehend
I keep rappin to the very end
And if you call me fake Ill say so what
Got you standin and noddin like you just shot up
So boy straightin up Im still rappin
Comin at you fresh Do you know what happened
Im sayin rhymes messin with your mind
I didnt want your girl cause she really aint fine
I took her to a motel couldnt have been the hotel
It costs me 20 dollars but I did it so well
She had to tell your sister your sister told you
Now the whole damn town calls me playboy too
I got rhymes keep em comin they dont stop
Im lookin at an empty page about to fill it up
I write only the truth speak only to you
So if I tell you to say somethin then you know what to do
I got rhymes keep em comin they never stop
I live in California drive a drop top
Roll by the beach look at the freaks
Jump in my car do it every week
DJs who know call me Mister Short
All you wanna be mothers get no child support
Im Too Short baby gettin rich
Get on the mic and then say Like left to right
Right to left girl stealin your heart is like petty theft
Like 10 to 9 3 to 2
Ill always be one up on you
Like nightfall makes the sun go down
CRAZY RACK laid the beat changed your life around
From the sea to the mountains the mountains to the sea
All youre gonna do is wanna rock this beat
Its so rough so tough when I talk this stuff
When I get on the mic I cant get enough
Im the rapper of the season fresh and recent
All my raps are smooth undecent
Im that rapper known place to place
For the hardest rap with the hardest bass
You see I rap all the time thats the point
When I walk in the place  just jam the joint
Singin old Too Shorts on the microphone
The beats so fresh cant leave me alone
You see I rap so cool I will not shout
I keep comin so hard I might knock you out
If youre battlin Short thats the chance you take
So you better come fresh and dont be fake
All you weak MCs with your weak drum beats
Tellin all your people you can hang with me
Count 1 to 10 count 10 to 20 and Ill just keep on makin money
Life is Too Short I dont stop
Im hooked on money like a junkie on top
I got to make it every day I wont go broke
Ask me am I rich and Ill say no
Im your homeboy Too Short back again
Puttin Oakland on the map my rap will never end
Id like to send a special thanks to the dangerous crew
For believin in me when they thought I was through
I got rhymes I keep em comin
Im on the mic I wont stop rappin till it comes out right
And when its beatin Ill just say lets roll
I make another record and buy some gold
I keep rhymin and I do it by myself
Im like a one man crew you see I dont need help
I get the job done so all you fake rappers MCs rap masters
Give it up leave that rappin to me
Realizin young buck you cant rock that beat
I rap on the mic and youll believe
Nothin aint kickin like the BIG OLD C
Its just one hard rapper spittin a rap
Not 3 or 4 suckas or a couple of saps
Like born to Mack Ill cash a check
Walkin round like a fool livin up to his rep
Ill tell you life aint long
What you waitin for
Thought you wanted to be like Too Short
