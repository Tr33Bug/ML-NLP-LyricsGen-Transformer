So you want to be a gangster all that shit
Smoke any motherfucker dont even trip
You be hard as hell take whatever you want
Punk suckers wanna front they get done
Cause you a gangsternothin more nothin less
Put my boy to the test and catch one in your chest
Since he was young homeboy wont back down
Cause real gangsters always hold that frown
Until you lose control then you sell your soul
To the devil motherfucker cause youre way too cold
And all the people hide and just run inside
Cause you keep usin yo gat committin homicide
Boy I tell ya life is way too short
Another brother just got smoked
And you killed himaint that a bitch

Gangsta gangsta 
Shoot em up  gangsters 
That aint cool  gangsters

Shoot em up  gangsters 
That aint cool  gangsters 
Let me tell you somethin youngster you got it all wrong
Gangsters dont live that long
I had gangster partners get they heads tore off
For some of that gangster shit caught in the cross
You want stripes take yo ass to the service
Cause when its on aint no time to get nervous
Pull the triggeryeah you did it
Yous a gangster and I got to admit it
But yous a youngbuck you aint learned yet
Killin dont make you a vet
Get out the fast line stick with the homeboys
Readymade gangster get gone boy
Cause where Im from its the same ol shit
You call them shots when youre down with the click
Niggas dyin everyday but thats a black thang
You either sell dope or you gangbang
But you got the biggest heart in the click man
You did a murder and now youre a hitman
All your homies tryin to tell you that aint cool
Playin shoot em up like a fuckin fool
But yous a gangster one they cant destroy
Dont even give a fuck about your boys
You go for self you wanna be on top
Fucked around and now your brothers shot
Gangsta

Aint that a bitch  gangsters 
Shoot em up  gangsters 
That aint cool  gangsters
