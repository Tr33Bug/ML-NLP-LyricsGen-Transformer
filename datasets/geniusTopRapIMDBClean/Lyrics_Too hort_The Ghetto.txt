Talking bout the ghetto
Funky funky ghetto
Trying to survive trying to stay alive
The ghetto
The ghetto
Talking bout the ghetto 
The ghetto
The ghetto
Funky funky ghetto 
Even though the streets are bumpy lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day its the same and its the same every night
I wouldnt shoot you bro but Id shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how Ill die
Only thing I know is how to survive
Theres only one rule in the real world
And thats to take care of you only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime dont pay
Black man trying to break into my house again
Thought he got off dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so Im giving it back to the ghetto
The ghetto
Talkin bout the ghetto 
The ghetto
Funky funky ghetto 
The ghetto
Trying to live our lives 
The ghetto
Wont ya tell em bout it Too hort 
So just peep the game and dont call it crap
Cause to me life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant aint nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby died just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house no food to eat
Dont look at me and dont ask me why
Mamas next door getting high
Even though shes got five mouths to feed
Shed rather spend her money on a HIT
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him Id better help myself
Housing Authority and the OPD
All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto
The ghetto
People are dyin 
The ghetto
Children are cryin 
The ghetto
Dont have enough to eat 
The ghetto
Dont even have shoes on their feet 
The ghetto
Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like TOO HORT
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and thats all they know
Didnt teach him in school now hes slangin dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies
In the ghetto you keep one eye open
All day long just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life youll be throwing up
Like me but you dont see
Ten years from now where will you be
The ghetto
Tryin to get out of the ghetto 
The ghetto
But I got no place to go 
The ghetto
Tryin to survive in the heart of the ghetto 
The ghetto
Ha cause thats the only place that I know 
So much game in a Too hort rap
Cant be white and whites cant be black
Why you wanna act like someone else
All you gotta do is just be yourself
Were all the same color underneath
Short Dog is in the house you better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black stand tall and hard
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent when you put em in check
Cause when youre ignorant you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you dont listen its not my fault
Ill be getting paid and youll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my people try to get out
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto 
Talkin bout the ghetto 
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto 
Funky funky ghetto 
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto 
Tryin to survive 
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto 
Tryin to stay alive 
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto 
Funky funky ghetto 
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto 
Got no place else to go 
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto 
Tryin to stay alive 
The ghetto  Talkin bout the ghetto
