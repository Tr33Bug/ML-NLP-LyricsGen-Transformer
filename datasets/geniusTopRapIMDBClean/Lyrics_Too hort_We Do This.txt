Hey check this out Short you know what Im saying
Yeah you down here in Oakland you know what Im saying
And Im all up in Michigan you know what Im talking about I need
To get up on my pimpin you know what Im talking bout I need to be
A player nowadays you know what Im saying Niggas need to know how
To play these hoes you know what Im saying On the strength why dont you put me up on that pimpin shit
I do it like the best of the greatest not the worst
Like welfare day cant stop the first of the month
Cant stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good ho niggas sure better keep her
Cause Im on the prowl all the time
Tryin knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I aint never ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Then pull out a bitch like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to
I might pass it
So get butt naked shake that ass bitch
Im bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts but Im gone do these things bitch
Like that Short Uhh cant take shorts just cause your name Short
Matter fact Ima quit taking shorts man
Spit a little game to em Breed 
Ahhh why have a nine when I can have a ten
If she aint Lickin up the nuts while Im gone holler at her friend
Bitch aint no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday ho that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin if she aint licking me up
Im givin her to Short cause he dont give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin my house
If you really dont want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Umm have you seen my bitch
I aint seen her but if I do she gets dick
Thats what Im givin her just like that
To the front and back nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely feelin she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost cause yellin pause when they drop the draws
Its entrapment have yo nigga breakin nigga laws
But it aint a matter of mentality its reality
Open your eyes realize bitches aint nothin but a causality
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin time
Shes just an every day dont wanna catch her fuckin mine
Bitch aint mine so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this


Short I know you aint done explaining you know what Im saying
Pimpin is an all American sport you know what Im saying A lotta
People and got that down pat yet but uh why dont you explain it out for em
You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin pool
But when you play the game of life aint no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
Cause if you dont nigga yours will be mine
And I wont go to bed early wont sleep too late
And Ill never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad
Just a player ass nigga and thats all I rap about
Bitches hoes and all that shit
She got my number if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin Im gone fuck the ho harder
Just havin fun with the bitch as she sprung on my dick
Guess Ill pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Years Day to New Years Eve
And every day in between I will do these things I dont stop bitch
Hahahaha that nigga Short uh uh yeah uh
I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12inch single
Yeah so what you bitches wanna do
Step to me you gots to do my crew first
When I rehearse I change rearrange
My mentality will bring you to reality
You on me like cologne til now
I feel its time for us to bone
So I look and pimp the background
Look listen put the bitch on lockdown
Yeah you hangin out with me tonight
Every things alright but a nigga wanna fight
Damn thats a real player hater for ya
Fuck it Ill be waitin for ya
Im droppin lines like a motherfuckin pimp at this shit
Im gettin hoes out they clothes cause Im good at this shit
They callin me the pussy jammer cause Im breakin hoes off
See Im paid to be boss Im kickin back at no cost
Never slackin just mackin money stackin thats my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle now Im drunk as a skunk
High off the dank but I cant front
See Im never being senile
See Im smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin it wild but in the meanwhile we the coolest
Sure enough this how we do this
Im fingerfuckin with my diamonds
Now peep a nigga climbin the charts
Aint no fear in my heart I represent it from the start
Indeed my momma raised me as a G from birth
I be a hustler mothafucka til I sees my hearse
No doubt I bust a shot for all my niggas in jail
All the young black males that gotta slang yayo
Cause its a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Aint no love unless a nigga slangin drugs and high
Conversation with these bitches on my mobile always in control and never let these bitches know you and even though
Im gettin high a thug nigga gettin by
Catchin bitches spittin lies Im gettin mine
Allday I puff a blunt and parlay
And sometimes if we party
Getting my dick licked twice and death to a tricks life
We can pursue this til my shits right
Went from havin fantasies to havin hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me
The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case
When them punk police tried to break me
Didnt think the shit was cute so I got a lawsuit
Made them punk police buy my Coupe
This is how we do this
