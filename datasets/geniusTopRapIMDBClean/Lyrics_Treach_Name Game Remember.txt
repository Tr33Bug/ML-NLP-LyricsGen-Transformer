Name Game  Remember  Lyrics
Ive been called many things for many reasons
Many men die in any season
I will be I will be
Verse and chapter forever after
In the midst of tears hear my laughter  Treach speaking Oh we back on that again huh 
I will be I will be  Treach speaking over the hook if they dont know you they dont know you 
I inspire a whole entire world
That lives like Sopranos and The Wire
Anthony  a mean player hold your head you stay up
Aint a dream slayer Im a team player
Remember that one
Get torn like wet tissue
Remember names is the issue
Remember whether names or initials
DGH OPP uh CGP GSG
Its in the end all we are
Till our RIP dont start me out
Gotta hold your brain man cause  is brain aid
Aint nothing changed its still a fucking name game
Theyll remember my name like a stripper knows a titty spot
Or like a gangster knows a city block
Whether Im poor like November theyll remember
Like Im a member ofyou know the name
Ive been called many things for many reasons
Many men die in any season
I will be remember remember
I will be remember remember
Verse and chapter forever after
In the midst of tears hear my laughter
I will be remember remember
I will be remember remember
I will be


Look at the gun name the trigger
Look at the lane name the nigga
Name the liquor from his last hiccup
Remember the rat like the jail you entered
Remember his name like the judge that sent ya
Remember the  remember the writers
Remember the voting    remember the ridersrioters
Dont give the shirt off your back leave them naked
Dont ask for respect nigga go and take it
Im repping team Jersey
Make them remember your name
Like you were wearing a team jersey
On the back of it
Dont fall back to shit
Ghetto activists
Want some bastardfaster shit
It still is the same
Real in the game
Feeling my main instead of feeling my pain
Im real in the game Im dealing with gain
They gon remember my name believe that
I used to be known for selling good dope
Suicides a good road for me nope
Now Im known for giving the hood hope
Cheated death to starve a face like a martyr
Here to give my final destination a harder departure
Bye negativity I be known for being better me
Known to leave a long legacy
Cause we dont know what the future gives
You gon remember my name
Like the feds know a fugitive
