CHORUS
Ive got a pocket full of miracles  physical miracle 
And with my pocket full of miracles  lyrical miracle 
But theres that pocket full of miracles  medical miracle 
And heres my pocket full of miracles  A pocket full of this a pocket full of that

VERSE 1
I got a pocket full of stuff chocolate full of nuts
When a damsels in distress I dont let her down I lift her up
Pick her up and place her on a snatch sniper
She open scoping I open lotion she opens wide
Cause I got that somethin thatll make a married momma wanna mingle
Act singl and feel a little extra tingle
Extra spcial triple X X marks the spot though
Ive got a pocket full of  X n hydro
I get the muscles popping had that ass flushin condoms
After that well hit the mall you know my hustles hoppin
Theres two mays to treat em better or leave em
Love em so much be ready to twoway a threesome
I got a pocket full of rockets and act right
Im rollin ready to finish where we left off last night
I do the cabin stabbin I dont bone no boogers
I got a pocket full of magnums go and grab em sugar
CHORUS
VERSE 2
Say hello to the cheeba hitter rehash for quitters
Wine is fine but fuckin liquor is quicker nigga
Slaughter the snitchin when I order the kitchen
Picture a whore at at quarter to 9 or quarter to 8 and you caught a conniption
Love to order hustle and grind and takin offers
Got no time for the well running dry and lookin for water
911 couldnt fade us Bush makes the world hate us
Next time they build towers better build them bitches bow legged
My technique aint techno its tech nine
Snitches Ill give you a Columbian necktie for next time
Hey ho ho hey bout to get the trip a trippin
If a ho tells me a  then smack the ho for snitchin
I done smacked too many CEOS and weary rhymers
Now these labels are fridget hard and scared to sign us
If you wasnt interested shouldnt have the meeting
Fuck snakes its gats if we aint signed by the weekend
CHORUS
VERSE 3
Im talkin about people in the ghetto that make you use the metal
Tryin to put the test on god keep your vest on
You know the name glad to meet ya if I aint stealin ya
You know the game glad to teach ya blow the ceiling through
Throw the flames have you see through thats what villians do
Call me novocaine and anesthesia cause I aint feeling you
We get played we get even leave the heathens grieving
My teams so mean they should have highlights on ESPN
Every mic I touch Ive sworn Ive torn it Ive put my balls on it
Jersey bullshit we on it
Jealousy and envy will get you nowhere
A bullet through your hairline leave you with no hair
Stuck like cactus full metal jacket
In the Guinness book for crooks for worlds fastest ass kicks
Oh he made it but he aint the gladdest
Cause hes a vegetable like greens peas and carrots
CHORUS
