Bring that beat back
VERSE 1
You arent touching or bossing nothing
So shut the fuckin fussin
Running tucking and ducking from the muthafuckin bucking
Blessed east to west the testing lesson in session
Powerful and deep like them Xmens and Mexicans
Proof everyday with my fools every fight
Learn something new every day fuck something new every night
Im scandalous paid it lucked up and fucked up
Might see me in some gators or some tough tims scuffed up
I got the vino she know you know the mean ingressio
On my way to Vegas past Reno with the casino lingo
Whipping ass its naughty one for realer yeah
My clique to an African he aint believe we had guerillas here
In guerilla wear we bought to stomp 
Your bitch before I hit it she was backed up like a cross Bronx
Picture the route of this without getting rude and shit
Dont check me check your bitch cause she was actin real hooterish
CHORUS
Stop
Stop look and listen
Stop drop pop it
Stop the bumbaclot bitchin
Stop near the target
Stop actin stanky
Stop or Ill start it
Get down you can do it
Get down you can do it get
Bring that beat back
Dont stop pop it shorty
Dont stop pop it shorty
Dont stop rock it naughty
He aint a stunner man he just a runner man
Summer time we have summer jams in the hummer man
VERSE 2
This is Ill town beat stomp New Jerusalem
Roll with killers is Christians and the murders Muslims
Watch what you do them might disrespect and shooting them
Get to meet your maker from my hooligans hoodlums
The garden state   on some ape shit
Your baby momma basically doing maintenance
This is a naughty vibe for naughty by
Just wanna set the liquor up trigger kick ups
Yeah i hit a hooter I bet the man ill move her
Aint a loser do her i roll with shitter shooters
A qualified Gaddafi modified kasaki
Im more negro in the hood they call me hero
A born Nino you an alter boy with an alter ego
Word to the father I put the spunk in a spotter
Im hotter I put that on my nigga   RIP 

CHORUS
VERSE 3
Picture get it start dont miss it  mark it
Im the shit in the market whether you shitted or sharted
You better stop if you fridget or with it
Committed or quitted uplifted or diss it you did it you get it
Aint no mention of married Im itching to flare it
Bitching dead it snitching wear it
See i pass on them stank hoes but drop it like its hot and your ass is on your ankles
Who the bang attack flame attack  bang in the hood or bangin flash in Bangladesh
Born ambassador beats papi
First east coast niggas with and corn rows and creased kakis
Stop make the fiend flop jeans drop
Fuck your team watch how you lean on them team blocks
Hip hop with six Glocks in shit shape so shit stop
Fuck it I tip toe to the tip top
CHORUS
