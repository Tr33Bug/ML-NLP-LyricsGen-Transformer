Industry rule number 100 is funny
Tall midgets get short money
Dont bite the hand that feed you thats exciting fire
Shouldve done Celebrity Ghost Stories for all my ghostwriting
I cant fire the owner cause its me and my DJ
Give a grown man timeout Im out buy my swag on eBay
Cash I get it grab it feel the punishment from the savage
Legend lyrical lord they call you Uncle Adlib
Harlem shake shook up for real you so breezy
Starving for press thats why when he went and wiggled his weewee
My backup plan is fuck a backup man Im back
Need to call my nigga Busta buy Spliff Star off his contract
Never last you joke better dip the yolk
Im everlasting bro your ghetto pass revoked
Chorus
Stop bitching stop tripping stop riffing
Im not listening stop listening stop sniffing
You outta my army cant harm me or alarm me
Fuck your fat ass youre a bagel away from Barney
You wack rapper backstabber so greedy
Ill make it so damn theyll never see your wack ass on TV
Eat me time to find your own zone watch your tone
Naughty year was niggas throwing you a bone holmes
I hate the leach lurking off of what I built cause Im real
Now Im doing sidedeals that I feel
Many of your dudes love the ending the grove
Its the ending of you mr Winnie The Pooh
Chorus
