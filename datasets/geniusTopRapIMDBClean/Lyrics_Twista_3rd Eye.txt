See you with the eye
Rather at the apex of a pyramid or the forehead of a cyclops
Talking shit to me make sure youre off the right block
Still Imma come through in the Mercedes Benz white drop
Might stop but only if I know you I dont mean to blow you with the statement
But I dont be fuckin with these niggas and thats why they be hatin
Cause I stay in the zone I be alone so excuse me if Im wrong
Im off a kush and when the THC affect the dialect I be as free as the wind and fire
Let the energy in me be my empire yet the remedy for me is ultraviolet violence silence
All the critics when I spit it Imma creature of punishment when it comes to torturing
And with this rap shit Im a beast
Balling like Im Uncle Pauly and all of the above we go in the club incognito with the snub
East be the direction that Im prayin in
But Im a Midwest nigga
Mean with a verse something fly I am seen with it first
So they can say Where you get that nigga
The essence of my vocabularys exquisite when I enter into a realm taking me to the helm
Of lyricism you gonna be callin me majesty callin a tragedy that you gotta see on film
So I salute and advise you not to shoot you are not equivalent or parallel to my level
Subpar So coming at me wrong is worse then being on the carousel with the devil
I can turn these happy homes and these fake MCs into whole apartment buildings and vacancies
Bakeries cook em til they done whoop em til they wump put a funk in them niggas
Watch what you say to me
Dont play with me Imma make a hater pray to me
God cause Im hard and my flows is the coldest
You are no threat dont step I am a descendent of Imhotep yes Moses knows this
Of annihilation we are on a brink I be smokin up the stink so before somebody thinks
See how my stylell get ugly as Michael Spinks   when I rap about the Sphinx instead of about minks
Knowledge is power so he taught you bout your third eye
Type of shit I make a bird swim fish fly
Fuck it touch the sky on the first try
Man a motherfucker could never control me only squeeze me and hold me
Is what the fe came up and told me Now is she bold g
But in my mouth is where the gold be cause I be playin her like Goldy
AbSoul I know ya know me
Pack of Backwoods jar of that good yeah I blow it by the OZ
I never sleep you getting cozy
I made it out the jungle I should write a book about Mowgli
I aint a killer but dont push me
I hit you with a Sig but Id rather smoke up on a stogie
God MC you could say Im holy
The ghost of Alori Joh walk with me so a nigga never lonely
Solo  Soulo  but Top Dawg is a army
Flow AT and T nigga 4 gs
Might be the hip hop Bob Marley Taking shots at politicians while I roll weed
Easily EazyE without the Jheri Curl Juice
Off that drank that make you think every girl cute
On top of the pyramid A angles acute
Mark of the Beast on me him her and you
Money in the safe in case theres a lawsuit
Because any lumberjack would say they saw you
Me and Twista in the cut twistin up a blunt what the fuck you want
