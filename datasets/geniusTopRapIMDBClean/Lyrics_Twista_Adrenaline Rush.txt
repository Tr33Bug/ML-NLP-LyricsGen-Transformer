What happens when you combine the darkness with the light
Im bringing pain like two bad nurses
In the pain from these here motherfuckin verses
Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
To the dirt shit first picks and usin autos to work with
Slugs to the shirt shit  just to squirt shit 
Im hitting it with an expert kick
And burst til the earth split leave you hurt bitch
Show you how worser than worst get in the zone
See the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin the curtains bitch
When adrenalines pumpin 
I dont understand discussion only hear certain shit
Im a misunderstood nigga and Im off my square
High got me reversin clips and dispersin shit
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge
Im charged up like Scarface gettin shot up on the ledge
No pain instead of caine I took a blunt off to the head
So tell me what it said 
Retaliate with lethal repercussion
I feel the reefer rushin
To go into thangs like its a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl hot like Im finna steal
To get the kickin shit
For niggas and bitches that I kick it with
I was born to get you pumped up
Its like some lead bust
Cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo heads bust when you jumped up
Cause what I said mustve got you geeked
My eyes red puffed
From smokin shit that niggas hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act a bitch on the side
If we have to then the whole Westsidell let the shit go on
And ride when the trigga bust
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his oppositions chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his oppositions chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Pullin up and bailin out like were carsick
Im ready to start shit
Started buryin some heads like an ostrich
Unload the whole cartridge
And throw the shells in the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve
What Ive accomplished
Yung Buks my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
Then set out on a journey too astonished to stomp this
Worshipped in the hearts of all the niggas to get em charged
Whats the real reason
All you haters tried to murder me so now its kill season
And even though Im still bleedin
Ima keep comin because Im still breathin
And yall cant trace me
Im burying my victims in the wall like Gacy too lyrical
And since the snip of my umbilical these flows been critical
My music is miracle its like Im biblical
Kill like Im nuttier than Buddy Love
And still wouldnt leave a bloody glove
And start the truck up
And speed the fuck up
Getaway smokin the blunt up
Adrenaline pumpin veins erupt Im pumped up
And Im calibrated at 360 degrees
See thats 300 niggas thats gon die
Bout 60 slugs to do this deed
Psycho Drama 
We too much for the industrialist to fuck with this
On the brink of fuckin up some shit
Dismantle deduct some shit
Its hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
What niggas got nerves to do 
So I guess Ill just take that fuckin nerve from you
Then think what Im on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh let semi close yo curtains fool
From killin the verses fool
I be one of the worstest dude
You the who 
Im the worstest
Look about 9 millimeters above your surface
Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose
Bitch you hurtin
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his oppositions chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his oppositions chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Let your adrenaline rush
