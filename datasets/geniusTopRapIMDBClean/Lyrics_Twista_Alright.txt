On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My my my whips is sidebyside
He just talkin mines outside
Do you mind if I
Take you on a test
Do you have allwheel drive
And if that baby purr Im gonna baby her
Bitches gon hate and maybe worse
Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
Just to work
I know you was on purpur
But this is a whole new arena
See niggas come by talkin bout they make it rain
Ill make that bitch Katrina
Mr Kanye Omari with my Entourage no Ari
And a motorcycle jacket no Harley
She said dude thats cool
Gnarly
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright
Twista where you at
Abracadabra did he vanish
Hurry up and come out
But I aint want to panic
I say that Im in the zone
But they dont understand it
Physically Im here but mentally Im on another planet
And it only kinda made em look at me like I was stupider
Now they askin which planet is it Jupiter
So I let the money show cause I know stacks could talk
Im mackin on bitches with my intergalactic thoughts
In my Mercedes Benz
Pull up on a chick and holla at her and her lady friends
Like as rich as an Arabian
Im kickin pure flows
Euros they pay me in
For what I put together in the dungeon
Im lookin for a UK chick with a nice onion
Never beat it up like Paul Bunyan
And I cant believe they let an American Werewolf in London
Especially when drinking Gs with a tonic
Steady be trippin while smokin on the hydroponic
When I spit it like this they be callin me bionic
Kanye with the Twist nigga how ironic
And Im astonished haters dont wanna see me on
They wanna know how Twista get the easy dome
Swag off the chain twentythrees be chrome
Artful Dodgers with the Yeezys on
Gone
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright
Im blowin on flame but yours is all white
And Imma pull up in the Bentley all white
Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes
Sippin on some Louis and partyin all night
Phonyass people I dont feel they demeanor
So I hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus
One of raps heroes who came from zero
Makin something out of nothing call me Gilbert Arenas
Now Im fuckin with divas that rock the stadiums
Blow my brains back til my face be numb
I am the shit
It dont make me numb
Rockin wit a swagger like I got an eightfeet gun
And my flow be colossal cause I spit the impossible
Whether with rhythm no limit to what I can do
See through a prism when I conquer an obstacle
And always get money no matter how illogical
I follow through because uh
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright
