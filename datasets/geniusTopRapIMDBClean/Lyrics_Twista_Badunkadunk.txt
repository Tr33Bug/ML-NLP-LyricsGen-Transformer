And when you shake it for the dollar holler when you see me
Now I dont want to see no fatty full of rigor mortis
Go ahead and jiggle it for the one with money in his hands
Go and get up off the stage with your thick ass
And come over here by the table and give me a lap dance
Bend it over come and get this dust
Got a player thinking that we fitting to cut
Gots to hit that from the back
Shorty got a little junk in the trunk
Look at how she make one butt cheek freeze
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast
Look at how she switch make the other cheek move
Then work both sides and clap that ass
Remember them times
When you met two shortys and you really want the cutey
But you let her slide
Cause the other girl with her got a big old donkey booty
Now shorty think she fine
Only if she really knew the truth
