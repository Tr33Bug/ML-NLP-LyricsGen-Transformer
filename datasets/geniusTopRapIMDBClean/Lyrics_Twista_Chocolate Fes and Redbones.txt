Rollin down the street on some shiny twentyfours
Pullin up with chocolate fes and redbones  la la la la la 
Blowin on some dro while I spend my money flow
Pullin up with chocolate fes and redbones  honey no 
Rollin down the street on some shiny twentyfos
Pullin up with chocolate fes and redbones  chocolate fes and redbones 
Blowin on some dro while I spend my money flow
Pullin up with chocolate fes and redbones  ohh yeah

One two three
You aint never seen a motherfucking pimp like me
Stay up in the street lookin for honies throwin money in the club
Chubby thug ballin in the white tee
Roll a Swisher up and take it to the head
Havin fantasies of havin me two bitches in the bed
Darkskinned and lightskinned like Mike both of em lookin right
Spectacular when I get up in them legs
Have you ever seen a lightskinned freak
Butter pecan or vanilla nipples and the pussy pink
Hazeleyed jet black baby hair thatll hurt yo hearrrrrrt 
Have you ever seen a darkskinned freak
Sexy and chocolate when she dropping it my African Queen
When she start sweating she look like a Hershey bar 
The three of us need to travel to an exotic place
Where yall can double up on me take me to outer space
Or we can keep it ghetto and hang in the hood on the porch
And later on we can fuck in front of the fireplace
But for now Im only dippin through the block
Expressin to you all of the feelings in my chest
Wishin I could find a couple of girls on what Im on
So they could help me end my stress until then Im just
w new ad libs

Look at lil red
Talkin jazzy at the mouth cause she think she the shit
Thinkin everybody around supposed to bow down to her
Cause she spoiled but shes still my bitch
Now come take a look at miss black
Always got an attitude and she stay on the attack
Why you always wanna whoop a nigga ass tellin me Im bogus
But I love you cause yo ass so fat
So now I gotta pimp my ride
Custom interior computer and chrome on the side
Paint job can make you look like butter rollin
But you aint rollin unless you got some twentyfos on the ride
And the doors suicide
Niggas hatin but the bitches on the dick when the doors go up
Let the enemy see you good
When the homies in the ride and the forks and the Fours go up
steady bendin through the block and Im tryin to find a ho
And Im pullin up with somethin candy painted mayyyne 
Everybody call me Twista representer for the city of the dough
Standin out on Madison screamin out aint it mayyyne 
Hit em with the one two three
w more different ad libs 
You know I love my chocolate fes and my redbones
I still love my peanut butter and my caramel girls
I got love for my chocolate fes and my redbones
I still love my peanut butter and my caramel girls
