17 years of goin and flowin
And showin these niggas when it come to beatin me nobody could
I been spittin venom ever since the days UGK been rappin
And talkin bout puttin diamonds on the wood
Pull up in a old Cadillac before I got some fame
I done got that guap and the number one spot now I ride a Range
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we aint makin money off rap then we got them thangs
Got the 8 dollar hollas two for 15s
A 4 and I split a nine piece so you can hit the whole brick
How I run it by makin a 100 every summer
Pullin up in the Hummer can make a nigga so sick
How I constantly come up with hits and steady be gettin fans
Is only because a nigga flows sick
So aint no debate everybody know Im great
Any muthafuckas that hate can suck my dick
Motherfuckas actin like they dont know me
But they know just who I am Im a motherfuckin killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
Cause Im a killer a mass murderer the realest nigga that you ever heard of
Motherfuckas actin like they dont know the deal
But they know just what to do
Everybodys talkin in the streets so you know that Im comin straight for you
