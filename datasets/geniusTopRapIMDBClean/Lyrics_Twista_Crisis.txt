Everybody got the memo Michael Myers man Im mental
Messy murder monumental mixed my mind
Metamorphosis made it mainey my many maneuvers
Missin my malice malevolent mister N9ne
Mediocre motherfuckers my motive makin minimal
Maniacal makin me mesh my line
Monster Musical massacre
Metaphysical man you may never match my grind
When Im bustin you think Im poppin the E
Hoppin to N9na boppin need no stop and lockin the B
Niggas be droppin off in a coffin talkin to me
Better flee never see Tecca Neez I be forever
Look at the KOD demolish Im polished
I get dollars I get the guala mixologist and many I sell
You will never see the light of day right away
You will die but I hide away say goodbye  Ill see you in Hell 
True shots awhos stopped the crews water
You soft I move rocks a Moustapha
Boondock ya boo SooWoo what the
Through chakras you lost the new nana
Out with the weak and in with the raw
Put you in deep and have your mama seekin the law
Freaking the beat I get to peekin
Leavin you mauled with the saw
Aint nobody beatin me in a brawl
Yall got to know I stop the show
Pick you off of the pillar you know I drop the foe
Sick of an abyss of sicker suckers sock a ho
Nigga oh you aint even in my optical
Ill shock ya though I rock the flow
Nah not so low like burnin optimo
Wassup to Joe from my block the MO
I did it to death and my nigga I got to go
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you dont know the truth
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage
It can be an emergency making you have to evacuate the premises killing the audience up on the stage
We are an anomaly coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
You gotta be loving the cut if I get to fucking em up
Im probably bustin em up and vodka be up in the cup
And drama be nothing to us
A combination of some oddities coming to crush
And yall will be nothin to touch your body we cutting em up
Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted
Like we bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck
Whenever you recollect it me and Tech will tackle niggas
And see em like Liam Neeson in Taken
Or Taken 2 better yet Tekken 2
Wrecking you like I was Baek or Eddy
Im ready to reappear like I was Yoshimitsu
From a darker side of the universe
You are versus a predator is what you didnt know
When they will go and get you
Then Im immediately about to punish him run its a mutation
Of horror thatll treat you like a ho and hit you
But Tech me and you can speak on it even type of terminology
And hurt em as if they didnt know we were an odyssey or an oddity
Its a murder probably if not then I bet you that we cause a verbal lobotomy
Tell them niggas to make a move then when I move I wanna bruise
And show em they finna lose and I refuse to be a fool
I kill em and keep it cool but Ima do what Ima do
Because Im breakin the rules lets go
Bust you with lyrics how I shoot this
Or either we gon say fuck you while chucking up the deuces
The booth is where the living proof is and Im ruthless
I can leave your whole teams caduceus in nooses ooh its
Somebody you dont really want to get into it with
Im mythical difficult and I dont know if itll
Be a wise thing for you to do as far as tangling with the unusual
Orion Im iron Im scientifical
Indivisibility within the infrastructure of the family
That I created is inevitable
Especially if we committed to getting money
So fuck the haters because its the paper that you better get you
Take your mental into space and leave it alone
An outer dimension because I can get deep with a song
The look of a fiend Ima put em to sleep with the chrome
Unlock the machine fuck him if he aint breathing alone die
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you dont know the truth
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage
It can be an emergency making you have to evacuate the premises killing the audience up on the stage
We are an anomaly coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
You gotta be loving the cut if I get to fucking em up
Im probably bustin em up and vodka be up in the cup
And drama be nothing to us
A combination of some oddities coming to crush
And yall will be nothin to touch your body we cutting em up
Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted
Like we bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck
