Crook County  BONE Crusher Mix  Lyrics
In the Chi its kill or be killed hussle or die
You gotsta take the pie momma didnt lie
Look in my eyes you see the realness
The nine makes you feel this
The pain that Im going through til Im sitting on millions
My minds on that paper wishin upon a caper
I need to stack now Ill repent for my sins later
When Im living greater the mind state of a Westside native
Its sick in the head dodgin Feds everyday
See me load the AK watch em run when we spray
Get the fuck up out my way and for pray that this pistol play
Cause when Im heated Im gunning til theres nothing in sight
So cancel Christmas muthafucka fuck you and your life
Niggas in my mob is too suave
We ride hundred G cars in it like the world is ours
Dont disrespect or get your chest split like cigars
In this county of crooks tryin to avoid jail bars
But its so hard to make cheese especially
If you aint got no PhD or connect on phat keys
See mobstability is for niggas with nothing to lose
Going psycho from this drama you go through paying dues
I get a buck in your side tryin to hussle for a ride
Or hittin the block to find out one of your guys just died
So dont come to the Chi its just risking your health
Cause KTown niggasll bomb on that ass like a stealth
In the county of crooks gangbangers killers and slangers
With judges be quick to hang us homies and strangers
No bluffin we bustin
Like a kamikaze watch our bodies come up
War    then its on now we gon strap up whats up
Our countys so crooked Psycho Drama invented the style
Then damn near everybody took it and passed it around
Now these muthafuckas all look and see cause we puttin it down
And aint no sooner or later the world gon realize they fakin
Then snatch they tapes of the shelves and break em eliminate em
Just as fast as Creators Way can create shit
Now they all on some hation just like them nigga
Like aint nobody done a thing
But we run a reason around these bitches
The more tapes we make the more they all go broke so fuck em
If it aint no love then it aint none
If it is then nigga then say something
Cause more of this beats gon stomp and keep on stompin
And Drama make that solemn promise
That shorty flyin all on niggas business


From a lyrical Crook County look around you found me
I mustve been bad to the bone get the mask and the chrome
This shot gotta die from a blast to the dome
NiggaMotha Fuck a Ouija board
I receive my blessings from Gs and Lords ninemillies and swords
For the art of war niggas mustve found breathin bored
Tellin me to look into your eyes all I see is a bitch
Saw Krayzie in New Orleans scary vic
Talkin bout you was lovin my shit
Hit the bud and got sick on that shittalkin odyssey mumblin rb
You can keep the apology you done tried to dishonor me
Kill the Hoes of the Harmony
Just when you thought it was safe
The Bone niggas bout to get slaughtered and raped
I can slow down and audit the tape
Yall bigger than all yall who thought it was fake
Now watch fourfees on the stage bleed from the braids
Die on the first on the month cause its worse than the blunt
Why would you compete to be doomed now you gon see EazyE soon
Feel the boom of the reprecussion cause the reefers still rushin
When I reach and start bustin
Im a Bone Crusher crook county or nothin
Aint no bluffin
