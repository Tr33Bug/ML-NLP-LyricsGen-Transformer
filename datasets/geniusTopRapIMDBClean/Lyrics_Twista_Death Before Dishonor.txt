Always ever all days death bef
Always ever all day death before dishonor
Comin back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin to steal me shit you gon have to kill me
If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
Its like Uh ah
Muthafucka cant fight the feelin the way Imma fuck him
Have an orgasm and before the morgue has him killed him as if a fourfive bucked him
Talk about a man being scared
I done killed him he dead in his tomb still shakin
Hit him in his body and his head
Now he found up in heaven with the wound still achin
I wonder if his voice still breakin
Better be cause I readily
Hit him with gats and styles thats heavily
Armed and dangerous and deadly
Them ahead of me receive two holes like a letter B
Better you instead of me
Break our peace can increase your chances
To delete your advances
If its faint I can paint this piece on canvas
With a paint brush that a nigga cant trust
Like a god so I cant rush wont crush
If you ever heard about a crew that cant bust then muthafucka it aint us dont touch
A mic or a gun if you aint gonna use it do it
Claimin your weapons and TEC
And you gonna be ejecting fluid prove it
Cause no matter who it 
Is KTown and Westsidell leave a bitch sheddin tears
The young kill everyday the old itchin to kill cause they aint left nigga dead in years
Shoot him dead in his head
This style of flow is a verbal Calico make a chest ripple
They get a call from the sky if they all dont die better leave the rest crippled
Always ever all day death before dishonor
Comin back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin to steal me shit you gon have to kill me
If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
Always ever all day death before dishonor
Comin back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin to steal me shit you gon have to kill me
If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
Life is priceless if you try to take mine leavin muthafuckaz cold as a crisis
With a technique as old as Isis and mics as my control devices
Or do I gotta get off into some nigga shit Show the bigger dick  with a thicker clique
Thatd be hazardous if I let the trigger click you dont benefit if a nigga get
Off on the rage even if its just a little bit so goon with the riddle shit
If you got something to stress then get it off your chest and we can take it to the middle bitch and go on
Get it on and I bet you that the outcome is that Im leavin niggas outdone cut up
Bullets hard to see a muthafucka outrun just because he let his mouth run shut up
And sit back if you know whats good for you I can still overthrow you
I dont give a fuck about the fact that the hood know you dont make a nigga have to show you
That Imma die before I let you make an ass of me snap as if you took a blast at me and cause tragedy
That was how it was that was how it is and thats the way it has to be  always ever all day death be 
Always ever all day death before dishonor
Comin back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin to steal me shit you gon have to kill me
If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
Always ever all day death before dishonor
Comin back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin to steal me shit you gon have to kill me
If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
Its like Uh ah
Sit back and let the shit I say marinate
I pull the stage curtain back like Norman Bates performin hate
Smokin on some reefer preparin fate
Its a constant scuffle for us
White boys with the shit hittin licks in the hustle for us
My nigga lucky made him bleed for months
If you proceed to bust if you a different type of breed from us
So petty niggas yall need to hush
Two straight to you brainll mean pains inflicted
Even if it aint thangz a joint pointblank range til my brain is wicked
Aint even lived out a quarter of your lifetime tryna push product
And aint servin the right kind aint strivin to write rhymes
But Imma straighten yo lifeline
Through the pipeline of a vocal combustion plus Im with killers
Jaw stealers flow builder rushin parties bloody body chillers
Pretty casket fillers
Cause these niggas here got their shit together
We campaign the Creators Way
It dont gotta be on but then again whatever
Always ever all day death before dishonor
Comin back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin to steal me shit you gon have to kill me
If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
Always ever all day death before dishonor
Comin back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin to steal me shit you gon have to kill me
If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
