Huh
Yea baby girl you know how its going down
2003 Do or Die JP Twista still
Well when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick nice shape 54
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click in the Expo
Im city sharp buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural never walk from the store
Gimme a minute and get down with a pro
P I M P P O get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex we can sport mine called SEX
Platinum link all in effect
I can pick head but Im a bad for a check
In the truck though so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back but Im trying to relax
PLAYER giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money cuz she know she a star
Did you wanna ride in my car
Do you  Do you Do you Do you 
23s like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro girl if you wanna blaze
You can let your hair down while the AC blow
Before you get in I just need to know
Do you  Do you Do you Do you 
Ill keep it on the low
Do you Do you
In the mood like yes yall
Rather be let it test yall
Light the B if its special
Can I undress to relax yall
Well stretch out like a Lex ball
If its that raw to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it if its that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I cant believe how they sent them off
Took the number then Im in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh he flossing
Baby girl I dont do this often
In the 5 double 0 for sho
We still ride the Cadillac slam the doors
Suppose I kick back keep the flows
Dressed to impress then flex the ho
Check the dough
Do you  Do you Do you Do you 
Ill keep it on the lo
Do you Do you
Do you
An it really dont matter where we go
Lets sip this Henny pop this
Mo
Before I strip you I just need to know
Can I do you
Now I was geeking when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty and the brother was a 50ball
For you I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if Im a get the draws
Let me know if Im in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin thru stunting why are you running
Cuz Im coming with some pimptype game
Iced out charm chromed out truck
Coming thru balling like I dont really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty an purple with the windows up
When Im sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while Im running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb
Hold it in then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Dont ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp sprees
You can let me down easy
Cuz still ill be the player Twista slash be a PIMP
Now baby do u
