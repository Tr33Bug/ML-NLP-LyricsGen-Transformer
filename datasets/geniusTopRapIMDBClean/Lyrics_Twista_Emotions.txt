 Let me play with your emotions
Well a motherfucker could never control me only squeeze me and hold me
Thats what the ho came up and told me
Now is she bold G But in my mouth is where the gold be
Cause I be pimpin her like Goldie
Gotta get paid in this age my fingers aint made
Just to be choppin up confetti with if its already thick
You better study nigga if you aint with it you can get it
Cause I aint even on that petty shit
So who the fuck do I competi with
The rhythm I kick is like a rhythmlywickedarithametic
Pick em up quick and then give em the dick thinkin Im innocent
They up in the mall shoppin for me pickin a fit
I got them heffers nose red
And when we get in the bed I be leavin em with rose legs
Stuffin that made em wanna pose dead
But you already got em until you get up in them hoes head
I dont mean to sound bogus or nothin
But its the bomb when I be havin them cuties thinkin
Im in love with em when Im rubbin em
Be gettin pub with em in a club with em
Smokin dub with em huggin em freakin in the tub with em
After gettin paid from her she aint trippin
Cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name I gotta tame here it go
Now we speakin with the game on ways to make mo
Let me play with your  emotions ho
To the rhythm of a hihat take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind body and soul I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control you know its worth more than
Diamonds and gold now dont be bogus and deny that
Now how the fuck you gon act ho I saw you creepin out the back do
What you runnin from a mack fo Lay you on your back slow
Cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afro
Come and take a glimpse of the stairs
Its the aroma of a pimp in the air I betcha notice the smell
Its like a lotus when I flow dis cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didnt notice then you bogus as hell
Im puttin women under my spell like Im up in their brain
Pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy thats feminine
Theyre fillin em up with adrenaline got em geekin
Were speakin approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission is surrenderin it aint no endin if its on
With a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place with the right mind and the right line
You can get a lifetime contract
They be wise until they look into your eyes
A shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib lay low hit her off from behind
Then she signed on the dottedline the ho was like
Oooohh Daddy why you doin me like this
Id do anything to be with you you got me gone in the head
Ya mind I dont mean to make a disaster up
Like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn
Then how could you still show the bastard love
I guess its cause Im cold shit
Thought you was gon be spendin me I betcha think you sho did
But game recognize game now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch thats what you get for tryin to gold dig now
Yeah this be Hype the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul
I should make your funky emotions
Nothin is good unless you play with it
Play with me baby
I know you think its blasphemy
But wont you give up when she ask for me After he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Magesty I had to see
And when you get paid there is some cash for me is it a tragedy
That I can get her so gone the ho be trippin talkin up her love a lot
But the only love I got is when Im grippin like I wanna hug the Glock
Or when I rub the twat or pickin up a dub at spots
Fuck the ho thugs the clubs and the phony perpetrators with dimes
The speed knots match vooDo or Die Psycho Drama Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin with em gators and dons collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
Sso keep walkin the next time you hear grown folks talkin
Motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the filet minion the grey poupon
Them hoes are staked to charm because we make the bomb
Now I dont mean no harm but either come on in or get on gone
And let me pull my pouch of snuff
In between your thighs come take a pull and vibe
And let your tongue go coastin low now
