I be the grossest nigga spitting dirt about the hood
Then they go with the flow thats ferocious
Kill em off with the minimal dosage
You dont wanna see the result of my ultimatum when I focus
And I got the streets on lock
Muthafuckas feast on Twist like they feast on Pac
Im a beast and the beats dont stop
Twista and the Legendary Traxster and we so hot
Kill em off if we ever get into it in a minute Imma murder em and put em in a bodybag aint nothing they can do about it
Dump em in the streets youll never know it was Get Money that was in the controversy cause I off whoever knew about it
Take it up another level when Im off of tropical and raise it up another decimal in my mentality
Physically I be from the inner city of the Windy City but Im spiritually from another galaxy
And I be one of them niggas that never do give a fuck
What you say as long as Imma get em up
Witness that Im fly look at the way I kick back
Quickest in the Chi guess you can say I spit that
Devin Hester D Rose
Never see me at a show in cheap clothes
Take over the game no cheat code
And Imma ball like Shaq no free throws Im on
When it be coming to this rap shit Im top shotta
Midwest godfather honored in the city like Bambaataa
And Im a damn problem a speedknot mobsta
Blowing on the top ganja
Everything I wear cost top dollar
If youre on what Im on come fuck with me
If youre bout getting money come fuck with me
If you blowing on loud come fuck with me
If you need a new style come fuck with me
I am the Higgs boson
Mass of the rap lance rigs with photons
Come on write that over more gigs and role bombs
Make you have to hold your kids in your arms
Got you the remedy
We stand the test of time like Im the statue of liberty
And Im bringing the wrath on my enemy and Im an immortal
When Im in a portal full of math and chemistry
Telling you that Imma get em when I see you coming with the rhetoric that let me know you wanna get annihilated
I am at the pinnacle of what I wanna be then leave an enemy in back of me and anybody violated
Put em at the bottom of the barrel Im a animal
I kill em with the ammunition there gon be no murdering me
Coming to the surface of the Earth and the purpose of work is the worth of a person per hundred million money for me
Protons neutrons electrons
Building blocks to a decepticon
You just met with tron the upset LeBron
Kobe Wan Kenobi
Left hand and Im a black Ginbili
Shootin em until they marry death in holy matrimony
Shit on muthafuckas if I ever catch em acting phony


When it be coming to this rap shit im top shotta
Midwest god father honored in the city like bambaataa
And Im a damn problem a speedknot mobstaz
Blowing on the top ganja
Everything I wear cost top Dollar
If youre on what Im on come fuck with me
If youre bout getting money come fuck with me
If you blowing on loud come fuck with me
If you need a new style come fuck with me
