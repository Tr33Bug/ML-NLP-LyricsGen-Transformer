Now I know its been a long time
Since a muthafucka done made a good song about reefa
And who better for you to handle this
Than the T the number 1 analyst on the cannabis sativa
Go and get a pillow and a cigarillo if I know whats the killa
Im gonna roll one up jo
Open the Backwood up trippin on me cuz I was sloppy
I better get fucked up though
I be smokin four different kinds of kush
Its the best of me especially the Purple and the OG
But yall might call it the Granddad
Better savor it and take a pull slowly
Eye lids low aint no doubt about it that somebodys gon peep me
Go head and ride I think Ima chill because Im kinda sleepy
Me and my niggas in my crew would get into it now we be at odds hardly
Cuz we smokin on the ounce of the Ganja that Bob Marley
Mea rock to the Reggae music whenever mefeelin spliff workin
Kill off any rude boy if you take away my herb thats a Earths sin
Smokin on that fire  smokin on that fire 
Puffin on that dro  puffin on that dro 
Kush weed gets me higher  kush weed gets me higher 
And the diesel get me blowed  and the diesel get me blowed 
Smokin on that fire  smokin on that fire 
Puffin on that dro  puffin on that dro 
Kush weed gets me higher  kush weed gets me higher 
And the diesel get me blowed  and the diesel get me blowed 
Blow Kush wit Ball and MJG
Smoke Haze I used to with Sigel
Freeway put me on to the Backwoods
And Bleek introduced me to Diesel
And Snoop turned me on to the Chronic
Smokin it I was feelin bionic
Lookin at me rollin the blunt
And Im huffin and puffin
I cant get enough of this stuff and Im losin my logic
You could smell it all on my follicles
And Ima follow you cuz of the Dro
But if it aint I call a audible
I be gettin nothin but love cuz I be smokin the bud
Juss lookin like us from a High Times article
Particles I be grindin up into Hash
I put some on yo blunt if you come up with the stash
So take it to the head as a gift from coupe
But if I share wit a bitch Ima be fuckin her ass
Stay havin sessions and my ends is plenty
So when Im smokin my friends is wit me
Make em feel a slow breeze
Cuz I blow trees like the Windy City
Lemme call up the weed man
Cuz if I hear he got new shit we on it
Me and you could hook up and go get a ounce
And I got twofifty on it


Smokin on that fire  smokin on that fire 
Puffin on that dro  puffin on that dro 
Kush weed gets me higher  kush weed gets me higher 
And the diesel get me blowed  and the diesel get me blowed 
Smokin on that fire  smokin on that fire 
And the puffin on that dro  and the puffin on that dro 
Kush weed gets me higher  kush weed gets me higher 
And the diesel get me blowed  and the diesel get me blowed 
Im extra blowed top flo in the double tree in the ChiTown
Where Im smokin this Kush shit back to back
Got me rippin track to track
Like Webbie say Where that real at
That onehit and you feel that
I know Im a dog I done smoked that Train Wreck I aint done yet
Ima smoke till I hurt my chest
On the East Coast they feed me mayne
Put me wit the Diesel mayne
Got me in New York eatin everythang
Even try the Jamaican Kush stick to the bag
Put my whole trick on his ass
Dont like to brag but I smoke
Choke on the best of the best
I be higher than giraffe pussy when Im up in the West
Im talkin tired Im so high
Man I done smoked that piss cat
Smell good lemme hit that
Thats why Micheal Phelps did that
Smokin on that fire  smokin on that fire 
And the puffin on that dro  and the puffin on that dro 
Kush weed gets me higher  kush weed gets me higher 
And the diesel get me blowed  and the diesel get me blowed 
Smokin on that fire  smokin on that fire 
And the puffin on that dro  and puffin on that dro 
Kush weed gets me higher  kush weed gets me higher 
And the diesel get me blowed  and the diesel get me blowed
