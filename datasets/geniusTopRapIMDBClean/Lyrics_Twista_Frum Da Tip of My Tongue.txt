Droppin a flow like this be breakin the suckers
And rippin the rhythm and showin Im bringin the feel of my tongue
And be makin em manifest that I be rockin the young
Flowin this style I be singin and bringin
Its breakin the people and go in the mind of a teen
Be makin em hear it and manifest up in him that Im a star to become
Quick the lyrical style Imma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
Cause hiphop is becomin complicated never be left hung
Bringin a style like this kinda quick and crisp
A lyrical twist be comin up from ChiTown
I know that hiphoppers all over thatll be stung
How was the rhyme brung 
Frum the tip of my tung  7X 
How was the rhyme brung 
Frum among the tip of my tung
Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin the hiphop hypes my types of flowin but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That Imma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack cause yall cant manifest what I be sayin
Think Im a lyrical midget watch me then say feefifofum
Flowin this like a veteran that Im incredible is what they be stung by
When Imma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a weewee
Then see me gee we be DJ Jihad and TT
Steppin and then Imma find a lyrical line thatll flow from me like peepee
Rockin and me stylin rockin and me stylin wildin
Them say me tracks be wack I just sip them like them coco
Loco a lyrical thing I sling and cling like SingSing merciless like Ming
Watch me come and stiff in em like a photo
Funky funky funky stylin wildin
Imma drop in a flow that breaks and takes a lyrical wiz to wax a funky scholar
Flowin a hyper type of song that I sung from the lung
Breakin em up in a snap I think that I better thank Allah


Face the lyrical rhythm of this lick I throw in a blister of a body
Breakin em up so quick that I can even bruise hair
Rhythm will rock blocks and funky track drops
Dont wanna come in the door but when youre hearin this
Do I hear a knockknock whos there
Twista breakin em off in a magical rhythmus manifestation of a lyrical racin
Chasin suckers that my funky rhythm elects
Wrote this quote this notice how I wreck
My funky hocus pocus broke his neck
