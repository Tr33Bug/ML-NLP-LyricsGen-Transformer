Dear love I was thinking how I should be starting this
Magnificent ways to light your life up like an arsonist
Put my heart in this
Ticklin you funny but when we start to kiss marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin with your homies gettin fucked up
I got fantasies of you carrying me home
Hope that you stayin alone
Im into givin pleasure echoin rhythms of my manly moans
Dont be playin me wrong Im too grown for games
Mental manipulation aint the occupation for the playa you facin Im strong cause you see I dont be really quite comin on the same
Boldly and bodily fluids with every word that curs
Girl you deserve some herb and company to be with
Fuck whoever you was gon leave with

Stick through the sheets and your arms
And see so dont be alarmed

Even though niggas in the hood is all soldiers
You stillll suffer the consequences defenseless
Thinkin about becomin my wife
If I rock you tonight you be the love of my life
Cause I be huggin you like Im huggin the mic
Plus Im the one thats rubbin you right
And able to stick my tongue off in your navel and lick til you drop
Even though I like to stick to twat
