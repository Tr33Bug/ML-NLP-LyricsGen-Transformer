Here I am
Here I am
Here I am
Oooh yeah here I am
Come and get me echoes
On a rainy die day early morn my lethal legacy was born
Ask any rapper around bout the fuckin mics I left torn
But they wont give me all my peeps and theres only one shot to get Gs
Got love for my MCs at home but some of them still hate on me
Look how many years I done repped hustled through the streets in the cold
Its fire but our first rap as ever signed the contract a decade ago
Put Chi name on records in the East put Chi name on records in the West
Put Chi name on records in the South bitch how you gon open your mouth
To the motherfuckin industry why you hate on me and my city
Would it be an imbalance of power if yall let Chi niggas get cheese
Or is it us holdin us back Think hard when you rollin your sack
Whatever the case my Chi nigga if its in my means I got yo back
What the fucks really goin on does the magazine know we on
Dont he know Im already established myself as Twista Corleone
Well Im holdin my city down aint goin nowhere here I stay
You know where I am if you hate me Come and get me
If you want me Come and get me Here I am
What did I do to deserve all of this madness around me
Found me in the studio buryin myself in work and was smokin herb
Tried to kick me to the curb
To the back to the ditch to the dump to the shack but I sprint in the front
In the Llac with a fifth and a blunt in the back with a bitch and a pump
And Im ready to bust at you hoes ready to dump lames in ditches
Steady makin fakers bleed LB family handle business
Comin into Twistas realm journey with me through the pain
The hurt just might make you envision drama that could turn you insane
How much of my chaos bring tears how many threaten my career
How many threatenin to murder me but bitch you know where I live
Who the fuck do you think I is Yall aint comin at wit no shotties
Why you think you can hurt like these years yo all of my peeps can you sawed
Think you finna bring out my fears Tell me why my success make you cry
And why my downfalls make you laugh but I bet my hydro got you high
Never let hate back me down stand firm like a man
If you want me Come and get me
Wanna kill me Come and get me Here I am
We got Geo like Neo of course we as sourcy as Morpheus
Or we as sick as sir Marcus Aurelius alias atheist
Against niggas who flow be the achiest against the aliens
And why they hate me is maybe its cause Im controllin this radius
Of this world and this whole universe dont believe let me spit you a verse
Just when you thought you was worst I come with words thatll make you disperse
My allies know Im too cold my enemies know I spit fast
My Lords know I bust that thang my gangstas know I whoop some ass
Mobsta family steady ride LB family steady click
While us and other crews collide choose your weapon take a pick
Load up clickclack its on  finna bust get back run home
Come at me bogus get whacked with a strap to the back of the dome
Industry niggas get gone heard yall be speaking big words
I show you some shit thatll blow you now slow you down like you sip syrup
The ChiTowns sacrificial lamb well here I stand
Firm if you hate me Come and get me
If you want me Come and get me Here I am
