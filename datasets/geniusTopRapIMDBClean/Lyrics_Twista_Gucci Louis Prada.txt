Uuuhhuh New Twista yall
I sat back long enough
Now its time for me to go psycho again
Rock my Gucci Louis Prada
Suzuki new Impala
Like Flukey I get them dollars
Boogie you do me nada
Make your vision decompose
Be so ridiculous when youre looking at the clothes
Like I got a garden I was looking at the hoes
And when they saw the apparel that was when a bitch chose
Then she froze I be looking so fabulous
Never the one to be tested cause itd be nothing for me
To just go in the closet to show what Im dressing like
Get em Im looking impressive and Im somebody not to be messing with
How I do it is a hell of a method
And when I be steppin up in the vicinity Imma demolish em
With the Gucci Louis and Prada thats on my body
Imma hurt em with a fit that cost a lil more than your residence
GuGuGucci Louis Prada like
Sushi Benihanas doushie do don dadas
Well tell her come on I got her
I be sick of you fucking with raggedy niggas
And looking ridiculous I could be taking you
Shoppin and poppin a bottle every time we go in a party
And probably I make it rain a couple dollars in my
Prada

Bellucci Lady Gaga

When Im stepping on the set
How I be rockin it be havin me lookin wet
Lyric acrobatic Im in the designer vest
If you lookin at me bogus Imma take it as a threat
When you see me Im in whatever popular
When I be rockin the fashion I be killin the minute
And look at the women the way that they be switchin and walkin
And workin the runway Im checkin on how astonishin they be lookin
VIP is like a fashion show
Everybody lookin the best they can look and when they do it it be
Swagga on a million and I be feelin em
So Imma tell her that I love how the ass look in her Prada
Gucci Louis Prada
In a suit we pray to the father
In a koofi you pray to Allah
But mostly the almighty dollar
Dont know why we so materialistic instead of being a mystic
But if I gotta do it Imma be the best and Imma shit on my opponent
When Im on it in the club they dont want it when Im in my
