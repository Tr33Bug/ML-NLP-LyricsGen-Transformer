Hope Ft Faith Evans Lyrics
I wish the way I was living could stop serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when Im on the block And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I wont have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail And I
Wish that my grandmother wasnt sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick And I  I wish 
Wish my homies wouldnt have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song And I  I wish 
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi And I
Wish My hommie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride And I  I wish 
Wish that God could protect us from the wrong
So all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
We would never break
Though they devastate
We shall motivate
And we gotta pray all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better so you aint gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer get ya money man life goes on
Lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful Hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay
Cause we hopeful
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up  I wish 
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have em trippin of the joy I bring
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man And I  I wish 
Wish the families that lack but got love get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lac thats on dubs And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder  you feel me   I wish 
And I hope all the kids eat
And dont nobody in my family see six feet  ya dig 
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone And I  I wish 
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R Kelly And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again  I wish 
That one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish we could never get the blues
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2  I wish 
I wish that we could walk a path stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Lets HOPE


Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay
Cause we hopeful
Wish the earth wasnt so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic
If you dont listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldnt have to go to war
Why cant we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr King Why cant we all just get along
Hope we can find a better way to shop and please And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if its you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church
And lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away let it take you away 
And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay  i know it aint easy 
Cause we hopeful
