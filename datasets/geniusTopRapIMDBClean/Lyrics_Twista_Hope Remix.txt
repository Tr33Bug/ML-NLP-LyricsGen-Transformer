Hope  Remix  Lyrics
I wish the way I was livin could stop
Servin rocks knowin the cops is hot when Im on the block
And I  wish my brother wouldve made bail
So I wont have to travel six hours to see him in jail
And I  wish that my grandmother wasnt sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick  I wish 
And I  wish my homies wouldnt have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand understand we lose a brother
And I  wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song  I wish 
And I  wish I could teach us all to fly
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold em high
And I  wish my homie Butch was still alive
And on that day of his death we had never took that ride
And I  wish that God could protect us from the wrong
So that all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
And uh  we will never break though they devastate
We shall motivate and we gotta pray all we got is faith
Instead of thinkin about who gon die today
The Lord is gon help you feel better so you aint gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward cause we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a lil prayer get your money man life goes on  Lets go 
Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it let it take you away
And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay
Cause we hopeful
I wish that you would show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people comin up  I wish 
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Write some music and have them trippin off the joy I bring
Shit  I wish that we can hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man  I wish 
And I  wish the families that lack but got love
Get some stacks brand new shack and a Lac thats on dubs
And I  wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder  I wish 
You feel me  and I hope all the kids eat
And dont nobody in my family see six feet  ya dig
I hope the mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone  I wish 
And I  wish I could give every celly some commissary
And no popo bring the heat on our peace like they did R Kelly
And I  wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again
Shit  then one day they can speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish we could never get the blues
Wish that I could bring back the people that died at E2
I wish that we could walk the path stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so them kids maintain up in the game  Lets go 
Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it let it take you away
And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way
I know it aint easy but  thats okay
Cause we hopeful
Wish the Earth wasnt so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic
If you dont listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country never even went to war
Why cant we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mister King why cant we all just get along
Hope we can find a better way to shop in peace
And I  hope we find a better way than coppin kis
And I  wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask  why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if its you doubtin
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the Heavenly Father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church  Lets go 
Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it let it take you away
And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way
I know it aint easy but  thats okay
Cause we hopeful
Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it let it take you away
And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way
I know it aint easy but  thats okay
Cause we hopeful
Hopeful oh hopeful
