You know that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours baby
You know that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours baby
You know that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours baby
You know that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours baby
Let me get straight to it
Her body like a Bugatti aint nothing like a Buick
When we get passionate Im in love with how you do it
No longer want to lease it I want the title to it
I might have blew it but now I know I want to own it
And get rid of opponents but I know fame can be blind
Never knew nothing like it is so one of a kind
I know that itll be stupid to not claim that its mine
She fit me like a glove hop up right on top of her man
And with no hands she give me a hug
Go ahead and reverse it baby you pop it like a drug
Asking me how I feel when Im inside your love
Better than the mall
In other words whenever Im up in your hall
I feel the ripples on the wall
A spectacular feeling when I get up in them draws
And with no hands she can even give an applause
Cause you got me gone all I can say is True that
Whenever I put the soap hole inside you at
Snug but you can see its something you aint new at
Ooh I can feel it when you do that
I can feel it when you do that she got a nigga stuck
Murder with the pussy now you just been cut
She got the kush in her bush and Imma take a puff
Telling me that its yours and i cant get enough
And she talkin like
Tell me that its the one
Tell me baby its the one you been waiting for
Tell me so I can make sure
Tell me baby cause you know that its yours
Ohwoah
You know that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours baby
You know that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours baby
You know that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours that its yours baby
You Know that its yours
She got a body like a Maserati
And she got the owochi cochi like a Rochi
Ass fuck her in the back of the Kawasaki
But the flow is a classic so its probably a Harley
Hotty be better than any thot around here
I see you  that I can be your manager
My place so let me show you I can handle ya
Scarface I fuck you right over the banister
And its the way that you be telling me that its yours baby
How Im a breath of fresh air you been so bored lately
And how you like to be reassured by me telling you that you the one
And how it be mine and how Im going crazy
You got a nigga caught up in it every time Im all up in it
Loving every minute all I know is I dont wanna finish
And Imma be talking to you while I hit it when you ask me to
Tell me that its the one
Tell me baby its the one you been waiting for
Tell me so I can make sure
Tell me baby cause you know that its yours
Ohwoah
That is yours
