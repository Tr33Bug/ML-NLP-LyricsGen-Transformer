Look At Me Now  Remix  Lyrics
I dont see how you can hate from outside of the club
You cant even get in
Hahaha lego
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sippin
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missin
Yeah yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years in two days
Ladies love me Im on my Cool J
If you get what I get what would you say
She wax it all off Mr Miyagi
And them suicide doors harikari
Look at me now look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now
Oh look at me now
Yeah fresher than a motherfucker
Lil nigga bigger than gorilla
Cause Im killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops I said on my dick
I aint really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
Im done
Now let a track go past like this and Twista not fuck with it
Yall done lost your mind
Let me show yall how I do it
Check it
I could hit you with the automatic flow
I could do any rhythm and any pattern that I wanna do the harder that it go
You could see blood spilling out from my body right in front of you and Ima get the dough
Now the way I be shinin be havin everybody lookin at me
Fuckin them up when I buck and Ima step and get off
I do a murder when Im trigger happy  like 
I got the intricate pattern to kill em for currency when I be animate Imma be makin em holler cause Ima get dollars when Im attackin the beat Im a scholar cause Im a personification of God so you better honor  what 
Mr Immaculate Im gonna wreck it a marvellous accurate lyricist
Ill be here forever
Haters wanna hate on me because they wanna hear whatever
I could spit a rhythm to a bitch and get her pussy wetter
Pimpin on a bitch and tell her I could get her pussy cheddar
So I get the camera then go and make a movie
Me up in the back of her tappin her gets the booty
Didnt wanna show my face even though she was a cutie
Nine millimeter and spillin millions of milliliters of life out a nigga if he talk shit
CEO step into my office
Coming with the awkward flow like Im sick
Go get your momma to bring a thermometer
My temperatures hot
Come up with a flow that would kill a industry and I could pick anything that I want off the lot
Never compatible cause I be intricate when I be serving you
When I be doin it at a pace I know they cant leave me
Think Twista could kill em on a track with Busta and Breezy Weezy Easy


Look at me now look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now
Oh look at me now
Yeah fresher than a motherfucker
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas how yall doin
Im Lil Tunechi Im a nuisance I go stupid I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I dont eat sushi Im the shit no Im pollution no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater got money on my radar
Dress like a skater got a big house came with a elevator
You niggas aint eatin fuck it tell a waiter
Marley said shoot em and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then Im like ol
I dont care what you say so dont even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
Thats word to my flag and my flag red
Im out of my head bitch Im outta my mind from the bottom I climb
You aint hotter than mine nope not on my time and Im not even trying
Whats poppin slime Nothin five and if they trippin fuck em five
I aint got no time to shuck and jive these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddys dead
You faggots scared cause Im too wild been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
Im so Young Money if you got eyes look at me now bitch
Look at me now look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now
Oh look at me now
Yeah fresher than a motherfucker
Okay okay
Is that right
Im fresher than a motherfucker
