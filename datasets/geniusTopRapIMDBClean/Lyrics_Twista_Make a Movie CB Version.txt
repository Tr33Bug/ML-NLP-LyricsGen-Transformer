Make a Movie  CB Version  Lyrics
The Perfect Storm its Twista and Chris Brown ya dig
Oh oh oh
I got a new one for ya lets make a movie baby
The Traxster
Twista got cars big swagger
Im a rock star like Mick Jagger
And I got bars that I spit faster
You a hot star and no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride on a journey
With the one that you call daddy yeah who gonna make you get it wet
But this time we gon do something romantic and different  yeah yeah 
Ill tell you about it when we get on the movie set
I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape
Plus I think yo face cute when its in HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me
When I pull my H2 up to your H3
You know that you wanna be in this movie
So dont be acting like a tripping with a stranger mission
Recording you while you loving me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me  oh 
Filming me licking until you say Cut
Ready for any footage you wanna get  oh 
Aint gotta call nobody else because I do my own stunts
Its the X rated version of a box office hit
I see she ready to strip for this
So let me get the music in get the tape in  oh oh oh oh oh 
Get the cameras in
Baby we dont need no script for this  script for this 
Ima throw a couple thousand baby strip for this  strip for this 
Let me pull my camera out and make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah
Baby we dont need no actresses  actresses 
Let me see what Im working with Ima break your back with this  back with this 
Let me pull my camera out lets make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah yeah yeah girl
Shawty we gonna make a movie
Got me loving it when Im feeling on the booty
Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol  oh oh 
Cause it do something to me oh
She look better than any chick in my perimeter  yeah 
Sexy I wish I could film every bit of her
Kissing right down to her stomach and then Ima
Tell her we could be in our personal cinema
I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then  oh oh 
Cause I wanna see how its coming out and going in  oh oh 
Let you see such a freak in me I hope this never leak on TMZ  woah oh 
This is 50 World Star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis  oh 
Im no director filming you for practice  oh 
And you know I think you a hell of a actress  oh 
Especially when Im shooting you on a mattress
Shawty straight to the top thats where we headed
And Ima see my name in the credits and be the shit if you let it
See something that you not really feeling
Then we can always go back and make an edit
Ill be sipping on Patron Platinum
She knew about the rapping but didnt know Id be on acting

So there get the tape in get the cameras in  oh oh oh oh oh 


Baby we dont need no script for this  we dont need no script for this
