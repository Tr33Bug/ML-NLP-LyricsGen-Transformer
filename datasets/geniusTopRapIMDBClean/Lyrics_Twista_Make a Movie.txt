So let me take you on a ride
On a journey with the one that you call daddy
Who gonna make you get it wet
But this time we gon do something romantic and different
Ill tell you about it when we get on the movie set
I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape
Plus I think yo face cute when its in HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me
When I pull my H2 up to your H3
You know that you want to be in this movie
So dont be acting like Im trippin with a strange ambition
Recording you while you loving me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me
Filming me licking until you say Cut
Ready for any footage you wanna get
Aint gotta call nobody else because
I do my own stunts
Its the X rated version of a box office hit
I see you ready to strip for this
So let me get the music in get the tape in get the cameras in  oh oh oh oh

Shawty we gonna make a movie
Got me loving it when Im feeling on the booty
Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol
Cause it do some thing to me
She look better than any chick in my perimeter
Sexy I wish I could film every bit of her
Kiss her neck down to her stomach and then Imma
Tell her we could be in a personal cinema
I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then
Cause I wanna see how its coming out and going in
Let you see such a freak in me I hope this never leak on TMZ
This is 50 World Star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis
Im yo director filming you for practice
And you know I think you a hell of a actress
Especially when Im shooting you on a mattress
Shawty straight to the top thats where we headed
And Imma see my name in the credits
