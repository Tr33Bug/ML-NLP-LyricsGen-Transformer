The F scale is used to describe the intensity of tornadoes or twisters and the damage they cause
Categories F0 through F4 describe damage ranging from light to devastating
However category F5 describes total damage
Framed homes are lifted from their foundations
And carried hundreds of miles to disintegrate
Automobiles fly through the air like missiles trees are debunked
Reinforced concrete structures are destroyed incredible phenomenon
And a whole lot of fucked up shit will occur for example
Yeah of course
Okay okay
Its safe to say that I walk a fine line between good and evil
This is a fine time
For me to be trying to explain whats going on inside my mind
Nigga I dont see no other kind of solution
To let these problems loose
Therapeutic the music is sort of a masseuse
To massage my mental so I wont lose it
Sometimes I cant help myself myself got a mind of its own
Buk cannot accept this Jeff
And then Jeff want Buk to die and be gone
Both supposed to be occupyin the same time and the same space
But no just me goin out of my sane mind
They dont really know how I feel
What the fuck is wrong with the muhfucka
Twista is the nigga off of a pill
Is he off of wet Is he off of syrup
Something deep with Formula 44 of Benadryl
Cause a nigga finna kill
Misunderstood cause Im passin whatever disaster
Its not cause Im blasphemous
I leave a nigga body bloody like
Passions of Christ with a mask and a knife
Go blast with the mic
If His prophecy the first shall be last
Then I am the future you are a primitive
Morphism a scorpion these shoes are venomous
The new artillerist
And you dont really wanna start from Genesis
And you dont really wanna spark the nemesis
Get loose if its a crucifix I put you on it for murder boy
You dont wanna bring darkness into this
Yeah all those that relate then you can feel my pain
Tryna walk straight away from the hatred
That I hold deep down inside quiet
I wait I never talk shit about a nigga biz
Cause a niggas his and besides that
I aint no fuckin kid you bitch
You really know it coulda done and been some shit
There could have been a minutes
Thats we really could of plenty through
But all of this bitchin cleanin shit
Sevenhundred million in the plastic
I just consider it all as destiny
Manifestin itself no fin to shit
Steppin over holes watching my steps
You dont know what I been through bitch


Yet I get money like Im Pitbull rich
Then when I hear an instrumental I get into it
Feel a mental glitch
Then I gotta cut a motherfucker like a Ginsu bitch
After that Im nothing be held to love
Especially if I feel with Beelzebub
Instead of the Holy Divine I be outta my mind
And I would detail a thug
Im a misunderstood nigga  Tell em why
Cause Im kind of like Kurt Cobain
An expert on pain you fear it I got lyrics
And a pistol thatll hurt your brain
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga  Tell em why
Cause Im kind of like Tyler Durden
I can fuck a nigga up as  my body with flames
And never feel the fire hurt me
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga 
Like I would be only black aint walk too weak
What I do for the hood is for the good OG swag nigga
Dont talk when I speak
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga 
King Neal Willy Lloyd and Angelo Roberts
When it come to a flow you think your man go hard
But shit this manll go harder
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga 
Im about to fuck shit up
Got me rippin through your body like a natural disaster
Moving like a torpedo with the speed and the vengeance of a killer
If you looking for a murderer Im the master motherfucker
Im about to tear shit up
With heat from a thermometer
Go get your momma to pay for the burial
Im an astonishing interplanetary
Devouring everything from Earth to Andromeda they feelin me
Cause Im about to fuck shit up
Like Freddy after Jason with a fascination for a laceration
And congratulations for eradication
Because I know aint no vaccination for decapitation
At a rapper pacing Im about to tear shit up
Because I take hits with that purple like I am a Viking
Call me lyricalution
I run with a mob of wolves like I am a lycan
Some off the top some I am writin
And if you aint strapped iron we fightin
Cant rock by me runnin through the middle of the field
With that white like I am a titan
Niggas never know what Twista be on
Low key nigga fuckin with a bitch from the hood
I insist that I talk to the psycho psychiatrist
Cause Im misunderstood
Doctor Im problematic tryna withdraw from always lawlessly Resolvin all of my static cause I know God is calling me
But not to come home yet
Basically about the own set
Of blessings from the seeds that Ive sown
Some yet might not be up on yet
But any anyhow niggas tryna pin me down
With bullshit Ill try to keep it moving
Until they fuck up and I distribute the blaow
Cause Im bound by law pure Chicago crown by the bosses
On Scuva Streets my project window down town office
All I want is my music my money my muhfuckin
Shit to be viewed among the elite not to sleep I was thuggin
Im just a good nigga up to no good nigga
Suburbs to the hood I wish you fuckin would nigga
Im a misunderstood nigga  Tell em why
Cause Im kind of like Kurt Cobain
An expert on pain you fear it I got lyrics
And a pistol thatll hurt your brain
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga  Tell em why
Cause Im kind of like Tyler Durden
I can fuck a nigga up as  my body with flames
And never feel the fire hurt me
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga 
Like I would be only black aint walk too weak
What I do for the hood is for the good OG swag nigga
Dont talk when I speak
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga 
King Neal Willy Lloyd and Angelo Roberts
When it come to a flow you think your man go hard
But shit this manll go harder
Because Im a  misunderstood nigga
