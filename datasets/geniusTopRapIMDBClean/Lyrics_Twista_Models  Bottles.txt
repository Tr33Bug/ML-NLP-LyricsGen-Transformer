Drinks up in the air
To the sky aint tellin what going on tonight
Drinks up in the air
For the realest nigga livin tonight
Damn keys they goin
They wont turn up
Know all them bad bitches they love me
Well them drinks is on us
They all cant help it
Models actresses and bottles
Bro chillin with my niggas
Models actresses and bottles
Its a celebration bitches
Throw em up if youre a mission
Put your hands in the air
Wave em like you just dont care
You went from rags to riches and I get it cause you on
Partyin like you aint never had nothin
Middle fingers in the sky for the haters
You aint never really been up on my level so dont try to holla
When you see me ridin out of Vegas whew
Cause I be poppin the bottles because Ill be able
Just look at my table
Theres nothin but models and nothin but dollars
Lookin at momma
She wanna holla she wanna follow she wanna swallow whew
After the fee fee
I got insta plans she wanna see me
I gain insta fans when I be me
Im on Instagram in a GT
What Thats right
Imma fuck with her for the night
I dont give a fuck what you like
Im up in the club but Im right
Let her know that we are the family
We on the pedigree we are celebrities
And you know Im smokin weed and Im ready
Like I be at the Grammys the party is heavy
And I got the fetti
And Im off a Xanny and she got the panties
Drinks up in the air
To the sky aint tellin what going on tonight
Drinks up in the air
For the realest nigga livin tonight
Damn keys they goin
They wont turn up
Know all them bad bitches they love me
Well them drinks is on us
They all cant help it
Models actresses and bottles
Bro chillin with my niggas
Models actresses and bottles
Okay I walk up in the club I be fresh to death
All black dressed to kill
Bumpin on my hip Baby thats the steel
Bitches so I keep that concealed
And that 45 got a lotta kickback
When it go clickclack
Make a nigga get back
Shawty in the red dress make her ass clap
Take her to the back cause Im tryna hit that
Lil chick wanna be a model ay
Took her to the back made her swallow
And I just bought 20 bottles
The Ros got me goin full throttle
She know a young nigga got a check check check
Condos sittin on my neck neck neck
25 racks sittin in my right pocket
Some tight jeans Bibby cant dress like that
Wherever we go hoes follow
I go be with killers and robbers
40 filled up them hollows
We gon clap like Apollo
On and on cant help it
All of these bitches I share em
All of my niggas is thugs
Drinks up in the air
To the sky aint tellin what going on tonight
Drinks up in the air
For the realest nigga livin tonight
Damn keys they goin
They wont turn up
Know all them bad bitches they love me
Well them drinks is on us
They all cant help it
Models actresses and bottles
Bro chillin with my niggas
Models actresses and bottles
