Shit niggas got me higher than a motherfucker off up in here man
Damn the fuck yall get this weed from
Motherfucker overdose or some shit off this shit god damn
Check this shit out though
Now pussy player haters say that Im too raw with it
But yall thinking cause I be talking shit
Them hoes say that nigga cold as hell
Fuck what the punks are talking bout
I want to get up with that big baller bitch
Plus niggas feeling what Im on as well
Blunts got my mind in the zone
The one thats rocking fresh Pelle Pelles
True to the shine on his bone
Somebody beating up the block on fresh rider rims
If its me hell you can tell by the design on the chrome
Crying on the phone
Ho thinking Im in love with her
Cause she took me shopping and had me trying on cologne
So I left her on the line with the tone
Got up with this other bitch
Brought no weed cause she firing up her own
So hurry with the Phillie bitch Im really sick
Off of some illy shit
Here go a rusty razor blade but still it split
And fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip
Its like the bud was tailor made for milliclips
And MAC 10s I lit the B from the back end
Straight to the chest and it got me sprung
My lungs started collapsing shit nigga whats happening
The sess got me tripping off the drums and guns ready for action
Duck and swing or either up a thang
Try to be tougher bang scuff and hang
Suffer pain left deranged then yous a bogus muhfucker man
Since the B struck a vein Im too strange
For muhfuckers to compete with
Im on some infrared heat shit
With a deep clique what I eat sleep shit
Well if its a freak bitch she can suck a sweet dick
Til shes seasick blocking niggas out like an eclipse
When smoking them devils put your hands together
Like you know the host
Cause aint no nigga that can resist the words from the Twist
Leaving niggas comatose from my overdose
I done put the fuel on it take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all yall off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making Gs catch you off on your knees
And snatching fees now that Im up in this game
I done put the fuel on it take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all yall off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making Gs catch you off on your knees
Niggas rolling me Bs just so they can hang
Can you figure out the cause and effect
Niggas coming on your set
Thugs coming out they drawers with a TEC
Victim bleeding from the neck
Shirts is getting wet shorties yelling threats
Looking for the one who called for the deck
Now they airing out the hall in the spot
Hitting stomachs leaving niggas pinched up
Bodies balled in a knot
Bullet holes in the wall from a Glock
Searching for the one who called in the shots
Hypes crawling for rocks
Going all in the socks of the recently deceased
From what was released
From the chrome beast to the dome piece
Visions in my mind being increased by inner beef
With some grief but when I chief on some strong leaf
Im snapping hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief
Violate him but cant annihilate him
Picking up his own teeth and its on with the microphone deep
Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him
Nerves still jumping cause adrenaline pumping is a motherfucker
Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers
Murdered by budlovers making sure every one of you ho studs suck us
And I bullshit you not if it was full clips two Glocks
You would still die or youll get too hot
Cause when my fuel kick youll drop
Hypes is tricking on you
Tell me where he at bitch and youll get two rocks
Cause when my tool click youll pop
Cant this hype nigga stop shit Im hazardous
Making musical miracles like Im Jesus of Nazareth
Yet disastrous smoking on halves and hash fuck if its cancerous
Bust ass simply because I mastered this
Its hard to breathe Im busting like an ABomb
Cause Im in the zone twentytwo a cold shit up my sleeve
Its hard to stay calm thinking about the bitches that Im finna bone
Hitting my enemies and competition up with lethal blows
Thats damaging flows thats callous and were leaving
Thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panicking
I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handling
Now its possible motherfuckers could start vanishing
Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty and stinking from stress
And flowing over notes them studs thinking they can get close
I know I got you tripping off the shit
A nigga said off a overdose


I done put the fuel on it take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all yall off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making Gs catch you off on your knees
And snatching fees now that Im up in this game
I done put the fuel on it take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all yall off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making Gs catch you off on your knees
Niggas rolling me Bs just so they can hang
Cmon and toke on a dub with me I love cities with parties
Thats full of bitches where they let me rub titties
Be able to pack a snub with me in case we get in some static
And gotta start leaking blood from stud skinnies
So dont ask if its the bud in me because for some reason
I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw
It cant be nickel or soft the way its choking me
Potencyll have me rocking mics
And giving your bitch dick in the jaw Im hooking the law
Youre looking in awe took what you saw
Got the Bs pen and pad out the bottom drawer
Then got to biting and formulating some shit you called your own
But take it to the rehab cause you got a flaw
To put it simple you aint cold enough
Tripping out like you cant control the stuff
Lacking rhythm like you known to bust
In a different zone from us
You niggas need to sit the fuck down
Get a swisher and roll this up
If you think Im speaking too bold whats up
I aint even on no ho shit plus the mob is so thick
Im the type of nigga you shouldnt want to get up close to
And take a smoke with
If theres static then check yo clique my mind is so sick
I be tweaking with speaking releasing energy to show I know the ropes
Cause when it comes to this rap shit
Niggas will choke til Im ghost
While I breath reefer smoke from my overdose
Try to put me to the test give me some Buddha bless
Ill show you who the best
Release the vocal trilogy
Alright T god damn slow it up man
Motherfuckers done felt you man we can go to the next shit
God damn man you stopping motherfuckers and shit
Man Im trying to get my zone on
Let niggas hear what the fuck Im doing man
I mean you done zoned man lets go to the next cut baby
Man fuck that shit
