Runnin
My lyrics are cunnin vocabulary is stunnin son of a gun and
Im ranking at one making it fun and taking my gun and loading
Exploding causing harm popping and dropping a bomb
Breaking it down like Imam so be calm cause see Im
The capable no mistakable making the unbreakable breakable
Able to hook em like cable cause Sinister Def aint stable
No deceiving and weaving a web I be leaving a stain in your brain and busting your vein
Picking and kicking a style I be licking and shaking and baking and making it rain
Simple and plain I smoke em like hickory dickory dock its time to clock
So brothers I mop the bigger they drop so stop Tung Twista pop
Gotta be that it be lyrical hiphop
Rocking a rhythm Imma stopdrop Im gonna give em a pop
Flowing this up and breaking the suckers up off of the mic and then rip it to shreds
I be kicking and making the people come off in a rage
And my lyrical magic Im making and moving I label this funky
Oh this dope rhythm I throw be pumppumppumping em up in the mind
And be bringing em up into hypeness
This funky tempo I throw I know that I be slapping the dope hypeness up in em
And then Imma bend em a lyrical rhythm
I throw with the tongue be leaving em hung among
This style I be throwing to tangle the mind of a sucker
Then label it lyricalism and scoping em in a prism
And giving a lyrical flow thatll fizz em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up only my lyric was left
My Tung Twista is def first let me take a deep breath
Flowing the lyrical magic of mine I be mopping and sweeping
And breakin em up and then makin em break in a sweat
I be makin em jump and then sit up and lift the style
I be kicking and popping the rhythm Im rocking and pumping
The lyrics I put up inside em be making em rock
And a flow of the rhythm Im bringing into the mic
Im gonna give em a concept never let a con step
To what I be giving the crowd that be making em hype and then leaving a con swept
Breaking the suckers up into chunks I be leaving em sinking deeper than south
Im gonna twist this up funky TT be runnin off at the mouth
Indeed 
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Listen to the tongue twist twisting is the Tung
Because of my trickery my tongue is slippery
This style is wild I brung
Terrible tragical mystical magical wreck in a second
The ladies Im checking and trickin
You think that Im sickenin hoes be kickin in when I stick it in
I got the enemy jumping like Jiminy like it was ten of me
Try to be friend of me sucking my simile
If Im ill then give me the remedy
Im baking like Daxon waxin giving em facts just like a lawyer
Cause Sinister Def be runnin off at the mouth like Latoya
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Come again
Here I be coming a radical phenomenon fillimeter
Be making a magical matter be that I be
Ratatattat come flow with my tongue energy I
Crush them them cant overcome the power to hum
And then breaking the minimum competitor G
Miracle metamorphosis is breaking em off in this
Lyrical matter becoming a rhythmous venomous pop quiz
Im rocking this as of his and cracking em up with a plop fizz
Lyrical wiz never a wannabe gonna be ripping em up into particles
Then Imma come in the pitiful puppets mind
Seeking a rhythm and you shall find
Rocking the funk of the rhythm me stamina cramming em up in a Tline
Be divine me lyrical purrrrfection a funky feline
Capping a crowd with the mic and then making em mangle
Pumping a fist they tangle
Lyrics so funky even Bojangles
Leaving angels spinnin my tongue
And if you never coming to cheer me I say cheerio hero
Me rhythm will float like a boat lets see how he flow
My freedom of speech Imma reach up against your lyrical flowing a styler
Jamming and dropping a rhythm and popping em up with the funk of a wilder
Holy sorcerer oughta come get with the funk of a slow solo
Bolo wanna throw but I show that a funky pro go still wanna flow Oh no
Sloow ohoh I step when sending men deeper than south
Lyrical Sinister Def and TT we be G running off the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth
