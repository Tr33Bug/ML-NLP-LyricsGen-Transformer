Now Kanye I know I told you to slow it down baby
And its good its all good its beautiful its beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please Do it faster baby do it faster
Damn baby I cant do it that fast
But I know somebody who can Twista
Got you looking at the gliss on my hands and wrists
While Im laying back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you aint no messin with Kanman and Twist
In the Chi and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some RB while I smoke a B
You can preferably find that Im a G
And all is  Well well well well 
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You aint know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light movin to some Isleys
His rims still moving so I bump a little Spinners
While Im smoking on a B dipping through the streets
Bumping RB and I got the heat on them 23s
And I do it  Well well well well 
With my Earth in the Wind smokin Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation slowjamming having deep sex
You Ready for the World girl Come on go with me
Ill touch you all over your body baby dont say no to me
And every notell be controlling me
Im loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of Roll It Slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast but Imma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like its RB go to the club with me
And with some Luther come on
I hope you feelin me and still gon be in love with me Chi ride
She say she want some Marvin Gaye some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
Are you gonna be are you gonna be are you gonna be
Are you gonna be are you gonna be well well well well 
She say she want some Ready For The World some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
Yes it well oh yes it will
Are you gonna be are you gonna be are you gonna be
Are you gonna be are you gonna be well well well well 
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man you gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that then I take it to the dome
Then I got to bone stay up in the zone
Got to get you home gotta run up on
And I do it  well well well well 
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man you gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that then I take you to my home
We can get it on disconnect the phone
Trying to get you gone Imma make you moan
And Ill do it  Well well well well
