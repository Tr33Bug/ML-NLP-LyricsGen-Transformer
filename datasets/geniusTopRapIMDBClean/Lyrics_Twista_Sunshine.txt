When I wake up in the morning love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning love
Bears heavy on my mind
Lets get them dollars lets get this money
Yyeah keep my mind on my
I keep my mind on my money money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigger stayin on the grind
Now when I wake up in the mornin I gots to hit a lick
Saw the 2003 Navi on Spres with a kick
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin the block and dodgin the one time
Peep how we movin them rocks
And the pounds of dro before I double my shit
I can serve 16 ounces for 6 and get back 96
A killer for the scrilla nigga best not be stalkin
I gots to get them bigger figures fuck what you talkin
I represent the niggas ballin with jewelry full of sickles
Down to the niggas chasin million the dream servin nickels
And I know one day Im gon come up
And when you see me dont hate that I rolled up
Get paid whether you legit when you slang or tippin off caine
Until I take a dip in the Range Im flippin them thangs
Gotta get some money mayn
Its a lovely day just got paid
Stack it up be on my way
A lovely day lovely day lovely day
Its a lovely day just got paid
Stack it up be on my way
A lovely day lovely day lovely day
A hustlers definition is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker you serve him for that
Im makin money off of verses when I spit em on tracks
And if I aint sellin no records Im servin them packs
I got a clip full of hollows moneymakins my motto
Semiauto and Marlboros in the bottle til I hit the lotto
With dreams of ownin a record label flippin words
My nigga flippin buildings better than he was flippin birds
I got the mentality and the motive Im on a mission
For the money you can get it too its all about yo ambition
Play yo position provide the plans and follow procedures
Into the 600 blunted with a pocket full of hundreds and Visas
Love when I get that dust hit em up recock then I get back up
Love when I get that gig get a crib
Get a car when the grips stack up
And still in the evenin if Im sleepin paper products
Soon as I get up its just another day another dollar
Gotta get that money mayn
Its a lovely day just got paid
Stack it up be on my way
A lovely day lovely day lovely day
Its a lovely day just got paid
Stack it up be on my way
A lovely day lovely day lovely day
Got love for the corporate playas thats ballin rollin Jags
Got love for the thug niggas who get it on the Ave
Love for those who can make a mil and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine strippers who get it poppin ass
Love for the single parents thats workin through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin movin muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the haters rollin bubbles
Causin trouble every time a young brother try to hustle
And if I cant legally make a lot
Then I gotta get right back on the block
And if it aint no work we do a stickup and whip up a concoction
Might leave you face down in the dirt
Because hurtins not an option
Gotta get that money mayn
Its a lovely day just got paid
Stack it up be on my way
A lovely day lovely day lovely day
Its a lovely day just got paid
Stack it up be on my way
A lovely day lovely day lovely day
When I wake up in the morning love ohhohhohh
And the sunlight hurts my eyes ohhohh ohhh
And something without warning love ohhohhohh
Bears heavy on my mind
Its a lovely day just got paid
Stack it up be on my way
A lovely day lovely day lovely day
