Thinkin bout You  Remix  Lyrics
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made it usually doesnt rain
In Southern California much like Arizona
My eyes dont shed tears but boy they pour when Im thinkin bout you
Ooh no no no 
Ive been thinkin bout you  You know know know 
Ive been thinkin bout you
Do you think about me still Do ya do ya
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking bout forever  Oooh oooh 
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking bout forever  Oooh oooh 
Twista the Remix 
Beautiful black woman can you accept me
Im hoping you never forget me
Touch you wrong I never let my hands let me
Feelings for you as deep as my ancestry
Lookin at you black as an Egyptian statue
Elegant in stature got cha all in my mental
When I feel the energy every memory I still try and capture
Rapture Beautiful goddess but modest and almost astonishes everybody else that I let you escape my physical
Form and to be especially cause you were warm I was hoping that we would make a commitment that was biblical
Pivotal situation put us in critical consequences
I feel like it was all senseless Now my pain when Im feelin all defenseless
Cause I shoulda worked harder for you up in the trenches Im a be Frank
Oceans I think about it comparison when I measurein the depth of our love
Theyll be nothin above
Sadder than purple rain memorys got me cryin like a dove
Well do you ever think about it or did you really forget
I dont think I forgot an hour What youd use to look like stepping out the shower
Super sexy when you in a position of power
Spiritual essence of what a real woman is
Lets get in a time machine I call it music
Hoping I can jog every memory you get subliminal takin you back forever the way I use it
How I tell the DJ spin it thoughts about you are usually infinite You on my mind is always authentic
When I think about you I be all up in it


Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking bout forever  Oooh oooh 
No I dont like you I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I dont love you I just thought you were cute
Thats why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet I dont get to fly it though
Im lyin down thinkin bout you
Ooh no no no 
Ive been thinkin bout you
You know know know 
Ive been thinkin bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya do ya
Or do you not think so far ahead  Ahead 
Cause I been thinking bout forever  Oooh oooh 
Or do you not think so far ahead  Ahead 
Cause I been thinking bout forever  Oooh oooh 
Yes of course
I remember how could I forget
How you feel
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It wont ever get old not in my soul
Not in my spirit keep it alive
Well go down this road
Til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead  Ahead 
Cause I been thinking bout forever  Oooh oooh 
Or do you not think so far ahead  Ahead 
Cause I been thinking bout forever  Oooh oooh
