Chris Millionaire on the track
In the club throwin money
Turned up Kells and the Twista
The way she work it on the pole
Got me throwin my money throwin my money
They way she twerk it on the pole
Got me throwin my money throwin my money
The way she pop it on the pole
Got me throwin my money throwin my money
The way she slide down on the pole
Got me throwin my money throwin my money
Pop that booty let me watch it girl
Drop it Ill not knock it  better yet Imma reach into my pocket girl
Watch it girl she sluggin come over here cause I see what you do
Tippin off the plenty booze how you be attractin plenty dudes with the Jimmy Choo shoes you in
What you doing takes some talent so I gotta say that Im enjoying what I witness
My money flow is endless lookin at her work that pole like a gymnast
Climbin up to the top turn it upside down then open up her legs
Lookin sexy all the way to the bottom Im throwin dollars cause it look like she finna hit her head
Now she twerlin around it then do a split right in front of it
Ready to go back up when she look at how thick the money get
She do it caterpillar ballerina diamond toes arial and vert
Full rockin it verti crucifix fan kick pro pound with mills stacks spin in reverse
I aint got no plans tonight
Get somewhere you can help me get my head right
And I love your swag cause its just like mine
Siamese twins me and you we two of a kind
Strip club is our playground she playing on her monkey bar
Up and down like a roller coaster  I call that ass a theme park
Way she handle her business from the sky she make it drop
My money no limit tonight Im about to go astronaut
Never ride solo Mr Franklin always with me
Shed been around the pole so many times she should be dizzy
Rolex thats real crime these niggas exaggerating
Her ass can hold a glass thats no exaggerating
