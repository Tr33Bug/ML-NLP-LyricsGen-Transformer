With a 97 pimp flow got a feelin
When you smokin when I flip it to a Trax beat
Talkin about a beautiful figure astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like the girl in uhh whats that movie
Never mind let me enter yo atmosphere
As you enter my world and let me touch that booty
I cant believe that yo momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul you need a modelin role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin
From the bottom to the top of the pole cause you can pop in control

But when Im not for the feminine  feminine 
And everybody that proceed with the hatred Imma teach em a lesson

Cause thats the way I receive immunization against the recession
I got the muscle off of my hustleandflow money
A entrepreneur with ways to get mo money
So dont be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Huh its just a lil bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet in other ways
Then Imma have to beat it up but first Imma play witchu girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play witcha pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play witcha pearl
When I lay you down you aint gotta be frontin and fakin on me baby
Cause I know it take the right touch
I aint stoppin til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited I cant hold it
Im feelin it comin Im bout to let off an explosion  ohh 
Let it ride when I see you animated and shakin
Now when I touch your body you catchin convulsions  uhhuh 
Thats when I know Im doin what Im supposed to
