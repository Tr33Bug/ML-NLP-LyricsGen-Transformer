What Somebody told me Whitney Houston died
Cant believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes
She was gettin better now its really just blew aside
I still aint got over Don Cornelius suicide
So where do I start it Dearly departed
One of Heavens angels for sure who was really an artist
Lovin the way that my mama would say she could sing and the way it was magical
Aint nobody like you nobody before you and nobody after you
Could ever come near it not here in the flesh but you with us in spirit
So sad to hear it Im choking up while I come up with these lyrics
And though she blessed the Earth and its time to let Heaven prosper
I still wish somebody was there to protect her  Who  Kevin Costner
Who  Clive Davis  Who  Bobby Brown
Her mama and her daughter Whitney is where God be now
Such a short time dont want it to be this way
But if she was here she would probably say
If I should stay I would only be in your way
If you wanna say rest in peace to Whitney Houston
I had Traxter leave 16 bars open on this song
So that you could do so with me
So get your verses ready hop on this track with me
Pay a tribute to the late Whitney Houston
