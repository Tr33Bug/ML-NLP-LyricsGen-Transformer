Sometimes I go fast somtimes I just stop
Sometimes I take it slow when I let the sex drop
But most of the time I go quick when Im hittin that shit
And she like it she like it
But tonight she said she didnt want to go too fast
And tonight she said she want me to take my time
So I took her down and said Do you like that and she said Hell yeah
Then hit it medium from the back I said Its cool and she said Hell yeah
She said Ooh baby just take control baby
Long as you take it slow baby then you can hit it all night baby
She gave me the green so I had to go start screaming my name when I went low
And every time I started going real fast she looked at me and said
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light
I told her that I wanted to beat it up fast so lil mama let me know when to go
Tonight she dont want a drill session she wanna feel it so she told me to take it slow
Im so used to mackin it pokin it back to back when Im attackin it I wanna go get in
She blew the whistle like beep be still hold it in now roll it in
She lifted her palms to hold my face because she want me to control my pace
She said she wanna feel it all slide through the windows of the wall cause the feeling was too cold away
Well I can break it down to 50 down to 40 down to 30
In the speed you want me to I can do for you shawty tell me how you want it
Do you want the lambo I give it to you like uh uh uh uh uh when I do it baby
Or do you want the 64 I give it to you like uh uh when I do it baby
Now I was thinkin I was all up in it right but now she got me caught up at the light I try to call it like
Green uh uh too fast red uh uh too slow she want it in the middle so I gotta
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light
Now with a subtle way to soothe your soul got her lovin the way I move the pole instead of rude and bold
I want her to see what it feel like when a playa break it down into cruise control and still rule the role
Never stuck in only one speed dick shift in the stick shift I am not them dudes
Its not a jack rabbit when I be tappin it I wanna slow it up and give it to her chopped and screwed
Come here shawty and let me knock them shoes feel it sensual when I rock to the groove
Make it hot then cool if you think you butter show her how to stutter step stop then move
But I get not the order narray canary and my flow is like a shop of horror
Scaryin berries whenever I rock with the R Kelly in every position for power we slaughter
Im petty like veli Im getting money cause I oughta
I tell the girl to slow down lil mama cause you aint gotta be so anxious
Going rapidly when you flex yo thighs its still good sex if your exercise your patience
We aint gotta do it like we racin cause all the time that aint how I like it
Green uh uh too fast red uh uh too slow Im on the mid level so she gotta
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light
