Now when I touch on yo body babe
And when I grab on yo body babe
When I feel on yo body babe
I say ooh oooh oooh  Hell yeah 
Can I reintroduce myself
For the city of the Chi West side aint it mayne
Put some flame to the maryjane
Down with the same thang
With main in the left lane peep game
Put the duck in the ash tray got on the freeway
Sprayed a lil cologne on the car seats
Then I gotta up wit big d and six freaks
They was thick as hell you understand me
I was sipping on Patron about to fade out
Got up wit lil ma had the whole lick layed out
Put the gucci on the doorseat
Countin some mo gees the dice game damn near broke me
So Im callin fo mo geess and putting a pound of weed and four bs
My thumper and my door keys
Walked up like she know me I gotta keep it moving
Cause she prolly be the police

Bumped out wit the same hoes tonight we in the hotel

Yo ass and yo titties

What id do what id do

To be a cold mothafucka with the fes and the lads
Now let the roof all down
While Im gettin good ol head smoking trees in the back
You see the mix with the jewels and the stacks
Dont try to pull it I got goons wit the gats
My money long like a python
Makes yo bitch say fuck it Imma roll wit the mack

Blow gettin all that show and my meat gon touch the floor

Gurl you got a banging body like a Bugatti
She got work like a cooking pot  oh 
She got legs like a potential hit  yes 
And a frame like a working car
But who the one the women looking spectacular fo
Who the one that got the bump in the back of the truck
Who the one that saw the body wit the booty of a Maserati
While Im in the party way back in the club
You be kinda reminding me of my gee princess
So I gotta say majesty when I say that
And when I see the way the fatty looking from way back
You be kinda reminding me of a Maybach
You be the type I know I mite kiss
And if I flow it right I know Im so righteous
And if you wanna try and get as lyrical like the twist
You gotta flow lililili like this
So now ima go to the back
Get a cup fill it up wit the drink when I mack on a ho
Triple it up when I get up Im on a cut
cause I be Twist and Ima kick that spectacular flow
How I spit you know it got the glory
Though its kinda gory when I come out of the lavatory lets ride

If you was a car girl youd be a phantom
Yo ass and yo titties

And when I grab on yo body babe
I say oooh oooh  Hell yeah
