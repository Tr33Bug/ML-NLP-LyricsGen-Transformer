A Message from Yasiin Bey  Lyrics
Peace this is Yasiin
No more parties in SA
Please tell em no more parties in SA
Aint home arrest I dont need to stay
Ill leave and Ill stay away
I committed no crime any place
Why these police up in my face
Why they raiding my place
Why I dont feel safe
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
My intentions are pure in coming here
And thats for everything I love or hold dear
Umis in the building
So is my wife and my children
I committed no crime
Why is the state wasting my time
They must be out of their minds
I forgive em thats the spirit of divine
I just wanna go where Im wanted
Where Im loved stop frontin
Where I live is my choice you cannot mute my voice
Thank you Kanye West for being a real friend a real friend
A real friend
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SA
I heard your choice the first time Ill go away
And when I leave thats exactly where Ill stay
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
A country called Earth everywhere
A country called Earth everywhere
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SAThats just a freestyle I had to let that out Peace to all fear none this is Yasiin Bey At this present time I am currently in Cape Town South Africa and Im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason Theyre saying that they want to deport my family Uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious which it is not Anyone can do the research about the world passport its not a fictitious document It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all In fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015 You can see the stamps theyre there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate To quote Lil Durk I am not a liar Ive made no false claims I have not misrepresented myself Im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way Im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also umIts curious I havent broken any law and Im being treated like a criminal I know Im not unique in that regard and I am grateful that Im here with my family I havent been physically harmed or anything like that However I have been detained People in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily Theres no reason I have to spend any time in the cell Theres no reason I had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all This is not an administration of justice and all I seek is to leave the state Im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because Im not I just wanna go home and I dont live in America and I have the right to domicile wherever I please without fear or without interference
The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily And thats fine we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either My family and I are prepared immediately to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state never to return to this state again We dont have to be here Were not pining to be here and were complying in every possible way reasonably Just today state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family and they had no right to do so I have legal representation here who they could easily contact Theyre contravening and breaking all types of international law and its untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on And I know its been a lot of chatter about whats going on you know people are running to the press because thats justyou know a money making machine So its another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera some telenovella and I have no interest in it Furthermore related but not directly related to this Im retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today and also from Hollywood effective immediately I am releasing my final album this year Umand thats that
Peace to all fear of none Thank everyone for their time Much success to you even if you wish me the opposite as Nas said And Im on the side of the right so people could wish however they want but I aint nobodysI aint no threat or a hazard to nobody I really try to mind my business What people think about me is none of my business and Im not here to change peoples opinions about me You dont have to like me you dont have to like everything that I say The fact is is that I have hurt no one I have injured no parties and all I require as is my lawful right is innocent passage to my domicile That is all
In summary I will say this I will close with a simple prayer To the one who has created the all you know me better than I know myself and I know myself better than people know me So forgive me for whatever they know or do not know Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said Ameen ameen allahumma ameen
And Ill close for you Ye with the with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori And and shout out to Madlib and Otis andandand Michael and his entire family and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in LA I wish you and your family the best your mother you know reach out to me Egon you know yall know how to reach Shout out to Corey Smyth shout out to my brother Talib Kweli salaam to my brother Kamaal Fareed Ali Shaheed Muhammad Islam all of the Zulu Nation The Zulu Nation real here theres real Zulus My brother Siyabonga the Madlalas All of the people here who have supported me this is no reflection on you I love the people of this country I love this continent I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state They waste enough of my time and Im through with you Felicia were through I dont want nothing from you You can keep the records the sweatshirts everything its no problem But Ill end with this verse that I wanna put on No More Parties in LA if you would kindly allow me my dear brother Kanye And shout out to K Lamar too I see you my dudeLonely America crazy America
Loud ass country ass cocaine America
Lethal America carcinogen asthma
Carbonated smoke throughout your blood plasma
Lights and camera action surveillance
Helicopters teleprompters
Flossy newscasters rich fool bastards
War migrant workers cold murder traffic
Welcome to Los stop right there
Biggie got shot right here
Angeles
Hollywood hoes handguns
Peace to all fear none This is Bey Love One
