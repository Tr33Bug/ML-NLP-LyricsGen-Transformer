Yo
The way I feel  sometimes its too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill mellow down blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the street the people breathe without hope
They goin through the motion they dimmin down the focus
The focus get cleared then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes yall dont hear me
I push it past the bass know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones black
Im so wide awake that Im hardly ever sleep
My flow forever deep
And its volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
Im everywhere  penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life  holla black you know it well
Quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force high low or right across
Soul is the lions roar voice is the siren
I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous theres no need for fightin
Suckers tryin to hide like the struggle wont find em
Then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind em
Its everywhere  Penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life  holla black you know it well
