Beauty In The Dark Lyrics (Isley Brothers)
And ya know
Yes you know
Yes you know
My name Black Dante
I cannot resist when you pass my way
Your name Beauty In The Dark
I'm staring through the fog trying to find where you are
You got to take my hand
You got to at least give me this one chance
I've been waiting all night
Don't be cruel girl it's only right
I've been watching and waiting
All night long
And now they're playing this song
And ya know
And ya know
(I've been wanting to know)
You got to take my hand
(Girl, speak yo' mind)
And give me this one chance
(Been thinking all of this time)
I can see it in your eye
(What I wouldn't do)
And baby I don't mind
(Oooh I)
It's a beautiful thing
Especially when we can rock and swing
When you're in my arms
I'm smelling your hair and I'm feeling on your charms
Baby please come close
Don't let me go
Baby hold me tight
We can rock like this all night
I've been watching and waiting
All night long (so long)
And know they're playing this song
Oh baby baby
(And you know, you know)

I cannot resist when you come my way
Your name Beauty In The Dark
I'm staring through the fog trying to find where you are
You got to take my hand
And baby at least give me this one dance
My name Black Dante
(I've been watching, I've been watching)
You are the Beauty In The Dark
You got to take my hand
And baby baby please give me just one chance
My name Black Dante
I cannot resist when you pass my way
(I wanna groove)
Your name Beauty In The Dark
I'm staring through the fog trying to find where you are
(I wanna groove)
You got to take my hand
And baby baby please give me just one chance
I swear I do, I swear I do, I swear I do
My name Black Dante
(I've been thinking, you've been thinking, thinking of me)
You are the Beauty In The Dark
(I wanna groove)
You gotta take my hand
And baby baby please give me this one chance2Embed
