Isley Brothers 
And ya know
Yes you know
Yes you know
My name Black Dante
I cannot resist when you pass my way
Your name Beauty In The Dark
Im staring through the fog trying to find where you are
You got to take my hand
You got to at least give me this one chance
Ive been waiting all night
Dont be cruel girl its only right
Ive been watching and waiting
All night long
And now theyre playing this song
And ya know
And ya know
Ive been wanting to know 
You got to take my hand
Girl speak yo mind 
And give me this one chance
Been thinking all of this time 
I can see it in your eye
What I wouldnt do 
And baby I dont mind
Oooh I 
Its a beautiful thing
Especially when we can rock and swing
When youre in my arms
Im smelling your hair and Im feeling on your charms
Baby please come close
Dont let me go
Baby hold me tight
We can rock like this all night
Ive been watching and waiting
All night long  so long 
And know theyre playing this song
Oh baby baby
And you know you know 
My name Black Dante
I cannot resist when you come my way
Your name Beauty In The Dark
Im staring through the fog trying to find where you are
You got to take my hand
And baby at least give me this one dance
My name Black Dante
Ive been watching Ive been watching 
You are the Beauty In The Dark
You got to take my hand
And baby baby please give me just one chance

Your name Beauty In The Dark
