Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when the working folks cant find jobs
So they trying to find niggas to rob
Trying to find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack babies cant find moms
Cause they in a pine box or locked behind bars
Beef aint the summer jam for Hot 97
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef dont come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin you defendant
Beef It come with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
To tell you that she pregnant by some other nigga
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home but youre too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doing is getting bigger
Youre trying not to raise em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got your seed in her
A manicure handout like Pay me nigga
Or Im telling your wife
Or starting up some foul rumor thatll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangsta aint doing it right
And other gangstas is deciding what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Beef is what Ja said to 50
But beef is all my homies not being here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is trying to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what yall call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happening every day
And its realer than them songs you gave to Kayslay
This has been a real niggas PSA
From Mos Def pretty flaco
Black Dante
And the Black Star Embassy B to the K
