Hey hey ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I dont have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe Im on fire hey
Cause its the BtheRtheOtheOK
LYN is the place where I stay
The BtheRtheOtheOK
Best in the world and all USA
Its the BtotheRtheOtheOK
LYN is the place where I stay
The BtotheRtheOtheOK
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on BedStuy when I was spry and young
I used to try and come to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod say a little something
When I was just a youngin before the days of thuggin
How me and Charlie Chims yo what Im only bugging
Fast forward nine now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at Gods speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time round the nine to five
For as long as Im alive paw I got to strive
I aint sittin roadside that aint part of the plan
Im out here for my fam doin all that I can
I love my city sweet and gritty inland to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we prone to outburst
Philosophy redefine us touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
Im from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This aint a game clown play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want Jack Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest first hardest Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the Dutch many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go


Good morning Vietnam
We live in Brooklyn baby X2 
Yo sometimes I sit back reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap push your wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Fulton and Jay got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it form partnership
Increase armament street pharmacist
Deep consequence when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught rode the white horse and cant get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
Its real yo but still yo its love here
And its felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident deeper sentiment
They shout out Go Brooklyn they representing it
Sitting on their front stoop sipping Guinnesss
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom and Pop local shop businesses
Travel all around the world in great distances
And aint a place that I know that bear resemblance
Thats why we call it The Planet
Not a borough or a province its our style thats uncommon
From Sumner to Tompkins to Lafayette Gardens
Wyckoff Gowanus in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya going wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The 90s and all my yarda trini Browns Village
Parkside tennis courts thirties forties and the fifties
The cats out in Starrett City getting busy
To the Hook to the East to the Stuy
Bushwick and Canarsie
Farragut Fort Greene and Marcy
My Flatbush posse generals of armies
When its time to form just call me
And let this song be playin loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly
Raise it up
Brooklyn my habitat the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at thugs draw they hammer back
Its where you find the News Two crew cameras at
Its where my fam is at summertime jam is at
They play BIG and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax hustlin you cant relax
The crack babies tryin to find where they mamas at
Its off the handle black with big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot lo gear is at
The stompin grounds where you find a pound of smoke is at
Be blazin John that have your wave cap floatin back
The doorstep where the disposessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin Zovirax
You big balling better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that its over black
Brooklyn keep on takin it worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MCs was a local cat
