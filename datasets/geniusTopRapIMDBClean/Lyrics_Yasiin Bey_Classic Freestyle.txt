Slim brown skin I be
Standin 510 I be
Rockin it when I be in your vicinity
Raw style synergy
Recognize symmetry
Comps try to injure me
Broke em down chemically
Aint the number ten MC talkin bout how been I be
Styled it like Kennedy
Late like a tentothree
When I say when I be girl say ven aqu
Cause this tend to be
Way out like Tennessee
Take me to a place called the BK
Without pause or delay
Get run like Penn Relay
Dont deal with hesayshesay
Aint workin for no cheap pay
The Mos Def beat play
This what the streets say
Hey Mr DJ play that devil MoGain
That jam got me open
This how the break get broken
From front front side to side middle to back
Never the wack I come from Bedstuy black
From Louis AVE to be exact
Brooklyn Where you at
