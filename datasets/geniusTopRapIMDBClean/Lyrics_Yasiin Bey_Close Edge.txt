Pull up to your spot on low
Shine brighter than all of they cats that got on glow
Lay in the cut like they not gon know
Cause if I gotta make a move dog they not gon know
This door marked private this is not fo show
Its Mos Def what you call real fo sure
Is they what you call gangster hell no
They get a little pinch and go snitch to the po
They all talk fast and they all think slow
Im Mos Definite not think so
Flood your city with the black ink flow
And my crew aint scared to let them things go
So stop with the nonsense like he conscious
Im just awake dog Im doing great dog
I dont play games so I dont playa hate yall
Get it straight or get the fuck up out my face dog
Im like the second plane that made the towers face off
That shit that let you know its really not a game dog
Your grind and my grind aint the same dog
Im the catalogue you the same song
So cool and old school like eightfour
The one your little mami winding up her waist for
The name that real niggas got they hand raised for
Me and Mini got your block yellow taped off
Dont push me cause Im close
To the streets to the beats
The bitches the niggas the women the children
The workers the killers the addicts the dealers
The quiet the livest the realest
And thats close
Dont push me cause Im close
To the edge back middle and front
Strong back shit lifting it up
From the big and the small
Im like J Brown getting involved
And when Im letting off a round dont get in the cross
Have your preacher man speaking low getting his cross
Tell a wild cowboy not to get off they horse
Before they find out the town law is strictly enforced
Its a real bad way to get your name in the Source
Testing the limits of a dangerous force
You ended up dumb famous and gone
Your people shouting out your name in they song
Pouring liquor on the day you was born
Buying paint to put your face on a wall
Cmon fall back theres no need for all that
Its all good we all here going all out
All live all day listen when the song say
Dont push me cause Im close
To the streets to the beats
The bitches the niggas the women the children
The workers the killers the addicts the dealers
The quiet the livest the realest
And thats close
Dont push me cause Im close
To the edge back middle and front
Strong back shit lifting it up
From the big and the small
Im like J Brown getting involved
Now get yours
