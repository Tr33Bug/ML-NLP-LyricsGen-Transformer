Bismillah ir Rahman ir Raheem
If you can hear me ladies and gentlemen
Then Im very happy that you came here
Oohoooh whee

Ha ha we get it every time
You got me on Oh
Shout out to all of my crew EastWest NorthSouth
All the continent Europe all abroad international
Bring it in bring it in bring it in bring it in
Its a lot of things goin on yall
21st century is comin
20th century almost done
A lot of things have changed
A lot of things have not mainly us
We gon get it together right I believe that
Listenpeople be askin me all the time
Yo Mos whats gettin ready to happen with hiphop
Where do you think hiphop is goin 
I tell em You know whats gonna happen with hiphop
Whatevers happening with us
If we smoked out hiphop is gonna be smoked out
If we doin alright hiphop is gonna be doin alright
People talk about hiphop like its some giant livin in the hillside
Comin down to visit the townspeople
We are hiphop
Me you everybody we are hiphop
So hiphop is going where we going
So the next time you ask yourself where hiphop is going
Ask yourself where am I going How am I doing
Till you get a clear idea
So if hiphop is about the people
And the hiphop wont get better until the people get better
Then how do people get better  Hmm 
Well from my understanding people get better
When they start to understand that they are valuable
And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
Or cause somebody think they sexy
But they valuable cause they been created by God
And God makes you valuable
And whether or not you recognize that value is one thing
You got a lot of societies and governments
Tryin to be God wishing that they were God
They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere
And make you think they got the allseeing eye
Eh I guess The Last Poets wasnt too far off
When they said that certain people got a god complex
I believe its true
I dont get phased out by none of that none of that
Helicopters the TV screens the newscasters the satellite dishes
They just wishing
They cant really never do that
When they tell me to fear they law
When they tell me to try to have some fret in my heart behind the things that they do
This is what I think in my mind
And this is what I say to them
And this is what Im saying to you check it
All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels hold a pen keep a record in time
Which is passing and running like a caravan trader
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposing of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh where you at right here
On this place called Earth holding down my square
Bout to do it for yall and yall at the fair
So just bounce come on bounce
Bbbounce bbounce bbouncebounce
And just
Just step two three
Just step two three and
Step two
Two three and
One two three and four
One two three and four
Once again
All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels hold a pen keep a record in time
Which is passing and running like a caravan trader
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposing of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh where you at right here
On this place called Earth holding down my square
Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere
Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere
To your atmosphere to your atmosphere
Ohooh
That was for youand Brooklyn too
