Some cats really like to you know
Profile and front
And then the jooks go down all at once they like
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Youre out on the block hustling at the spot
GOT this is how you get Got
At the gamblin spot and your hand is mad hot
GOT this is how you get Got
Out in Brooklyn late night flashing all of your rocks
GOT this is how you get Got
Some girl from pink house said I like you a lot
GOT this is how you get Got
This one goes to all them Big Will cats
With ice on they limbs and big rims on they Ac
You goin around town with your system bump
And your windows cracked low to profile and front
Now I like to have nice things just like you
But Im from Brooklyn certain shit you just dont do
Like high postin when you far from home
Or like high postin when you all alone
Now this would seem to be clear common sense
But cats be livin off sheer confidence
Like Fuck that picture them tellin me run that
But acting invincible just aint sensible
Its nineteen ninetynow and theres certain individuals
Swear they rollin hard and get robbed on principle
5 star general flashin on your revenue
You takin a ride on the Downstate medical Like  whooooooo 
Colorful sparks yellow and blue
A full on attack and its happening to you
Wit nothing you can do but bust back and cop a plea
But five of them and one of you that equals Got to me


Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Come on yall now lets be real
Some jokers got a rough time keepin it concealed
I wonder what it mean its probably selfesteem
They fiendin to be seen get hemmed like Gabardines
Cats think it cant happen until the gats start clappin
They comin down the wire spittin fire like a dragon
Cause while the goods glisten certain eyes take position
To observe your trickin then catch that ass slippin
Like come on now ock what you expect
Got a months paycheck danglin off your neck
And while you Cristal sippin they rubbin up they mittens
With heat in mint condition to start the gettigettin
They clique starts creepin like Sandinista guerrillas
You screamin playa haters these niggas is playa killers
Mr Fashion that style never last long
The harder you flash the harder you get flashed on
Theres hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
Many steal for sport but more steal to eat
Cats heavy at the weighin and hes playin for keeps
Dont sleep theyll roll up in your passengers seat
There is universal law whether rich or poor
Some say lifes a game to more life is war
So put them egos to the side and get off them head trips
Fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you headless
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
Dont get me dont get me
Dont gggggget me
