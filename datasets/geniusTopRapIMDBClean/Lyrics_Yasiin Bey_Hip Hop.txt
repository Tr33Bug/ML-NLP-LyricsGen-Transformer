You say one for the treble two for the time
Come on yall lets rock this
You say one for the treble two for the time
Come on
Speech is my hammer bang the world into shape
Now let it fall  huh 
My restlessness is my nemesis
Its hard to really chill and sit still committed to page
I write a rhyme sometimes wont finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically addminister subtract the wack
Selector wheel it back Im feeling that
From the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto stay fluid even in staccato  Mos Def 
Full blooded full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow Theres the hum
Young man where you from Brooklyn number one
Native son speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow  there it is 
While you still tryin to find where it is
Im on the Ave where it lives and dies violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the Kings Engalish
But caught a rash on my lips so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the baseline  swish 
Move like an apparition low to the ground with ammunition
Chichipow  Move from the gate voice cued
On your tape putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate who choosing your fate  yo 
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping to BeBopping to HipHopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man got the whole world watching
Where ya at  Im high low east west all over your map
Im getting big props with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock the fairweather friends flock
When your chart position drop then the phone calls
Chill for a minute lets see who else hot snatch your shelf spot
Dont gas yourself akh
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked  rock rock rock rock 
The more emotion I put into it the harder I rock
Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits  hungh  Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline its low life getting treetop high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory a class E felony
Facing the death penalty  hungh 
Stimulant and sedative original repetitive
Violently competitive a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to BBoys getting busy
The wartime snap shot the working mans jackpot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the havenots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops  woooo 
Its allcity like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you praise you pay you
Do whatever you say do but black it cant save you
