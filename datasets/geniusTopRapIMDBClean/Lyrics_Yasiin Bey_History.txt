Kweli say Everybody act according to the season that they born in
Some in the night some in the morning some at noon
Some in winter some in June
Its all cool its the natural
Science is a jewel
For me and mines yours and you
Lets move tell you a little bit about mine yo
I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad feelings pass and change
But they never leave they here to stay
Holiday holiday happy birthday
Teenage love the first cut run deep
Soul on flesh this is the Brooklyn streets
Year of the Ox seven and three
MD the history  come on 
Every soul got one of these  yes 
Its where you been and where you be
And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete the start and the end
Then it just go round again
Again and again brand new
Again and again so fresh
Again and again newness
I was born in the decade of decadence where they worshipped what they have
Ford was president do the math
The war was ended when the North Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like bye we was gone let bygones be bygones
Im gone spread love its the Brooklyn way
Where they hug you with the firearm try it on
Like new school clothes Black Star official
Smash when we do a show its facts no mystery
Im down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with the Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful bigotry at work me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin like a hit chorus
The flow is historic they cant get rid of us
Ubiquitous and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us
And dont call it comeback in particular
We will never blend into ephemera or
Fade into peripheral transmission of the ministers origin
Over broadcast clear without diminishing
Black Star stovetop burning soul temperatures administers
Alkalines aminos and minerals essentials
Served over Dilla time signatures
Its miracle material remember its right now foreverness
