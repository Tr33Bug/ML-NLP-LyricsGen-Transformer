First of all shout and respect to 
Shout and respect to Lupe Fiasco
Shout out to Mr West
Shout out to Rashid Lonnie Lynn
King Louie LEP Bogus
Whole Chicago movement
Real Recognize Real check it
White supremacy is what I dont like
Sugarass crackers what I dont like
The Bank of America I dont like
When they lynch and cynicism yeah I dont like
I dont like I dont like
The way the ghetto living man I dont like
Got us strapped up in the system man I dont like
Aint too different from a prison jacket aint right
Aint no freedom at the trap hustlers everywhere
You could feel it in the air pure despair
Hungry hands only take when they reaching out
Campaign smoking geek up gun pow
Ugly politicians new election year
Crying bout their care they are not sincere
Its the greedy and the rich ones that make war
That the hungry young and poor ones paid for
The little homie stretched out in a coffin
They dying younger and they dying more often
The rent too high the wage too low
The top five stupid songs up on your radio nah
I dont like  I dont like 
All this cackling and caring on I dont like
All this suckaness and scary shit I dont like
All these Africoon Americans it aint right
And that goes to crazyass crackers
Small claim corp clowns and strip club rappers
Out in broad day with they nipples out
With they stretch marks blackheads and pimples out
Yuck you suck go away
Youre always talking and you never got much to say
Yuck you suck go away
Youre always crowding space fix your thirsty face nah
I dont like I dont like
The way your shoulders looking sound I dont like
The way I see em getting down I dont like
Make you wonder how they get around it aint right
In the land where crooks get to write the laws
But people hide their eyes and shut their jaws
Who the realest Never mind
Who doing it for the best there aint lies
What they wearing who is there
Ask yourself why you care
Somebody going ham on a gossip site
Catching feelings over rumors that are not your life
I dont like sometimes I even hate
But not the people they acts and ways
I dont like sometimes I even hate
Lord forgive let us pray
For pussy posers dummy greed
Polluted seas them wacky weeds
Nazi police wasted time
Zombie recruitment legal crime
I dont like
You dont like it neither
You said
Rebuke forgive and pray for these fake niggas
