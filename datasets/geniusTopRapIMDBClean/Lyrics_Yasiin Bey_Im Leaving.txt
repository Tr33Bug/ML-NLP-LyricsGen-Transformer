Well go head and leave
The call heard around the world from the wives of MCs
These cats is payin more than half a pound
My garment bagll snatch it down
Aint got the skate but we can probably run it back in town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern MC ie the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhymin no different from coal minin
We both on assignments to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin then them eyes start shinin
You be strugglin and strivin and they think you primetimin
Maintain and keep silent make note and observation
This confrontation this is the daily operation
My concentration stay focused on my recitation
Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation cause this aint no recreation
This is proball
And we lettin you know yall
At the show yall
Doin this for dough yall
Get the phone call
And Im ready to blow yall
Bout to go yall
Been a pleasure to know yall
And Im lettin you know that
Im leaving on a jet plane
I dont know if Ill be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that youll wait for me
Hold me like you know Ill never go
Even though you know I will
Im a travellin man
Movin through places space and time

But Inshallah Im comin back to you babyboo
Im a travellin man
Movin through places space and time
Got a lotta things I got to do
But Inshallah Im comin back to you babyboo
Im leaving
But God willin Ill be back home
To drop these heavyass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalogue of rap songs
My baby girl is walkin been away for that long
But no you havent
Well at least thats how it seem to me
My hometown is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leanin leisurely
The new jacks up in the parks smokin greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it
But its sweet scented when you been down for a minute
Move around city limits break it down with the vintage
The inovinin classical bboy image
Collect the winnings cause it the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cackalacks
Cali and the Cadillacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia state
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Lets set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Minasan make everybody out in Nippon say ichiban
Me God man Mo where you get it from Phenomenon
Scuse me thats a phone call
Its a show yall
Tryin to get this dough yall
Bout to blow yall
Been a pleasure to know yall
And Im lettin you know
Im leaving on a jet plane
I dont know if Ill be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that youll wait for me
Hold me like you know Ill never go
Even though you know I will
Im a travellin man
Movin through places space and time
Got a lotta things I got to do
But Inshallah Im comin back to you babyboo
Im a travellin man
Movin through places space and time
Got a lotta things I got to do
But God willin Im comin back to you back to you back to you

The Cakalacks all over the world we go
London all over the world we go
Japan we go over the world we go
Paris we go over the world we go
