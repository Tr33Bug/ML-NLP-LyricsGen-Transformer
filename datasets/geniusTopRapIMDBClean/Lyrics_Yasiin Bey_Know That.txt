I Strike the Empire Back
I Strike the Empire Back
Fuck the Empire
High flying like the Millenium Falcon piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo fronting on mes a nono
Understand doing this for my family
Ha ha check it out yall
Yo Im trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up told my daddy Id be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon switch hand
Get todays solid ground out of yesterdays quicksand
I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man
On small looseleaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but nowaday its time for me
The streets is watching me I watch back thats the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seekin the North beacon
From beating and hogeating from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding cotton thorns in your palms
Its for yall that I sketch these songs and it goes
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go manoamano
Kweli is you with me  What up what up 
Lets make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow looking for a brighter day
When yall wanna leave yall
Right away
Shout it out from EastWest  from South to Northern 
From Cackalack  to California 
From the coldest  to the warmest 
To the borders  cross the waters  understand
and know that I love you
We got love in the place
Shout out to all the Queens  all the Seeds 
To all the teams  thats gettin cream 
From outlaw  to emcees 
Make it happen  do your thing  understand
and know that I love you
Ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen
Guess who
The illest MC in the atmosphere
Yeah the Soul Controller
Who roam the frontier like a Buffalo Soldier
I follow the code of honor like a real man gonna
Never disrespect no women cause I love my momma
These cats be giving us praise but it aint that accurate
I give it up to God all that love and attachment get
Scary wellprepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to em clearly
Yall dont hear me though even when Im coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo why you starting me
I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent with the tears and sweat and what I bleed
MCs imitate the way we walk the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off
You come across soft
Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guestlist
Its like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it MCs in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know its only cause I love you


Shout it out from EastWest
From South to Northern 
From the richest  to the poorest 
To the elders  in the coffins 
Living native  dying for it  understand
And know that I love you
Yea yea we got love in the place
Shout out from up top  to the middle 
To black bottom  sky high 
Whether you colder than December
Or hotter than July
It dont stop til we complete this
And know that I love you
Keep this fly
Its so much to life when you just
Stay black
My people my people
