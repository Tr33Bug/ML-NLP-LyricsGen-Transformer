Bright moments bright moments always come back vivid
The fifth grade was epic citywide test pressure
The precrack era
Mr Schumer what a prick
Attitude match his wardrobe uglier than sin
This is BedStuy 82
Ninth floor three tiny rooms one view
Bucktown Roosevelt House
Their green grass is green our green grass is brown
Shots rang my phone wasnt touch tone
Were heavy beef in the street ET had to flee
Great heavens good grief
Hungry bellies bright gold on their teeth
The windows on the Ave look like sad eyes
They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by
And if you dare to stand you can see em cry
You can watch em scowl feel em prowl
While theyre steady sizing every inch about you
Fast math measuring what you amount to
The laughter the screams
The numeral the song of Psalms the book of dreams
Ends dont meet where the arms cant reach
Mean streets even when its free it aint cheap
Ongoing saga terminal diagnosis
Basic survival requires super heroics
No space in the budget for a cape
Its when you gotta fly by night to save the day
Crashlandings routinely happen
Some survive others never rise from the ashes
Watching asphalt and observing the Sabbath
Creates an Ecstatic and there you have it
From teenage love praying in tongue
Strange fruit batty boots and native drums
From hence I come so here we go
Signs and wonders all along the road
Some lies open some lies closed
Some stretchers role with no lies at all
Some riders dont know what they ridin for
Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
Wherever you ride whatever your lane
This road called life is a beautiful thing
And we are alive in amazing times
Delicate hearts diabolical minds
Revelations hatred love and war
And more and more and more and more
And more of less than ever before
Its just too much more for your mind to absorb
Its scary like hell but theres no doubt
We cant be alive in no time but NOW
Its just another shot to the heart
Its just a sure shot in the dark
Its just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side life in marvelous times
Life in marvelous times
Hey The Ecstatic
The temperatures rising everywhere
All over the world you can feel it
All over the world feel it
Spirits rise everywhere
Its just a sure shot to the heart
Its just a sure shot in the dark
Its just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side life in marvelous times
Life in marvelous times
Now always
