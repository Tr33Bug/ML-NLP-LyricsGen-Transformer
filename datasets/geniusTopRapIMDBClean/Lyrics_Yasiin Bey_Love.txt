They say that goodness in life belongs to those who believe
So I believe Yes
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When Im writing Im trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When Im writing Im trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish
My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasnt hard to see
I could hear he was sincere wasnt game or promotion
The entire affairs probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you got to pursue
121173 my life is testament
Praise the beneficent element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In 83 Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Aiyo power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what Im talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
Thats inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness
To make me nod my head in reverence
Should I visit this place in remembrance
Or build landmarks here as evidence
Nighttime spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise
Love love love love love
Love love love love love 
Yes yes yall and we dont stop because
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When Im writing Im trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme
I got love love and I be
Love love to emcee
Get love love and I be
Love love I emcee
Get love love and I be
Love love to emcee
Get love love and I be
Love Love  The MOS DEFinitely

My folks said they was in love when they made me
I take the love they made me with to make rhymes and beats
Can you feel  The raw deal is allwheel driven  right 
Contemplate the essence of beats rhymes and livin
Speech align with the rhythm  right  designed with the rhythm
Ears and eyes keep in good time with the rhythm
I shine with the rhythm the Black Star Galactica
Youre big number fatin we ancient like the abacus
After us I see most proceed to be trees
Sprouting leaves givin breeze to the we who believe
I MC which means I Must Cultivate the Earth
Straight back straight facts heartbeats and hard work
I be the Funky Drummer to soften the hard Earth
Amin  Pray Allah keep my soul and heart clean
Amin  Pray the same thing again for all my team
From Restoration to Fort Greene and on out to Queens
Uptown To Boogiedown yo just look around
Shook up the world like Ali in 63  right 
Im reaching a height that you said cannot be
Im bringing a light which you said we cant see
Saw the new day comin it look just like me
Sun bursts through the clouds my photo ID
I bring light to your day and raise your degree
The universal magnetic you must respect it
From end to beginning bright true and living
Everchanging but sustaining magnificent
Building the now for the promise of the infinite
Building the now for the promise of the infinite
Because
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When Im writing Im trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme
I got love love and I be
Love love to emcee
Get love love and I be
Love love to emcee
Get love love and I be
Love love to emcee
Get love love and I be
Love Love  The MOS DEFinitely
