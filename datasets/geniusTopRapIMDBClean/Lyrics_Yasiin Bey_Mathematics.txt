Buckabuckabuckabuckabuckabucka haha
You know the deal its just me yo
Beats by SuPrimo for all of my people Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos
Yo check it
1 for Charlie Hustle 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forthcoming live future shock
Its 5 dimensions 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin orbit with the probable 10th
The universe expands left
The body of my text possess extra strength
Powerlift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
Im blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
HipHop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projectsprisonindustry complex
Workingclass poor better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep its dangerous to dream
For chching cats get the chapow You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
Its a numbers game but shit dont add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15 of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of Americas largest cities is onequarter black
Thats why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound 20 more to a key
A 5 minute sentence hearing and youre no longer free
40 of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you aint home
I guess Michael Jackson was right you are not alone
Rock your hardhat black cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas large niggas dicetumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods cant spell but they could rock you at PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers ass
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
Its mathematics

Yo its 1 universal law but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you biddin for life mandatory
4 MCs murdered in the last 4 years
I aint trying to be the 5th when the millennium is here
Yo its 6 million ways to die from the 7 deadly thrills
8yearolds getting found with 9mils
Its 10 PM where your seeds at Whats the deal
He on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is 515
You best believe youve got to find a new grind to get CREAM
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some frontliners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business no faces just lines and statistics
From your phone your Zip Code to SSI digits
The system break man child and women into figures
2 columns for Who is and Who aint niggas
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camels back
Heres the secret
The million other straws underneath it
Its all mathematics
