This desire
I come home high and she start to cry
I cant take it
A brand new excuse does me no use
That wont make it
She be home with the kids this is no way to live
What can I say
I know its surreal but Im a hard headed still
Do things my way
And its so strong soo strong
Its like Im dying
Trying to hold on my body says oh no oh out there
Flying the price that I pay for the game that I play
Aint no game at all
Im up in the clouds and Im spiraling down
Nothing breaks the fall
And its so strong so strong
Its like Im dying
Try to hold on my body says oh no oh out there
Flying
Sounds of the sufferers pray
I come home high and she start to cry
I cant take it
A brand new excuse does me no use
That wont make it
She at home with the kids this is no way to live
What can I say
I know its surreal but Im a hard headed still
Black Dante and its so strong
So strong
So strong
So strong


Im out there flying
Flying
Flying
Flying
This game is fantastic desire

Mother mother
Head in her hands
Her first born son dead in her hands
The whole thing was a setup a scam
They knew it was set up and planned
Niggas he worked with wet him and ran and thats
Brother Brother
But son I dont see no brother hood
All I see is thugger hood
Get rich and fuck the hood
All they want is some good smoke from the hood
Lookin for the shorty good stroke from the hood
Thats how they touch the hood
But when I touch the hood Ill make it brighter black
Because Im brighter black
And Im so black Im bright shine through the blackest night
Shine when Im live shine via satellite
Shout in the hood we get the picture
Cuz everytime you out in the hood you got photographers witcha
Whats going on Ha
Understand this is real life
This how it goes on this how it goes on
It keep going on this how it goes on
Ghetto people look alive get free
Get involved remain to breatheHa Wooh
If Marvin was alive now wow what would I say to him
Where could I start How could I explain to him
I know the minor world would probably look strange to him
Would he feel like today had a place for him
Global imprisonment sickness indifference
When he said Save the babies was we listenin
When he said Mercy mercy did he really know
That decades later wed still be killin folks
Or did he hope that we would realize
That we the first the son of earth
The moon and stars the great beyond
We black and proud we brave and strong
We raise it up we quiet storm forever fresh
And keepin on
Ha Ghetto people look alive and free ya get real
This how it goes on and you say you say
This how it goes on and you say you say
This how it goes on
Ghetto people look alive and free and breathe Ha
Hold the beat Stop the beat Drop the beat
Hold the beat Stop the beat Drop the beat
Hold the beat Stop the beat Drop the beat
Hold the beat Stop the beat Got the beat
There aint nothin to be afraid of
Ghetto people look alive and free ya get real
This how it goes on
This how it goes on keep goin on
This how it goes on
Now breathe
Marvelous marvelous marvelous Marvin
