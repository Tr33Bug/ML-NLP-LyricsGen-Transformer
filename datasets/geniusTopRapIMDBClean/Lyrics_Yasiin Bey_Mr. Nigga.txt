Mr Nigga Lyrics
Say ho everybody say ho
By the way yo
I said take it slow like way back in the dayyo
By the way yo everybody say ho
Everybody say hooooo hooo
Everybody say ho
And check it out now
Who is the cat eating out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be riding up in the highrise elevator
Other tenants who be prayin that he aint the new neighbor
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
They try to play him like a chump cause he got what they want
He under thirty years old but already hes a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
VIP at the club backstage at the show
Yes yall  the best crib the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze  say word 
Checks with Os ooooohs
Straight all across the globe watch got three timezones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants two bank accounts two homes
One problem even with the Os on his check
The popo stop him and show no respect
Is there a problem officer Damn straight its called race
That motivate the jake  woowoo  to give chase
Say they want you successful but that aint the case
You living large your skin is dark they flash a light in your face
Now who is cat dining out on the town
Maitred wanna take a whole year to sit him down
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now who is the cat at Armani buying wears
With the tourists who be asking him do you work here
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga


Yo the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def
White folks gotta mumble the chorus beneath they breath
I didnt say it 
But theyll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar while this song is in they car
And even if theyve never said it lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like late night Im on a first class flight
The only brother in sight the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat 2C
She approach officially talking about Excuse me
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she dont believe that Im in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she come by walkin past
I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph
Wowwww Mr Nigga I love you I have all your albums 
They stay on nigga patrol on American roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane go where they please
But I go over seas and I get overseized
London Heathrow me and my people
They think that illegals a synonym for negro
Far away places customs agents flagrant
They think the dark faces smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalyis followed by Xrays
Interrogated and detained til damn near the next day
No evidence no apology and no regard
Even for the big American rap star
For us especially us most especially
A Mr Nigga VIP jail cell just for me
If I knew you were coming Id have baked a cake 
Just got some shoepolish painted my face
They say they want you successful but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace they start changing up the tempo
Now who is cat riding out on the town
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride pat him down
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill
They gotta send it to the lab to make sure the shit is real
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga Nigga
You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna
Woody Allen molested and married his stepdaughter
Same press kicking dirt on Michaels name
Show Woody and SoonYi at the playoff game  Holding hands 
Sit back and just bug think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black
OJ found innocent by jury of his peers
And they been fucking with that nigga for the last five years
Is it fair is it equal is it just is it right
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white
If white boys doing it well its success
When I start doing well its suspect
Dont hate me my folks is poor I just got money
Americas five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up yo straight up
Its new yall livin off of slave traders paper
But Im a live though yo Im a live though
Im puttin up the big swing for my kids yo
Got my mom the fat waterfront crib yo
Im a get her them pretty bay windows
Im a cop a nice home to provide in
A safe environment for seeds to reside in
A fresh whip for my whole family to ride in
And if Im still Mr Nigga I wont find it suprisin
