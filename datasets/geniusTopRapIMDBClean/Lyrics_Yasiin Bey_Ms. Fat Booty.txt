Ms Fat Booty Lyrics
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
Man duke I was in love with this girl duke
I was tore up dog Im tellin you man
Shit is wild man for real
Its shes from let me tell you about her
Yo in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped money clip phone flip the six range
I seen her on the Ave spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants hot damn
Whats your name love Where you came from
Neck and wrist laced up very little makeup
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
I tried to play it low key but couldnt keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like Yo Im leavin now
An hour later sounds from Jamaica
Shes sippin Cris straight up skankin windin her waist up
Scene 2  my fams throwin a jam
Fareed is on the stand big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
Ayo this my man Mos baby let me introduce
I turned around  Say word 
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin to play me for the herb  Yeah thats her 
Shocked as hell she couldnt get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin Oh Im fine my name is Mos Im Sharice
I heard so much good about you its nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin directly next to me
Im type polite but now Im lookin at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes sweet voice is fuckin with me mentally
We conversated made her laugh  yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo she wild sweet yo
Im bout to murk I say peace to the family
She hop up like How you gon leave before you dance with me
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
She blew my whole head with that duke I was like word
I played it low though
I was like yeah aight come on then lets go
Niggas was mad niggas was so sick I tell  ya 
Yo honey was so blazin she was just
Yo she looked like Jayne Kennedy word bond to my mother man
She was that ill man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin to me
Yo let me apologize for the other night I know it wasnt right
But baby you know what its like some brothers dont be comin right
I understand Im feelin you
Besides Can I have a dance aint really that original
We laughed about it traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin Lovers Rock I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered Honey lets exchange numbers
Scene 3  weeks of datin late night conversation
In the crib heart racin tryin to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids the room fell silent
She walked away smilin singin Gregory Isaacs
Like If I dont if I dont have you
Showin me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin Sade Sweetest Taboo
Burnin candles all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my JO Come now I cant say no
Ginseng tree trunks rockin the Pfunk
Cockin her knees up champion lover not ease up
Three months  she call I feel Im runnin a fever
Six months  Im tellin her I desperately need her
Nine months  flulike symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down Im really tryin to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know sweetheart I got to have it
She tellin me commitment is somethin she cant manage
Wake up the next mornin she gone like it was magic
Aww damn it My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911s unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week Mu hit me up I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin ass Asian playin lay it down and lick me up
What
