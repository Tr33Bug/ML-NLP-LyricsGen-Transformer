Theres nothing more refreshing  That cool refreshing drink 
Than a cool crisp clean glass of water
On a warm summers day  That cool refreshing drink 
Try it with your friends
New World Water make the tide rise high
Come inland and make your house go Bye  My house 
Fools done upset the Old Man River
Made him carry slave ships and fed him dead niggas
Now his belly full and he about to flood somethin
So Im throwin rope that aint tied to nothin
Tell your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since
The New World Water and every drop counts
You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna
But it dont rain a full week some summers
And its about to get real wild in the half
You be buying Evian just to take a fuckin bath
Heads is acting wild sippin poor puffin dank
Competin with the next man for higher playin rank
See I aint got time tryin to be Big Hank
Fuck a bank I need a twentyyear water tank
Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweatin they goods
The sun is sitting in the treetops burnin the woods
And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher
They say Dont drink the water We need it for the fire
New York is drinkin it  New World Water 
Now all of California is drinkin it  New World Water 
Way up North and Down South is drinkin it  New World Water 
Used to have minerals and zinc in it  New World Water 
Now they say it got lead and stink in it  New World Water 
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Push the water table lopside
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam across the sea
Man you gotta cook with it bathe and clean with it  Thats right 
When its hot summertime you fiend for it  Let em know 
You gotta put it in the iron you steamin with  Thats right 
Its what they dress wounds and treat diseases with  Shout it out 
The rich and poor black and white got need for it  Thats right 
And everybody in the world can agree with this  Let em know 
Consumption promotes health and easiness  Thats right 
Go too long without it on this earth and you leavin it  Shout it out 
Americans wastin it on some leisure shit  Say word 
Another nation be desperately seekin it  Let em know 
Bacteria washing up on they beaches  Say word 
Dont drink the water son they cant wash they feet with it  Let em know 
Young babies in perpetual neediness  Say word 
Epidemics hoppin up off the petri dish  Let em know 
Control centers try to play it all secretive  Say word 
To avoid public panic and freakiness  Let em know 
There are places where TB is common as TV
Cause foreignbased companies go and get greedy
The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line
Have it purified sell it for a dollar twentyfive


Now the world is drinkin it  New World Water 
Your moms wife and baby girl is drinkin it  New World Water 
Up North and Down South is drinkin it  New World Water 
You should just have to go to your sink for it  New World Water 
The cash registers is goin chachink for it  New World Water 
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Got the fish lookin cockeyed
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause its all about gettin that cash  Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash  Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash  Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash  Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash  Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash  Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash  Money
