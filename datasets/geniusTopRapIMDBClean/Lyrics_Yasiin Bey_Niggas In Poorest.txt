Poor so hard this shit crazy walk outside the whole world hate me
Nervous stares at the thoroughfare surveillance cameras police tracing

Poor so hard bitch behave standing behind the deucedeucetrey
Icecold heat blow closed casket cold case

And I live like a man who is dead already
I have no fear whatsoever of anybody or anything


To the kings and queens and everyone in every place yo
Dont get caught up in no throne dont get caught up in no throne
Dont get caught up in no throne
Towers of Babylon rise up and so they shall fall
As it was written before amen so it goes on
Dont get caught up in no throne dont get caught up in no throne
Dont get caught up in no throne
These devils out here lying acting like the people aint dying
We silver and they gold aint never saved a soul
Dont get caught up in no throne dont get caught up in no throne
Dont get caught up in no throne
Signs through the earth and through the heavens lunar solar eclipses
We seeking for forgiveness and safety for our children
Dont get caught up in no throne dont get caught up in no throne
Dont get caught up in no throne Allah is in control
