Yeah one for the treble two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you wanna keep pace
Oh No
Niggas aint scared to hustle
Its been 7 days the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Say my name say my name
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and paved my game
My own two raise my flame cause dickridin aint my thang
I earned what they said I wouldnt
I got it the way they said I couldnt
But now Im gettin it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad cause Im gettin caked out from my bookings
When yall was askin permission I just stepped up and took it
What The kids better buy my rookie card now
Cause after this year the price aint comin down
And if you got a joint bubblin then get money now
Cause in a minute theres gonna be some real trouble comin out
Just a warnin  as usual some cats wont heed it
The hardheaded always gotta feel it to believe it
Its a shame they jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent or dirty like the 71 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin
You keep on schemin man gimme some more reason
To have the women in your mamas church screamin Lord Jesus
Harder than yall cause Im smarter than yall
I know that deep down its gotta be botherin yall
Pay attention watch Flaco get larger than yall
Pour your pride on the rocks and make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for yall it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The doordie stay rumblin and bubblin hard
And when we move we aint got no discussion at all
East Coasts on your neck and you aint shruggin it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin off
Im Daddy Brooklyn yall niggas are the sons of New York
Gettin spanked when its too much trouble to talk
Respect mine


Oh No
Look at who they let in the back do
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the East to West Coast
Queens salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness Pharoahes raps are blazin
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go twoways without Skytel pagers
Im intellectual pass more essaysess
Than motorcade police parades through East LA
More beef then delis thus what I vent is just  Uh 
What you lust to vent its irrele
Huh hallelujah Pharoahe Monchll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind  screw ya
Get the picture sit ya seat ya greet ya with scriptures
Im equipped to rip ya reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leavin you mentally unfocused here
MCs just come on round
Youre the next contestants on CatchABeatDown
Dont be hesitant sound cracks the sediment
Its evident we medicine for your whole town
Skys the limit games infinite when Im in it
All windows is tinted how you seein me when Im in it
Rap  we got it on lock man stop that
Put that mic back down boy drop that
Pharoahes flows blows shows like Afros
We hate yall though thats why Nate Dogg go
Oh No
Niggas aint scared to hustle
Its been 7 days the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
