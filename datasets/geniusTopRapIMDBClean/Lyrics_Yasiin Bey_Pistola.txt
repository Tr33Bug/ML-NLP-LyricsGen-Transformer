Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Dont blink your eyes and say goodbye
Cause I know you know that I know you know that love is danger
Criminal minded gangster of love
Charms in your arms your gun is wild warm
Worn bang bang shoot em up
Tips in your clip clickclack use em up
Bad intentions and a very good shot
X marks the spot where you cross the heart
Candlelight vigil on my memory block
Commemorate the date where the bomb got dropped
Love study war no more
Put your weapon away quit collecting the slain
She said You right I dont wanna fight
I just like the fire and the flashinglights
Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Dont blink your eyes and say goodbye
Cause I know you know that I know you know that love is danger
If you are to fall in love
Then where should you stand to begin with
And when the fallings done
How bad should you plan to get injured
And if you land on your feet
Do it count as a fall or a jump
And do it feel like a fall
When the hands that pushed you were holding you up
Close encounter got you wide open
Heartache got your boombox going
Music and vocals lonely and soulful
Youre back at the scene where your sweet dreams sold you
Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Dont blink your eyes and say goodbye
Cause I know you know that I know you know what love is


Cowboys and girls oh baby

Cowboys and girls oh baby
I rememberwhen we used to play
Cowboys and girls

Cowboys and girls
Shoot em up bang bang
We at the movies and youre a star
