Pretty Dancer Lyrics
Absolutely, Flaco!

Fresh and I'm fresh and my fresh just get fresher
Diamonds in production glow greater than the pressure
The none turn to some and the some turn to more
The more turn to many and the many turn to all
Shoutin' all or nothing like it's nothing at all
Do not kno' what ya got til it got gone
Same song, new time signature
New brand hustle with the long time arithmetic
Bey, from the preacher man, number man, understand
Curves and sliders, overs and underhands
Black Batman, knock em out the park
Pitch, quiet fire sniper not the one you tryna box with
Block work when the block turn jobless
And triple beams ain't the best means to weigh your options
Smarts, get smart with your smartness
Too busy surviving to argue 'bout Darwin...Darling!
See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Me, Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it, (see me do it)
Ready, steady, step it out

Big swing swing with bangers and thing thingers
Soul glo zinging all over the ring finger
Yo, yo! Don't play me so close
Make me tell you something that you ain't really ready to know
Fight camp you was in top form
Fight night, damn you ain't breakin' popcorn
Aw man word bond?
Word is bond! Ultimatum
Lights off, smelling salts resuscitate em
I don't underrate em son, I don't nothing-rate em
All I do is pop pop, frustrate em
Exacerbate em, sharp shoot, lacerate em
Steady hustle, shuffle shuffle, fascinate em
Ecstatic nature black imagination activated
True and living elevated, you are rockin' with the greatest
Ecstatic nature black imagination activated
True and living elevated, you are rockin' with the greatest

It's like a dove from up above
See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Me, Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it (see me do it)
Ready, steady, step it out
Fly like a dove from up above
See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Me, Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it (see me do it)
Ready, steady, step it out
