Bey
Top priority
Peace before everything God before anything
Love before anything real before everything
Home before anyplace truth before anything
Style and stay radiate love power slay the hate
Truth killer flaky face Beyll say it to they face
Aint afraid to major straight grace set the table straight
Flow greatest like the greatest lakes
Capes on great estates quiet water major waves
Steer the course make a way
And come ashore on a greater day
Home grown from the greatest grain
Full flavor in the native strain now put that on your brainy brain
Full exposure to faith and slang
Minimum wage and major gains
Yasiin Dante to Bey
From day to night to day to day they came to play
We came to stay get out the way
Beotch sunspot hot heat rocks
Brooklyn finest preservation of beatbox
Friend or foe poison or detox
When we rock the people I respond priority
Peace before anything God before everything
Love before anything real before everything
Home before anyplace shoot before anything
Style and state radiate love power slay the hate
Priority
Love powers
