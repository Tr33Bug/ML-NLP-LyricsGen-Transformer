One thing I want to assure them
If they think Im gonna change or compromise
My attitude and my way of life or
In my expression or in my goal
Towards politics
They are making me stronger
And I am much more stronger now
Bang to the boogy
Say up jump the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
There it go like simple the plainness its primal and basic
Zulu arrangement rockin amazement
Flaco radiating from heaven to pavement
They phony as a facelift Im nothing to play with
Spent time hating it but that aint changing it
God give it to me nobody aint takin it
Therefore moving on the base for stimulus
Im standing in the twilight and watching them get it in
The walls are tremblin the air is simmering
She movin like more than her ears are listenin whoa now
Testin your equilibrium
Sonic wave booming all over your intimate
Skin on skin and skin on skin again
Put it all get it all get on get it in
Ladies and gentlemen misters and mistresses
Cousins uncles aunties and synonyms there it is boogieman
Hah
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down
Quiet dog bite hard my God
Said and the rocket dont stop
Brooklyn in the kitchen heat up the stovetop
Bey in the Empire State and navigating the way
Preservation make the greatest hiphop
The cool dudes swagger they terribly corny
They flow so petty unsteady its boring
These dudes aint dope but they on it
They need to get off it so wack wack is all you can call it
Therefore movin on to Def for stimulus
Regardless of what zone what town you represent
A bullet into all of your settlements
Tower to tenement
I mold through for all of the element
Simmer down I manage your mayhem
Im bright as the AM
Engine bout to roll out the station
Im blessed with the fresh from day one
I got it til day done
We all going back to the same one
Its the cost of motivation Ill stay with
Remarkable flavors
That all bear the mark of the greatness
Woah now the kid is from Buck Town
Your girl is in love now
You chumps dont want to get shut down shoo
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down now
Simmer down
Quiet dog bite hard lets rock
Hah
And we dont stop
See you rock to the rhythm we dont stop
So you maintain the rock and you dont stop
You keep up the rock and you dont stop
The rock 
Maintain the rock and you dont stop
The rock 
You keep up the rock and you dont stop
The rock 
Maintain the rock and you dont stop
The rock 
You keep up the rock quiet dog bite hard my God
Hah
