Revelations
Dont stop keep on
Sunshine
Ecstatic
Flaco
Boogieman
Standing in the sun getting black as I want
You playing good D and that aint backing me up
Skywalker baby aint no jack in my hammer
I got a whole lot to say so I aint talking to them
I hear em eavesdroppin I turn it up louder
Black freedom black genius black power
Black ink for printing the black dollar
And tell the CIA I say now what
And cc is central bank
Loose change body slamming big money tanks
We tell God thanks
Yall tellin us that God dont rank thats why your breath stank
Yuck lay off the bacon and smokes
Quit laying off the good working folks quit the hoax
And lay off the corny color jokes
And contrary to popular the coloreds is awoke
Ya big dope yuck
Keep them out your face keep em in your prayers
Either that keep em in the cross hairs
Better still keep a even dose of each
Cause until you get justice you wont get peace
Peace peace peace peace peace
The gun shot say wa da da dang
Wa da da da da dang
Wa da da da da da da da da dang ay
They shout peace peace peace
They shout peace peace peace
The firefight lit wa da da dang
Wa da da da da dang
Wa da da da da da da da da dang ay
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Can I get better now what is that for and more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Killers just killing now what they kill for and more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Can I get better now what is that for and more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Revelations
Dont stop keep on
