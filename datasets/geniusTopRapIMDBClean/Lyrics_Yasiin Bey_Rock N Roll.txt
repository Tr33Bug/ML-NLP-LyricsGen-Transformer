They sang  songs for relaxation
They sang  songs to take their minds up off that
Fucked up situation
I am yes I am the descendant  yes yes 
Of those folks whose backs got broke
Who fell down inside the gun smoke
Black people  Chains on their ankles and feet
I am descendants of the builders of your street
Black people  Tenders to your cotton money
I am hiphop
Its heavy metal for the black people
I am rock and roll  rock and roll rocknroll 
Been here forever
