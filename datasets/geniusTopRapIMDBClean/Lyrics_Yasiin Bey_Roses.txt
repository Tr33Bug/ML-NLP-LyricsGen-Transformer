When Im down I just draw some roses
On a pretty piece of paper
With my red Stabilo Pencil
So halfway through I feel so much better  Fresh 
I imagine happiness  Wide awake in my dreams  and it runs right to me such amazing beauty  Why 
You dont have to  No necessary  cut up no roses  Be easy chopper 
Please just leave them living  Just cool let creation grow 
Got my pencil  Check one  got pretty paper  Check two check it out 
Please dont worry were forgiven  Power and grace lets move 
I have found just the perfect feelin  And it starts the true sensation 
Finally cause Im grateful  Gratitude and my attitude this morning 
I can feel your spirit  Feel it  coming closer on me  Every way 
It is grand  Yes  just to be reminded  Good God when they reminisce over you for real 
Reminded of the good things  Good things good things good things 
Living in a new day  New day bright star  that no one can tear down  Undeniable 
You dont have to  No necessary  cut up no roses  Be easy on the cut 
Please just leave them living  just ease let creation grow 
Got my pencil  Check one  got pretty paper  Check two check it out 
Please dont worry were forgiven
Power and grace
Yellow for friendship red for love
Black for the universal stars above
Pink buds that I bought her on Valentine
She said it was forever then she changed her mind
I said a little prayer then I cleared my eyes
Cause I feel the draw on my heartstrings drawing the line
Started off with a orchid natural portrait
I aint Picasso but that aint important
Faith smart dude never graduated art school
Stay tuned Ima show you how my art move
Shape and dimension flow and extension
Symmetry and shade blowin out the frame
Sign off my name Dante when Im finished
Put it to your memory for permanent exhibit
Love hard work and its worth every minute
Abstract is still life real life kinetic
