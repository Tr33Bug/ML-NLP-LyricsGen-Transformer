Let the sun shine 
Yeah yeah its a brand new day yall  Let the sunshine in 
Turn me up in the top a little bit dawg
I want you to know I want you to hear this one  The suns shinin 
Loud and clear bright and early
Listen
I dont hate players I dont love the game
Im the shot clock way above the game
To be point blank witchu  motherfuck the game
I got all this work on me I aint come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dawg not to Def Im not impressed
Im not amused Im not confused Im not the dude
Grown man business I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin this is not for you
On my JO with beats by Kanye yo
My name on the marquee your name off the payroll
Style fresh like Im still a day old
And its been like that since the day 0
Im on time like a Roley or Seiko
Step on deck your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out get down or lay low
Let the sun shine 
Standin in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga I am Black Dante  Let the sunshine in 
That nigga that dude
Black people lets move  The suns shinin 
Shout out to my man Talib Kweli yes
We on topa topa shotta shotta
Check it out
Slim nigga that cast a big shadow
Cherokee Red that shoot the long arrow
Got mo skill mo aim and mo ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like Hail Mary full of grace
Niggas come in and shoot up the place and make you pull up your face
The deck Ima pull out the ace
From the jungles of the Empire State where it aint no escape
247 718 and thats like every night every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the States Im collectin my pay
Blast off then Im back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Proball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
Let the sun shine 
Like a long time man of the way
You understandin me straight  Let the sunshine in 
Yes yes no doubt Excellence
Its what it is its what it is and thats what it is you see
The suns shinin 
Ha Fire
Cause it is deeper sweeter richer crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God and involve with niggas
These elements help evolve my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn  it dont matter if ya holler or whisper
You comin through clear cause Im right here witcha
Aint gotta edit your slang  I got it I get ya
Yo brothers and sisters fathers and mothers
The lovers the leavers the doubters believers
The stayers the quitters the bitches the niggas
Rebel guerrillas to ghetto civilians
Yall gon feel it from the first to the millionth
Its extra ordinary and plain
I walked a thousand paces of life ahead of the game
By the time that you get where Im standin Ill be gone
Yall make moves but yall just move wrong
Let the sun shine 
I move in and yall must move on cause Im molto strong
And I know what my feet move for  Let the sunshine in 
Make it go without a brand new car
I was fresh without a brand new song
Dont give a fuck about what brand you are  The suns shinin 
Im concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me yall
Be good to your family yall
No matter where your families are
Cause everybody need family yall
Raise a hand if you understand me yall
Everybody need family yall
Be good to your families dawg
Understand no matter where your families are
Everybody need family dawg
Raise your hand you understand me pah
Thats what it is thats my man
Family of my family Pencil Pete
My man too all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those still in the struggle
Assata Mumia Sundiata my man Jamil
Let the sun shine 
Life is real
To all the real soldiers black people  Let the sunshine in 
We family yall  The suns shinin 
Let it be bright
