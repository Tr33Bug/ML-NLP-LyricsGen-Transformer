Youre living at a time of extremism a time of revolution
A time where theres got to be a change
People in power have misused it
And now there has to be a change
And a better world has to be built
And the only way is going to be built is with extreme methods
And I for one will join in with anyone
Dont care what color you are
As long as you want to change this miserable condition
That exists on this earth
Thank you
