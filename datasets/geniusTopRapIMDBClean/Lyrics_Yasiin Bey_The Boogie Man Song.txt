The Boogie Man Song Lyrics
Bismillah ir Rhman ir Raheem
{In The Name Of God, The Most Merciful, The Most Compassionate}
What it is, what it is, what it is
What it is
What it is, what it is, what it is
What it is
See me, want me, give me, touch me
Feed me, fuck me, love me, trust me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your favorite nightmare
Close your eyes and I'll be right there
Wide open... All over... Again
See me, touch me, give me, want me
Feed me, fuck me, trust me, love me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your favorite nightmare
Close your eyes and I'll be right there
Wide open... All over... Again, again...
Ag-a-in
