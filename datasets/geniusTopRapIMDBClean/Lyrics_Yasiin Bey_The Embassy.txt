Boogie  Boogie  man  man 
This is your captain speaking with just a little flight information
Coming up on the left were going to be catching a glimpse of the Grand Canyon
On the right you can be able to see the Hoover Dam in just a few minutes
Were flying at an altitude of 37000 feet
And our airspeed is four hundred miles an hour
Couple little facts here
Im packing a Colt King Cobra
Thats a 357 caliber firearm with a black rubbergrip and a sixinch barrel
Also the copilot is carrying a Kimber Custom defense pistol with all the bells and whistles youd expect from a custom gun of that kind
With an alloy frame and bevel treatment on the entire gun
And our Chief Flight Attendant Roger has a uh Ruger Bearcat
That 22 with a handfluted cylinder
All three are capable of piercing body armor at a distance of up to twentyseven feet
And you can put a hole in human bone and flesh the size of the Grand Canyon
Which by the way is coming up on the lefthand side of the plane
So just sit back relax and enjoy the rest of your flight
From the top la la la la
La la la la lalalalala
La la la la lalalalalalalala
Mentioned that he worked for the embassy
People seem to find that interesting
High status intrigue and mystery
Special code name on the hotel registry
I love it when they say
Enjoy your stay
They say it how they mean it
Cause thats the way they been trained
Show you to your room
A suite with a view
When if anything at all
Do not hesitate to call
Nice The greatest the greatest
Compliments tooth brush tooth paste razors
A Bible a Quran in a drawer
Or depending where you are
Tend to whisper through the walls
She was calling on God
The greatest the greatest
Salutations congratulations
Reservations exclusive arrangements
Dinner with the patrons the scenery is amazing
Its so outrageous they whisper when they say it
When its really real its even realer than The Matrix
Classic modern ancient flagrant
Get a special thrill every time they get to say it
Peace I work with the embassy
On behalf of imagination industry
I come visit you come visit
Such a pleasure official business
La la la la
La la la la lalalala
Boogey boogey man man 
La la la lalalalalalalalala
The Embassygreetings
