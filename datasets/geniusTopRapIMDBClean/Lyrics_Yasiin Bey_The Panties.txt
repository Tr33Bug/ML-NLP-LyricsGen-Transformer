The Panties Lyrics
I just want you to, relax
Ease into it
Baby slow down, just take your time
You and me gon' be here for a while, okay
Baby don't rush this, take your time
You and me gon' be here for a while, okay
I got so much that I want to do
I just wanna be close to you, okay
I got so much that I want to do
That I can show you better than I can say
Don't wanna be nowhere but here
Nowhere in this atmosphere
Stratosphere, ionosphere
Ain't no sphere that's bright like here
Don't wanna be nowhere but here
Nowhere in this atmosphere, I'm good where I am
Baby slow down, take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while, okay, hey
I got so much that I want to do
I can show you better than I can say, let me show you
Let me show you, let me show you
Let me show you, let me show you
I wanna show you, let me show you
Let me show you, let me show you
Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Come let me take you by the hand
Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me show you how, let me show you how
Let me show you now, let me show it out
Let me show you how, I wanna show ya how
Let me show ya, let me show ya
Let me show ya, let me show ya, let me show ya, ohh
