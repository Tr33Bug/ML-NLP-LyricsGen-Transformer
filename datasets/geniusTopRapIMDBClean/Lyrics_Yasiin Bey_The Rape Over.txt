Hey lil souljahs is you ready for war
But dont ask what youre fighting for
Just hope that you survived the gunfight the drama the stress
You get in the line of fire we get the big ass cheques
You gettin your choice of pimp make your choice and fall in
This is ho stroll B I take that cock in your behind biatch
Hit the streets and perform for us
Hold hard and bring it on to us fucker
I let you sip cups of Army get a Mercedes
And kick back and let you pay me my Mack is crazy
I leave the knife and fist fight filled with glamour
Yeah take a picture with this platinumplated sledgehammer
We overdo it add the fire and explosion to it
We sow confusion we run rap music

We poke out our asses for a chance to cash in
