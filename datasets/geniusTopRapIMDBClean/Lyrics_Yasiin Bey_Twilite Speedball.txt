Have fun yall
Have fun yall
The city breathing all down your neck
Bad news and good dope special effects
And realitys teeth
Bright black sinking in deep
Who aint shy of the pain
Who aint shy if the pleasure just the same
Life is a game I heard the homie say
Well I came to win so Im not here to play
Have fun  Get it get it 
Dont stop
Ecstatic
Fantastic
Wild
People
Bad news and good dope
Powder potion pills smoke
Baby how you trying to go
Duro o dolce fast or slow
Yay no
Its OK you can have it your way love
It aint all good but baby Im cool
Feeling great feeling good how are you
10 Condition 90 response
Survival mathematics the number man psalm
Old dads drop the jewels so pure
When the times get raw theres something I recall
Sometimes I dont remember it at all
And it gets stormed by the weather with no umbrella
Sky release pressure and the ground get wetter
My outfit fd up
Coulda looked fresher
But guess what
The hell with parade day rain
Tsunami and sunshine a vomit is the same
Life is a game I heard the homie say
Well I came to win

Bad news and good dope
