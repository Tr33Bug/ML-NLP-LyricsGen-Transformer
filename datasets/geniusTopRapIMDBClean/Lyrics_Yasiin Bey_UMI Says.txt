UMI Says Lyrics
I don't wanna write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now
I don't wanna take no time to write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now, heyyyy! (World premiere)
Tomorrow may never come
For you or me, life is not promised
Tomorrow may never show up
For you and me, this life is not promised
I ain't no perfect man
I'm tryin' to do the best that I can with what it is I have
I ain't no perfect man
I'm tryin' to do the best that I can with what it is I have
Put my heart and soul into this song
I hope you feel me
From where I am, to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely
Tomorrow may never come
For you and me, life is not promised
Tomorrow may never appear
You better hold this very moment very close to you (Right now)
Very close to you (Right now)
So close to you! Soooo close to you! (Right.. NOW!)
Don't be afraid, just let it shine

My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see

I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free...
You might also like
Sometimes, I get discouraged
I look around and, things are so weak, people are so weak
Sometimes, sometimes, I feel like cryin'
Sometimes, my heart beat's heavy
Sometimes, I just wanna leave and.. fly away! (Like a dove)
Sometimes, I don't know what to do with myself (Ow!!!)
Passion takes over me
Feel like a man, goin' insane, losin' my brain, tryna maintain, doin' my thang
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Put my heart and soul into this, y'all!
I hope you feel me, where I am to wherever you are (Ha-ha!)
Sometimes, I don't wanna be bothered
Sometimes, I just want a quiet life â€” me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes, I don't wanna get into no war
Sometimes, I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes, I just wanna be a man, but..

Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Jiddo said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My elders said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All my people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me

Black people unite and let's all get down
Gotta have what? Gotta have that love
Peace and understanding
One God, one light
One man, one voice, one mic
Black people unite, come on, and do it right
Black people unite, come on, and do it right
Black people unite, come on, and get down
Gotta have what? Love, peace and understanding
One God, one voice, one life
One man, gon' shine my light
Black people unite, now hop up and do it right
Black people unite, now come on and do it right
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
Yeah, baby, that's what I like
