Sometimes I get discouraged
I look around and things are so weak people are so weak
Sometimes sometimes I feel like cryin
Sometimes my heart beats heavy
Sometimes I just wanna leave and fly away  Like a dove 
Sometimes I dont know what to do with myself  Ow 
Passion takes over me
Feel like a man goin insane losin my brain tryna maintain doin my thang
Heyheyheyheyhey
Put my heart and soul into this yall
I hope you feel me where I am to wherever you are  Haha 
Sometimes I dont wanna be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life  me and my babies me and my lady
Sometimes I dont wanna get into no war
Sometimes I dont wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man but
