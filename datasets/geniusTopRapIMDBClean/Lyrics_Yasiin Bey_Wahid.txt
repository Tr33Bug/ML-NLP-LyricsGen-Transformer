Whenallissaidanddonetheresonlyone
Cash and carry legendary Sagitarri styles vary
And its very necessary get it clearly
Never scary barely worried bright and early
Bald head straight or curly mundane or otherworldly
No chain nada jewelry that jackers cant snatch
The gingerbread the slave masters cant catch
Blat Now put your minds on that
Get real or get back quit frontin face facts
The oldtimers say were living in the final days
Gun smoke young folks living any kind of way
Gangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways
Meanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates
Crash hit the market gates marvels of the modern age
Access is instant and treachery is commonplace
I sense the dangers and Im not afraid
Because when all is said and done theres only ONE
Man up playboy playing the game boy
Pull back spectacular aim boy
Say what you say boy whoever could make noise
And ride range off in the same voice
Conduct an arrangement with definite language
Its pure inspiration for this generation
Speak true free love
Because when all is said and done theres only one
And the one cyaa done so cool
Schooling the young like Rev Run  whose house 
Quote Pac and tell em keep their heads up
And when the pressure comes down press back and press up
Fret not ghetto world guess what
God is on your side the devil is a lie  alive 
The Empire holds all the gold and the guns
But when all is said and done theres only
La ilaha illAllah
