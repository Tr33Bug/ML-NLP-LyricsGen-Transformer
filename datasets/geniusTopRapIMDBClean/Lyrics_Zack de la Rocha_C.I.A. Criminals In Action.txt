CIA  Criminals In Action  Lyrics
Yea yea yea yea yea
KRS1 coming through
Big Zack Last Emperor
WOOP WOOP
Ha ha
Thats the sound of EMS
Ha ha
Last Emperor KRS
Ha ha
Big Zack you know the rest
Now we gonna come down like this now hold tight all crew
LISTEN
This voice shatters the calm of the day like an alarm
To wake up bright anew and take up arms
Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war
Cause the toxic rock imports gettin on your door
CIA I see ya later cause your time is coming soon
I flip the shit like Pacino and its your Dog Day Afternoon
Attica Attica drug agents you bring your statica
My alphabet will slash that neck and flip you automatica
Dramatic like Ali Shaheed Muhammed brought the vibe
I bring the sun at Red Dawn upon the thoughts of Frantz Fanon
So stand at attention devil dirge
Youll never survive choosin sides against the wretched of the Earth
The infiltrator tribe intoxicator people incarcerator
Liberation movement annihilator
We got you clocked pushing rocks and it fail
We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Minh trail
We got the truth daddy Last Emperor KRS and
History manifested tomorrow next lesson
YOU CLAIM IM SELLING CRACK BUT YOU BE DOIN THAT
You claim you claim you you claim claim
You claim Im selling crack but you be doin that
You know the cops they got a network for the toxic rock
YOU CLAIM IM SELLING CRACK BUT YOU BE DOIN THAT
So get that flashlight out of my face
You you you claim Im selling crack but you be doin that
The Last Emperor KRSOne and Big Zack
As free market capitalism and technology expands
The third worlds fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland
So it takes bands to demand the government provide answers
When Lady Liberty has me Bewitched like Samantha
And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer
To all my Black Magic romancers and acid rain dancers
Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza
We fear no man and throw jams
That attack counterintelligence programs
Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan  hah 
I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians
Now what the hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us
I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to Zealots
I saw an Iron Curtain called hiphop and got it open like Boris Yeltsin
Whirlwind tornadoes in the rain forest if you say so  whosssshhh 
KRS and The Last Emperor like the Green Hornet and Kato
Zach de la Rocha brings the enraged flow but all three drop science
And become the most powerful alliance since NATO
YOU CLAIM IM SELLING CRACK BUT YOU BE DOIN THAT
You claim Im selling crack but you be doin that
YOU CLAIM IM SELLING CRACK BUT YOU BE DOIN THAT
You know the cops they got a network for the toxic rock
You claim Im selling crack but you be doin that
So get that flashlight out of my face
YOU CLAIM IM SELLING CRACK BUT YOU BE DOIN THAT
The Last Emperor KRSOne and Big Zack
Need I say the CIA be Criminals In Action
Cocaine crack unpackin high surveillance trackin
Prominant blacks and whites givin orders for mass slaughters
I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters
When they flooded the streets with crack cocaine
I was like Noah now they lower cause the whole cold war is over
Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbin it
All the assault and batterin in the name of intelligence gatherin
Now its karma you battlin a losin fight
I chose the mic to recite ignite light in the night aight
We should beat em President Clinton should delete em
Its not hard the CIA simply has no more job
Oh my Goddess mother you can fix this
We rock over mixes not six six sixes
Yo this is the message to all that can hear it
If you got secret information nows the time to share it
Call your Congresswoman your senator your mayor
Its time for all the scholars to unite with all the players
Rearrangin see times are definitely changin G
They used to tap the phone now they tapping while you paging me
Its crazy B yet its plain to see who the enemy
Whos left the NRA The ATF the AMA
Okay okay its all irrelevant cause in the new millennium
Therell be no Central Intelligence
Uh yea uh yea
Throw your hands up
You know whassup kid throw your hands up
Ha hah yeah hah hah yeah
