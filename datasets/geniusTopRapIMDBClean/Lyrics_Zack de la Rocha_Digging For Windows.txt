Fuck that bright shit
The spot or the flashlights
We in LA ducking both
In the shadows with lead pipes
The days is all night
All night
See if I pay Edison
No medicine
These blues aint more better when
My fever rise in the jungle
As quick as the price spikes
Days is all night
Yeah they all night
The future snapped like a rubber band
Off my fold on a hand to hand
He drew from his waist
Put two in his roof
And I can still hear his screams
All night
These days is all night
Now they ride their portfolios
Like rodeos
Rise every time my cherry glows
On the end of my cig as
The smoke blows through the bars
And the COs laugh fades
As he strolls away
Says I gotta pay
Off that roll away
Or its fuck your visitation days
So I pop off so in solitaire
I dream of offing these Fred Astaires
And the skin off my fingers tear
Yeah we digging for windows here
Where the days is all night
All night
This citys a trap my partner
Under the lights of they choppers
Bodies tools for they coffers
Not worth the cost of our coffins
Stare at a future so toxic
No trust in the dust of a promise
Wont mark the name on a ballot
So they can be free to devour our options
And just like you Im a target
Ill defined by the guap in my pocket
And the stage make figures
As quick as it off em
What Marley and Pac get
I put these caps in capitals
Leave minds blazed in they capitols
I step with a fury so actual fact
That my offense could be capital

All night
All night
All night
All all night
All night
We digging for windows here
We digging for windows here
All night
We digging for windows here
We digging for windows here
