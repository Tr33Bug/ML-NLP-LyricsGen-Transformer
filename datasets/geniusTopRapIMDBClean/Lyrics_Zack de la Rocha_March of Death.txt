Rock and roll music is the main weapon
Check
One two
Alright bust it
I was born with the voice of a riot a storm
Lightning the function the form
Far from the norm wont follow like cattle
Im more like a catalyst calm in the mix of battle
Who let the cowboy on the saddle He dont know a missile from a gavel
Para terror troopin flippin loops of death upon innocent flesh
But Im back in the cipher my foes and friends
With a verse and a pen against a line I wont toe or defend
Instead I curse at murderous men in suits of professionals who act like animals
Man child ruthless and wild
Who gonna chain this beast back on the leash
This Texas Fhrer for sure a compassionless con usurper
Lethal needle to the poor The cure for crime is murder
Well I was born with the voice of a riot a storm
Lightning the function the form
Far from the norm wont follow like cattle
Im more like a catalyst calm in the mix of battle
Who let the cowboy on the saddle He dont know a missile from a gavel
On the left on the left left right left 
But its just a march of death 
Okay youre lookin good you might bend just a little left just a little left about 170
I read the news today oh boy a snap shot of a midnight ploy
Vex the powerless devour my hours Im motionless with no rest
Cause the scream now holds the sky under another hightech driveby
A lie is a lie is a God
A governments a condor of war nothing more
Islam peace Islam stare into my eyes brother please off our knees
To beef now we feed their disease interlocked our hands across seas
What is a flag is a rag is a shroud out loud outside a faceless crowd
A cowering child just took her last breath one snare  one snare  in the march of death
On the left on the left left right left 
But its just a march of death 
Here it comes the sound of terror from above
He flex his Texas twisted tongue
The poor lined up to kill in desert slums
For oil that boil beneath the desert sun
Now we spit flame we flip this game
All the targets are taking aim
All targets are taking aim
Were the targets theyre taking aim
