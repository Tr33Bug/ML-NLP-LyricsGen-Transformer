There they are now
The master of law
Throwing flowers on a casket of our broken dreams
Most thieves are silent
But these ones scream
These ones scream
We want it all
We want it all
I heard you talkin my friend
I think you lost your mind
That somebodys listenin
And then biding their time
Somebodys watchin
Cause we wouldnt fight
For someone elses war
Could you hold on a second
For a second someones at my door
Screaming hate is love
And fiction is fact
Honesty is deceit
That silence is security
And war is peace
Cause we want it all
We want it all
