3515,I tell you there are no big shots in reality yall Were all in the same boat dealing with the same issues same problems same stuff Dont even buy it All the perpetration you know all this We dont have problems Thats a lie Thats a lie I know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that hes doing to everybody else I just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation See we always thought it was retreat you know run away And Im telling you you got to confront it This is a strange song because this song when this song was written this is when everything sort of stopped It was written a long time ago but it was right before God just snatched me out of everything And because I didnt understand Initially it was written Id written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation when it first happened And I went to the studio and I laid it down And it was like strong for the first day And then it just regressed everyday after that And I said Whats going on Whats happening And at the end of it there was a word that i used rebel And I guess was afraid It was such a hot time in the city at that point I was afraid that if I Put the record out people would misunderstand what I meant by rebel and theyd just take it to the streets So I was very intimidated and afraid And before I knew it a whole host of things happened Everything stopped after that And the creativity stopped Everything stopped Thats when I realized I had to understand what I was talking about before I could tell somebody else what I was talking about And I had to be you know a living example Its real crazy because I dont know what the press is saying because I dont listen to the press too much But I know the view is that Im emotionally unstable which is reality Like you arent Im laughing because what Ive realized Ive become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first you see to make sure that they work And thats when you know OK look I got something that works You know what Im saying Im not gonna give you something that I havent tested for myself And you go through and youre learning by way of experience and youre making mistakes and youre getting up A friend of mine once said to me he said Look if we werent supposed to turn around why does a car have a steering wheel Are we just supposed to crash into the wall No were supposed to say Listen I was going the wrong way Reverse In this particular song now I realize that this song is about freedom You see We could look at one human being but its about the spirit of freedom being taken out and how its taken out in all of us The song is called I Find It Hard to Say Bear with me a little bit ,and how its taken out in all of us The song is called I Find It Hard to Say Bear with me a little bit,I tell you there are no big shots in reality yall Were all in the same boat dealing with the same issues same problems same stuff Dont even buy it All the perpetration you know all this We dont have problems

5212,Hope Remix Lyrics I wish the way I was livin could stop Servin rocks knowin the cops is hot when Im on the block And I wish my brother wouldve made bail So I wont have to travel six hours to see him in jail And I wish that my grandmother wasnt sick Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick I wish And I wish my homies wouldnt have to suffer When the streets get the upper hand understand we lose a brother And I wish I could go deep in the zone And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song I wish And I wish I could teach us all to fly Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold em high And I wish my homie Butch was still alive And on that day of his death we had never took that ride And I wish that God could protect us from the wrong So that all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home And uh we will never break though they devastate We shall motivate and we gotta pray all we got is faith Instead of thinkin about who gon die today The Lord is gon help you feel better so you aint gotta cry today Sit at the light so long And then we gotta move straight forward cause we fight so strong So when right go wrong Just say a lil prayer get your money man life goes on Lets go Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it let it take you away And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way I know it aint easy but thats okay Cause we hopeful I wish that you would show some love Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people comin up I wish I wish I could teach the world to sing Write some music and have them trippin off the joy I bring Shit I wish that we can hold hands Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man I wish And I wish the families that lack but got love Get some stacks brand new shack and a Lac thats on dubs And I wish we could keep achieving wonders See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder I wish You feel me and I hope all the kids eat And dont nobody in my family see six feet ya dig I hope the mothers stand strong You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone I wish And I wish I could give every celly some commissary And no popo bring the heat on our peace like they did R Kelly And I wish that DOC could scream again And bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again Shit then one day they can speak again I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN I wish we could never get the blues Wish that I could bring back the people that died at E2 I wish that we could walk the path stay doin the right thing Hustle hard so them kids maintain up in the game Lets go Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it let it take you away And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way I know it aint easy but thats okay Cause we hopeful Wish the Earth wasnt so apocalyptic I try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it We can make it always be optimistic If you dont listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it I pray for justice when we go to court Wish it was all good so the country never even went to war Why cant we kick it and just get em on And in the famous words of Mister King why cant we all just get along Hope we can find a better way to shop in peace And I hope we find a better way than coppin kis And I wish everybody would just stop and freeze And ask why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies You can be wrong if its you doubtin With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains And only the Heavenly Father can ease the hurt Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church Lets go Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it let it take you away And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way I know it aint easy but thats okay Cause we hopeful Oh Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it let it take you away And be hopeful hopeful and Hell make a way

4752,Now this may sound disgusting and like very gross But its sure to have you trippin so yo listen close Its not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar But its rather on the bug tip and its called Pickin Boogers Now what Im sayin might not be kosher to you But its still somethin we all have to do So go up your nose with a finger or two And pull out one or a crusty crew Yo dont try to front like its so gloomy and gray Cause we all pick our boogers some time every day Whether out in the open or on a sneak tip With a finger tissue or even a QTip Take it from the Biz Markie because Im jokin And also remember this slogan Hey ma whats for dinner Go up your nose and pick a winner Pickin Boogers 4x Let me tell you what happened on the train man I was coolin one day with my partner Kane Headed up to the Rooftop ridin the D train When the man sittin next to me was so profane Hed stick his finger up his nose damn near to his brain You should a moved I was just about but all of a sudden homeboy just pulled out A big green slimy nah Im not neven gonna say it But it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it He sat there for a while with it in his hand So I tried to play cool and like ignore the man So I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap All of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap Now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke But a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked So I dug up my nose and pulled out about five And plucked every last one of them dead in his eye Then the man jumped up and said Whats wrong with you And wiped them off his face and said I cant mess with you Like if I did something that was so full of shame But yo you got to know the name of the game Hmmm Now let me take a trip down memory lane Back in public school with my partner Kane When I was class clown and he was my brother Sittin at the desk pluckin boogers at each other Never doin work as we was supposed Cause we was too busy diggin up our nose And in the lunchroom you would talk about rude God forbid the person thatd leave his food No matter who you are we didnt give a damn We even put teachers down with the program Whether if it was a woman or if you a man We put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand Catch anyone from anywhere But the best fun about it catchin Kane out there Especially when we playin ball in the gym I put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him Now were grown up and things have changed But we still be playin the pickin boogers game Just last night when Kane was gettin ready I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl One night at Latin Quarters I was standin at ease I saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez I didnt show enough that I really did want it So no half steppin I pushed up on it Pulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat Had a spotlight beamin on my Biz Marck hat But when she stepped in the light and she got real close I saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose She was dressed real def and her body was hooked But that dried up booger just ruined her look I wanted to tell her about it but I couldnt be bold So I played if off and said thats a cute green mole I was hopin from that she would wipe it away But she didnt do nothin I guess she wanted it to stay I said before you get my number I dont mean to diss you But write it in your hand because youre gonna need the tissue ,I said before you get my number I dont mean to diss you But write it in your hand because youre gonna need the tissue,Now this may sound disgusting and

Extremities of life and its process Birth of a son death of another With love I caress both mothers And told em whos in control is the one thats above us I walk where money talks and love stutters

5525,Raw Extended Alternate Version LyricsOne two doin a few for you Intro I start to go my rhymesll flow so Get up and dance cause Kane said so If you are loungin around its time to get up Pardon my expression but Imma tear shit up I appear right here and scare and dare A mere musketeer that would dare to compare I do declare Gettin busy is where its at But with what youre sayin you wouldnt get a point for that Cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light But I drop bass just like Barry White So how could you think that you pose a threat You say youre rockin How many shows you get All your vocals go local on the MIC Mines go a great distance like ATT Im not new to this Im true to this nothin you can do to this Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this So yo go for what you know Attempt to debate so I can humiliate We can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse Get you a nurse too late get you a hearse To take you to your burial ground Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down Correct I get respect Im out to collect cash money but thats another subject My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin To sound like me so soon Ill have to open A school of emceein for those who wanna be in My field and court but then again on second thought To have MCs comin out soundin so similar Its quite confusin for you to remember the Originator and boy do I hate a Perpetrator but Im much greater Im A number one second to none A sufficient title for me would be champion Of any event in which I present Fresh lyrics you hear it and mark them excellent Very exquisite and explicit Extraordinaire so what is it Nothin but the finest your supreme Highness Out to diminish delete and minus All rappers thats inferior playin my area Rhymes I recite will make them deteriorate away And just get this straight To compete I will defeat and totally humiliate All imitation with the combination Of rhymes more deadlier than Freddy or Jason Ill be on ya like Robitussin on a cough If you know like I know youd step the hell off On a peaceful eve give me space to breathe The way I be rockin you wouldnt believe Im athletic energetic my rhymes are poetic And while others are pathetic my style is copacetic Innovator dominator rhyme creator My rhymes are food for your party now allow me to cater Cause Im the rappers idol and my title is so vital MCs tryna take it Results are homicidal All MCs try to handle me are led to misfortune and calamity So to whom it may concern please try and learn That in a battle with the Kane you just get burned Cause Im a slayer rhymesayer thats out to kill Progress manifest drop science and build And any rapper tryna stop me from comin through Like Chaka Khan I Feel For You Destruction and corruption is what will occur Much damage bein done as I injure And when I get through rockin the mic like this Youll have to thank the God Almighty if you still exist Like that yall its like that yall And when my Ballys run down I get taps yall So Kool G Rap my mellow my man Get on the mic with the gangsta plan This little note is like a formula the antidote For copycatters I quote they wanna deepthroat Lyrics that I wrote placed upon a beat so neat Orchestras and bands cant compete or compare Or even come near to this here This is a mere affair you just stare and cheer Crystal clear to your ear perhaps some rappers are up there To me theyre just Hollywood Squares Music I create rotates on a plate And I know some people hate me because Im great Got a lot of females cause my records make sales While the others on the shelf is goin slower than snails And this shows the pros are so composed Also enemies and foes to G Rap theyre only zeros Not heroes theyre fractions minus the action of satisfaction Also the brain of the main attraction Im not mixed with any studio tricks No special effects like you see in the flicks Im dramatic so there you have it Im fantastic Competitors are plastic stretch em like elastic Then grab the microphone And create a relaxin tone like a saxophone If you dont like it then use the exit to hell with it Im Kool G Rap and I made it I did it Mission completed suckers are defeated I sweated and bleeded but yet I succeeded So please be aware that this is a war If the shoe fits wear it cause thats what its made for My metaphors are excellent yours are poor My literature will score more for sure The creature feature searcher preacher teacher Torture rupture capture rapture reach ya Musical master rhyme reacts as a Brain that has the knowledge of NASA Youre just a KitKat small as a TicTac But Im a Big Mac cause Im G Rap Well equipped with a hiphop lip My memory bank is like a microchip My bassll give a shake of an earthquake Itll make you sucker MC wanna jump in the lake Cause Im murder homicide comma Crush kill destroy with excitement and drama Speaker sound seeker you become weaker My art is a smoker your material is mediocre The rap Olympia devastate the area Im gettin brainier lyrical mania Power source energy enforced Your headboards will need Red Cross So come one or two step through a few Doubles and couples and Ill cripple all triples huh You cant handle it None or any one or many some or plenty Cause Im not a stranger just the rhyme arranger Highly explosive keep out danger Packin Gs while you try to be me But for these MCs I call em the wannabe Gs What I write is in the smokin section Heres an injection of rap perfection So what the heck You select my dialect Next mans cassette yo reject and eject Cause I could use a technique modern or antique Beats never repeat show you that I can speak Totally properly but rappers wanna copy me This takes strategy just like Monopoly Figure it out Kool G Rap is about makin armies and crews look like Girl Scouts Cause when I start rappin I keep the people clappin Suckers that be yappin dont think that this can happen ,crews look like Girl Scouts Cause when I start rappin

slow down when in traffic In order for me to grow I had to let go of some habits And its easy to say Im on now cause you see it and it happened But before it ever did had to believe and get it cracking So Im gon take you back then 32 shots in my mack 10 With a dream minus the means my early teens was fucking tragic And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you cant imagine That I wrestle with at night demons that I fight I cant get past it So no matter how straight your cash get It dont matter if you plastic We was looking for the lights and all we stumbled across was flashes But

Playboy Bunnies up in the clubs But I only trust the homies that know me now show me love Lets Talk About Sex quiet as kept we all Xrated The flesh make it hard to resist I cant take it But Im only human on a quest to find a horny woman Lonely enough to ball with me Seis Tone and Cuban We run trains like Amtraks orally remove your Tampax To show you how a real man acts I aint embarassed but I aint ready for no baby carriage Especially if the date is average and I aint a savage We be at it like jackrabbits Im a Kraftmatic So catch your breath if you asthmatic Let me backstab it with my magic wand ask your moms If Long Dong can fuck with Don Juan its on Got my jaw right on top of your spine relaxin your mind Im top of the line so its not gonna slime Its not just a rhyme precious its my pleasure Its just another day in the hood for me and my niggas My niggas Chorus Aiyyo I want it all you could call me greedy or superficial Long as my crews official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle Im tryin to triple a million and split it three ways Joe the God full eclipsin myself thatll be the day I need a way to get it already got the ambition Start the ignition watch for the NARCs in the marked expedition Im on a mission which requires a higher position Desire efficient used the fire inside of me glistenin And Im infinite like math so Im gonna last Whatchu wanna laugh all day bullshittin sittin on your ass Im all about the cash and the power I stash with the powder The dash like hittin ass for an hour lets get it locked I want a watch with baguetted rocks So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops Forget the cops we got digits and Glocks too Ready to rock whoever tryin to stop my cheddar from stockin forever Chorus Its hard holdin on singin the words to the same song Remainin strong through the storm but the rain is long The pain is gone only when I sleep But even then when Im in it deep I dream that Im bein beat I seen the beast take life and say he had a knife The truth was he had a wife who never even had a fight Its paradise for some and hell for others they tell us They love us long as we kill our brothers and stay out the suburbs These motherfuckers think we dumb and blind but there come A time in life when I gotta fight for what is mine So Ima shine summertime hard feel me rhyme God Alter your light table like a tripod its type

dying keep the fire burning no not dying Im tryin ta Theres no suicide like the lie that you tell yourself and believe it Mask look decent face is weeping underneath it Selfhate feasting on our deepest darkest secrets Warning signs that read help needed too ashamed to seek it Seems so easily deleted when youre browsing But cant erase the history of what your eyes allowed in The intimately profound ecstasy that gives lifes Stripped of all its meaning til it eats you from the inside The big lie you just do this to get you through the slim times One click at a time til you prefer the counterfeit kind Seen so many scenes that it would seem youre desensitized Just to get your fix you begin dipping into the sick side Seeking to feed a demon that you no longer recognize If you swear it off youll never find a place you can hide Inside your pocket lies a portal to your inner battle Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple Dark places I would play I watch the night

be shown infinite You watch the porn get savager Box office movies nastier the TV gettin trashier School girls are flashing the camera Profile pic look just like the next amateur Babies get exposed no ones controlling how it damage them You find yourself detaching retreating reacting Deep anger decreased passion and you keep lashing out Your sweet family reminds you of your weak habits You have no mercy for yourself and so youre relapsing Your sweet attraction used to drive you to that deep connection Youre feeling so cold and lonely when you least expect it Atop your desk sits a portal to your inner battle Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple Dark places I would play I watch the night turn into day Screaming voices in my mind Leave me cold and so hard to find Thank God those demons didnt last Dealing with the wreckage of my past Not dying I keep the fire burning No not dying Im trying to keep it Now that I have died I have no taste for life Or the affairs of the living Only for love and the affair of the lovers The affairs of the living are many and assorted The affair of the lovers is singular and complete Do not mourn this walking carcass Some are dead because they are without life Others are dead because they are beyond life Yet others have forgotten the affair of life and death altogether ,dead because they are without life Others are dead because

5600,The concept of reverse racism is flawed if not absolutely ridiculous Most if not all of the negative responses from people of color toward white people are reactions to the hatred violence cruelty and brutality that they were shown by white people for centuries Much of the foundation of the modern world was built on the forced free labor of black peoples The African Slave Trade the institution of slavery colonialism its derivative systems and the multiple holocausts throughout history where whites used race as the defining reason to justify their oppression conquest and brutal treatment of nonwhite peoples are how race became such a factor to begin with The initial claim by the oppressors followed a moral imperative so they said that people outside of Occidental and European birth were in savage and cursed conditions and that God justified the captivity of these people and the rape and pillage of their lands Ironically these oppressors would try to discard this same God who supposedly justified this brutality in the name of Darwin whose famous line survival of the fittest was used to justify criminal behavior once the Bible could no longer be used as a hiding place for economic domination and evil intention Spirituality and morality were replaced by capitalism and with it a conscious shift of focus toward the exploitation of the vulnerable In order to justify reverse racism one would have to first create an even playing field undo the generations of torture terror and brutality and then judge whether or not a nonwhite person is in fact a racist This approach would require people to examine the needaddiction to feel superior to someone else for no justifiable reason and the myriad policies Spiritual political and social that it bore True dominion is self evident and not the result of sabotaging another in order to achieve it That would be an illegitimate as well as a fleeting position The Universe will eventually seek to rightbalance itself Of course there are white people who live transcendent lives not exploiting illgotten privilege or perpetuating the sins of their ancestors who used violence and deceit as a means to gain advantage over others Humanity in proper order is obligated to acknowledge the Truth whoever it comes from be they Black White or other Righteous indignation is simply a response to longstanding evil Much of the world is still reeling from the abuses of Imperialist selfishness misunderstanding ignorance and greed Black people remain in many ways a shattered community disenfranchised forcefully removed from context and still caged in denied from making truly independent choices and experiencing existential freedom Their natural homes just like their natural selves raped and pillaged of the resources and gifts God has given to them Interpreted through someone elses slanted lens and filter they remain in many ways misrepresented Taxation without proper representation might I remind you was the very platform of protest that began the Revolutionary War which gained this country its independence from England Anger is not only the natural response to the abuse of power but is also appropriate when there is no real acknowledgment of these abuses or deep meaningful and profound change If we took all of what we deem horrible regarding the criminal abuses that black people have committed over this countrys history and add it all up it still does not compare to the hundreds of years of terrorism violent domination theft rape abuse captivity and beyond that black people have suffered under the ideologies and systems of white supremacy racism and slave based paradigms I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse How then does the chief offender become the judge Might does not necessarily mean right Right is right People forcibly reduced to subhuman existences so that they behave in subhuman ways helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity People like plants grow where the light is When you enclose a plant and limit its light source it will bend itself toward the light for the light is necessary for its survival This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them survival then forces them to twist andor bend toward the only way of escape There is good And I both acknowledge and encourage the good Instead of throwing out the Baby with the bath water we do well to expose the intentionally poisoned water the Baby has been forced to soak in since its origin in these lands Americas particular brand of hypocrisy is gross double entendre I shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term make the IRS whole make the IRS whole knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities The entire time I thought who has made black people whole Who has made recompense for stealing imposing lying murdering criminalizing the traumatized taking them against their wills destroying their homes dividing their communities trying to steal their destinies their time stagnating their development I could go on and on Has America or any of the nations of the world guilty of these atrocities ever made black people or Africa whole or do they continue to sit on them control them manipulate them cage them rob them brutalize them subject them to rules that dont apply to all Use language veiled coercion and psychological torment like invisible fences to keep them locked into a pattern of limitation and therefore control by others You have to remain focused to cease from rage The prosecutor who was a woman made a statement during sentencing about me not doing any charity work for a number of years during my exile A Charity work is not a requirement but something done because someone wants to I was clearly doing charitable works way before other people were even thinking about it And B Even the judge had to comment that she meaning I was both having and raising children during this period As if that was not challenging enough to do She sounded like the echo of the grotesque slave master who expected women to give birth while in the field scoop the Baby up and then continue to work Disgusting When you are beaten and penalized for being independent or truly self reliant then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with selfreliance and a fear of true independence When you are beaten or threatened with death for trying to read a book then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with education When families are broken up by force and threat of violence then the family structure becomes dysfunctional When men who would naturally defend their women and families are threatened with castration and death then this natural response also becomes dysfunctional When looking at the oppressor is punishable by violence then examination of him and his system becomes a difficult and taboo thing to do despite every bone in your body demanding it When questioning or opposing oppression is punishable by death imprisonment or economic assassination then opposing systemic wrong in any or all of its meta manifestations is a terrifying concept Anyone forced to live so incredibly diametrically opposed to that which is natural to themselves will end up in crisis if they dont successfully find a way to improve or transcend these circumstances All of which require healing It is only by the Grace of God and the resilience of the people that things havent been worse Much of my music if not all of it is about Love a therapeutic resolve created in response to the lack of messages encouraging people like me toward free moral agency Helping to ameliorate this condition has never been addressed through the political arena alone It is a sacrificial work that doesnt simply happen between the hours of 9 to 5 or Monday through Friday but when inspiration leads us to avail ourselves for the Truth that needs to be said Unlike the system too often contrarily demonstrates we believe that people can be and should be helped and that trauma should not be criminalized but acknowledged healed and dealt with This takes awareness sensitivity and a level of freedom in my opinion the system lacks And if we dont know or understand how to do it then we humbly refer to a higher authority We have no desire to create humanoids turn people into machines or dumb them down so that they remain dependent longer than necessary to an antiquated system in denial of its many inadequacies and need to evolve Instead we seek to educate and shed light on the snares traps and enticements that people set up in the name of business that are intended only to catch the sleeping andor uninformed Why would a system well intentioned wait until breakdown or incarceration to consider rehabilitation after generations of institutionally inflicted trauma and abuse on a people To me it is obvious that the accumulation of generational trauma and abuse have created the very behaviors the system tries to punish by providing no sufficient outlets for the victims of institutional terror Clearly the institution seeks to hide its own criminal history at the expense and wholeness of the abused who acting out from years of abuse and mistreatment reflect the very aggression that they were exposed to ,the expense and wholeness of the abused who acting out

5442,Ordinary Love Shit 4 Running Away Lyrics Tell me how long are we suppose to act like this We wont never get on track like this How can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this You call me over here to talk and I get attacked like this Its funny Got your track shoes on but what you running from Shit I know where you going and where you coming from Thats immaturity showing its just the baby in you One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you Tired of hearing how youll never trust me again How you love me then you hate me then you love me again One minute Im your soulmate then its fuck me again Until you get horny enough and wan fuck me again but check it I just wan treat you good and do better You think Im running round tryna be the hoods Hugh Heffner Say Im all about

doing you So what the fuck is me doing me have to do witchu How dare you tell me its tougher for you Like I dont hear about them niggas you fucking with too Id never knew you thought like that dammit Who knew you was into sports like that More prayers because they all players You out there having a ball player ball player after ball player I mean you with the ball players more than ball players Hope they aint fucking you and making you they ballplayer Come to me I just get a hard time Why they give one to you is this what you wan do With me you get an attitude you get all stuck up Start calling me a fuck up till I tell you shut the fuck up Yeah but the part I dont respect is You so cool with every other one of your exes Its history between us all aint right either Back and forth domestic all aint flights either Be wanting you close to me supposedly You say you over me that just comes across as a joke to me Cause you aint got the kind of love that expires Worst case youll get tired tell your friends Im a liar Tried therapy when we felt it going sour Thats fourhundred dollars every hour For him to come and mediate referee be our interpreter Tell me I need to lower my voice dont curse at her Says shes only frustrated cause I keep hurtin her Tell me despite all that he can tell that I worship her Soon as you let your guard down I get it up again Fixing it is too much work so I give up again But I wan spend the rest of my life with you Make a wife with you make it alright with you But how are you ever suppose to think that Im right for you When all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable Disgraceful and you want me to chase you But its easier for me to replace you cause I see it like If you cant deal with what we go through I got bitches lined up I got a ego too And to them Im everything funny Im great and Im charming But to you Im alarming all I do is bring harm in To you Im the cause of all your misery Of course I disagree you going off our history All that arguing just aint my style Cause that anger now got us like strangers now You tell me I should get help and Im sick in the head You found makeup on the sheets I had a bitch in our bed But wait I aint love her though I aint fuck her though I could dead that bitch right now man fuck that hoe You just think Ill get another and another hoe Way you talk to me its like I got a whole club of hoes But I could switch gears make em all disappear You going through my phone like I got a bitch in there We discussing chicks after they through They dont matter to me but for some reason they matter to you We keep having the same threesome But not the kind that come as a blessing nah You keep bringing up my last girl like she aint my past girl Like you aint the reason she present check it You aint gotta worry about me and her If I wanted to be with her I would be with her Yeah we hung together strip clubs had fun together But thats done dont sweat her uh You the only one I wanna do a bid with Live

love me unconditionally Nineyears in I dont deserve what you giving me Like you get a victory by acting like a dick to me Want me to see how it feels I get the trickery Lesson learned though you my missing piece Give another chance to your ex You dont pick up the phone you dont answer my texts Bitch we aint give it all that we got Still aint empty the clip lets give it one more shot Or we can go

5363,TranslationsTrkeItaliano America Ha ha ha We love you How many people are proud to be citizens Of this beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars For the rights that men have died for to protect The women and men who have broke their necks For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to upholdÂ or so were told Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song I never wouldve dreamed in a million years Id see So many motherfuckin people who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs Its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me So many lives I touched so much anger aimed In no particular direction just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days Who wouldve thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair With some peroxide reachin for a tshirt to wear That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this How could I predict my words would have an impact like this I mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep tellin me I aint causin nothin but problems And now theyre sayin Im in trouble with the government Im lovin it I shoveled shit all my life and now Im dumpin it on White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself If they were brown Shadyd lose Shady sits on the shelf But Shadys cute Shady knew Shadys dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby Ooh baby  Look at my sales Lets do the math If I was black I wouldve sold half I aint have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that But I could rap so fuck school Im too cool to go back Give me the mic Show me where the fuckin studios at When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up I was like Fuck it until I met Dre the only one to look past Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got Was probly his in exchange for every white fan that hes got Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow Im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now Its  White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids Who otherwise wouldve never knew these words exist Whose moms probly wouldve never gave two squirts of piss Til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence Straight out the tube right into your livin rooms I came And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope Waitin to choke tightenin around my throat Watchin me while I write this like I dont like this note All I hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy Sponsors workin round the clock to try to stop my concerts early Surely hiphop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom So now Im catchin the flak from these activists when they raggin Actin like Im the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit Just look at me like Im your closest pal The poster child the motherfuckin spokesman now for White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America I am the Derringer Aimed at little Erica to attack her character The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress And piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the galf and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy Fuck you Ms Cheney Fuck you Tipper Gore Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have Fuck you Ha ha ha Im just playin America You know I love you,speech this Divided States of

beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars For the rights that men have died for to protect The women and men who have broke their necks For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to upholdÂ or so were told Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song I never wouldve dreamed in a million years Id see So many motherfuckin people who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs Its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me So many lives I touched so much anger aimed In no particular direction just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days Who wouldve thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair With some peroxide reachin for a tshirt to wear That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this How could I predict my words would have an impact like this I mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep tellin me I aint causin nothin but problems And now theyre sayin Im in trouble with the government Im lovin it I shoveled shit all my life and now Im dumpin it on White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself If they were brown Shadyd lose Shady sits on the shelf But Shadys cute Shady knew Shadys dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby Ooh baby Look at my sales Lets do the math If I was black I wouldve sold half I aint have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that But I could rap so fuck school Im too cool to go back Give me the mic Show me where the fuckin studios at When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up I was like Fuck it until I met Dre the only one to look past Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got Was probly his in exchange for every white fan that hes got Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow Im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now Its White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids Who otherwise wouldve never knew these words exist Whose moms probly wouldve never gave two squirts of piss Til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence Straight out the tube right into your livin rooms I came And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope Waitin to choke tightenin around my throat Watchin me while I write this like I dont like this note All I hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy Sponsors workin round the clock to try to stop my concerts early Surely hiphop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom So now Im catchin the flak from these activists when they raggin Actin like Im the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit Just look at me like Im your closest pal The poster child the motherfuckin spokesman now for White America I could be one of your kids White America Little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah White America I could be one of your kids White

attitude Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker Your style is smooth even for a cheating mic You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim soundalike Heres a Milkbone a sign of recognition Dont turn away I think you should listen close Dont boast you said you wasnt bragging You fucking liar youre chasin a chuckwagon The only way you learn you have to be taught That if a beat is not for sale then it cant be bought When you leave the mic you claim its smoking Unlike Rakim you are a joke And I think you ought to stop before you get in too deep Cause with a sister like Lyte yo I dont sleep Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker When Im in a jam with my homegirl Jill My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls So I step in the middle shake it just a little Wait for some female to step up and pop junk Give my cousin a cue treat the girl like a punk Now Im not trying to say that Im into static But yo if you cause it yep we gotta have it Cause I aint going out like a sucker no way So I sit around the way for you to make my day We can go for the hands better yet for the words Cause youll be ignored and at the same time Ill be heard Throughout the city the town and the country The beat is funky my rhyme is spunky There is no delaying in the rhyme Im saying Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing So sit back Jack and listen to this its 10 dis Cause Im just about ready to fly this fist against your lips But Ill wait for the day or night that you approach And Imma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble Your skin just crumble a battles no trouble Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid This thing called hiphop Lyte is ruling it I hate to laugh in your face but youre funny Your beat your rhyming your timing all crummy On the topic of rapping I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet Your rap is weak homegirl and its definitely crooked Others write your rhymes while I write my own I dont create a character when Im on the microphone I am myself no games to be played No script to be written no scene to be made I am the director as far as you are concerned You dont believe me then youll have to learn This aint as hard as MC Lyte can get Matter of fact you aint seen nothing yet So never let me step into a party hardy Talk to some people and then hear from somebody You wanna battle cause you know where I am You dont wanna come in the 90s and see me at a jam When a mic is handy ten feet away I stretch my arm like elastic hand like a magnet Set assure you know I dont play When it comes down to it the nitty gritty For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker Beat biter

this is what you do You put your left foot up and then your right foot next Follow instructions dont lose the context Thirty days a month your mood is rude We know the cause of your bloody attitude Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker Your style is smooth even for a cheating mic You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim soundalike Heres a Milkbone a sign of recognition Dont turn away I think you should listen close Dont boast you said you wasnt bragging You fucking liar youre chasin a chuckwagon The only way you learn you have to be taught That if a beat is not for sale then it cant be bought When you leave the mic you claim its smoking Unlike Rakim you are a joke And I think you ought to stop before you get in too deep Cause with a sister like Lyte yo I dont sleep Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker Beat biter dope style taker Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker When Im in a jam with my homegirl Jill My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls So I step in the middle shake it just a little Wait for some female to step up and pop junk Give my cousin a cue treat the girl like a punk Now Im not trying to say that Im into static But yo if you cause it yep we gotta have it Cause I aint going out like a sucker no way So I sit around the way for you to make my day We can go for the hands better yet for the words Cause youll be ignored and at the same time Ill be heard Throughout the city the town and the country The beat is funky my rhyme is spunky There is no delaying in the rhyme Im saying Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing So sit back Jack and listen to this its 10 dis Cause Im just about ready to fly this fist against your lips But Ill wait for the day or night that you approach And Imma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble Your skin just crumble a battles no trouble Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid This thing called hiphop Lyte is ruling it I hate to laugh in your face but youre funny Your beat your rhyming your timing all crummy On the topic of rapping I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet Your rap is weak homegirl and its definitely crooked Others write your rhymes while I write my own I dont create a character when Im on the microphone I am myself no games to be played No script to be written no scene to be made I am the director as far as you are concerned You dont believe me then youll have to learn This aint as hard as MC Lyte can get Matter of fact you aint seen nothing yet So never let me step into a party hardy Talk to some people and then hear from somebody You wanna battle cause you know where I am You dont wanna come in the 90s and see me at a jam When a mic is handy ten feet away I stretch my arm like elastic hand like a magnet Set assure you know I dont play When it comes down to it the nitty gritty For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity Beat biter dope style taker Tell you

4032,Okay so it might appear To an outsider that you found your way up out of here Theyre saying you died of suicide Thats the last thing I want to hear They tell me that its hardly fair to blame myself What a hell of a cross to bare You didnt say it in your letter But the fact that I failed you is loud and clear Found out the amount of fear You would drown when you found yourself naked staring down a mirror And partners are supposed to lay the cards bare I left you playing solitaire and I promise you that Im sincere If youre looking for some judgment you wont find it here Lets be honest here I cant say Ive never known that kind of despair When the clouds appear hows life fair I just want to draw you near Not to make it about me but how could you check out Before you really allowed me a chance to sit down and hear I think I wouldve listened Or were you saying it all along and I just missed it You sang your swan song we all dismissed it Because you filled the room with laughter I watched when you thought no one was looking at you In hind sight I wonder where your smile went When the party ended and you swallowed it I saw you swallow it Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here How many cries soak through your disguise Before you drown in your silent tears Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here How many times can you

everything is slow motion no matter how fast its happening Every second that pass stretches so that you can watch it unraveling But cant always react to it Your whole life might flash before your eyes The minute when you transition to the other side But what can actually happen in that time Inbetween the leaping and the moment you collide Inbetween the trigger and the blast Inbetween you let go of the wheel and you crash Inbetween the moment when you swallow the last pill in the bottle Turn out the lights roll the dice on tomorrow Is there a moment to reflect can there be regret Is there a wait not yet let me reset Or is it just too painful to accept That maybe death just seemed best Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here If you not winning you can go down swinging Even if it doesnt feel like theyre fighting fair Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here Im trying not to resent you But you left me defenseless in the life we share Every man before me in my fam died by his own hands How am I supposed to understand my own role in the plan When nobody who grows old stands a chance What about this mysterious dance Made you cut the cord to the curtain in advance But these are questions I can only ask The person looking back in the looking glass ,you cut the cord to the curtain in advance But these are questions I can only ask The person

the paper cause its all a part of me Be it a song or a casual conversation To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations Your words once heard they can place you in a faction My words may disturb but at least theres a reaction Oh yeah oh oh yeah Sometimes I wanna kill sometimes I wanna die Sometimes I wanna destroy sometimes I wanna cry Sometimes I could get even sometimes I could give up

into our conscious thoughts you tell me whos to blame  I know you dont wanna hear me cryin And I know you dont wanna hear me deny That your satisfaction lies in your illusion But your delusions are

intentions can you find the missing link Your only validation is living your own life Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time So I send this song to the offended I said what I meant and Ive never pretended As so many others do intending just to please If I damned your point of view could you turn the other cheek Oh Dont damn me when I speak a piece of mind Cause silence isnt golden when Im holding it inside Cause Ive been where Ive been and Ive seen what I have seen I put the pen to the paper cause its all a part of me Dont damn me I said dont damn me I said dont hail me Ah dont damn

5468,Yall dont know me Honestly I cant say that I blame yall I dont even really know myself But yall probably shouldnt know me Last thing Im tryna be is the good guy now I aint never gave a fuck why should I now Like the worlds interrupting my song with an interlude Cant yall see Im busy trying to balance out my chemical Finishing up what yall aint even begin to do When your backs against the ropes its either him or you Yall aint so important that my words are meant for you When did eybody become so sensual Caught up in the hesay shesay blog sites Him and her broke up WorldStar Nahright Dumb fans they believe everything that yall write Found out friends fake couldnt even facade right Pressures on wont fail nigga got too much to prove Wouldve been lost it but I got too much to lose Say what you want about Joe but I stood my ground Bitch I get it up myself you just put it down They say I put my whole life on display to my dismay Stop it youre carrying on without logic Let me tell you this about Joe I only say what I want you to hear Youll only see what I want to show Crushing up the Percocet chasing the high Talli I couldnt make this shit up if I tried The forecast shows a downpour Yall just made God cry praying for my Downfall This shit Im talking bout right here Let me tell you niggas something You can be anything in this world that you want Except for my downfall Im a victim of society circumstance or just feelings Was a nigga victimized Or just willing No blinds no bags just dealing No foundation or floor plan just building Check it nights bright but the days dark Covered in tattoos but hate art These eggshells I walk on are razor sharp Staring at the finish line looking for a way to start Ive been called everything an extremist Is that a bad thing or what they really mean is Anything a nigga do a nigga mean it And I wont let a person place or thing come between it An opportunist is how they paint me But if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me Still I feel like my problems are great Shit if I dont never solve em Im straight On the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate So he had to figure I wouldnt be bothered by the weight Im trying to change the pattern but its on loop Even an outcast in my own group Whats it mean when eybody standing next to you expects of you Everything that comes wit a spectacle If everywhere I go I just leave behind residue Tell me trust me I wont think nothing less of you Im sorry I aint around more Come up with me or stay on the ground floor I dont need shelter from the downpour Yall can be whatever you want just not my downfall They tryna make me slow tryna take me no Cant be my downfall They tryna knock my grind I wont stop Im fine Cant be my downfall No moment of clarity The next fight showing is a rarity Severity in me against my growin popularity Rappers wont rap Im forced to believe they scared of me But can no longer use the scape goat They not aware of me So yall can go and throw your little pot shots Some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot Im getting my head right recollecting Yall looking for some website resurrection Being that I got too much to lose Or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that Im accused No longer amused affected my loved ones Now they startin to bruise And I dont want no parts of that abuse Wouldnt wish upon my worst foe a day in my shoes Thatll just eliminate any excuse And why entertain em Old me woulda lost my senses yall just helping the new me regain em Been punched in the face It was either feed my family or hunt wit the 38 I aint want brunch to wait Ive out grown HipHop it turned into a DayCare So next time some shit is on my mind itll stay there Im staring at the man in the mirror But it aint helping see the man any clearer So I get MIA from around yall Till God stops answering these prayers for my downfall Tell me what am I to do If I aint have a soul a nigga always had you pardon due But I gotta speak candidly How the FUCK could you abandon me Wit 5 years of blood sweat and tears But it was obviously a disconnect We turned that into a disrespect Said she been holding it inside for years shes unhappy So the girl I wan marry was afraid to come and tap me So I went away on tour and you went on one of your own But while you was on the horn all day wit ol boy Did you ever think about what it would do to your home Whats his name Wheres he live What is it he offers Whats he got to give And I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs I hit you like a man you wore it in your ribs I was heated But had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see whats underneath it Come to find out you felt lied to and cheated Mistreated and kept it a big secret Or are you just loose And Im so naive Im tryna give you an excuse Now that I refuse to believe we life partners Holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us Cant use anything I ever gave you to bury me You supposed to be the one to bury me You wan leave Then goodbye Think the grass look greener on the other side but its dye ,supposed to be the one to bury me You wan leave Then goodbye Think the grass look greener

4908,Yo man its a lot of brothers out there flakin and perpetratin But scared to kick reality Man youve been doin all this dope producin You aint had a chance to show em what time it is So what you want me to do Express yourself Im expressin with my full capabilities And now Im livin in correctional facilities Cause some dont agree with how I do this I get straight meditate like a Buddhist Im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary But my technique is very necessary Blame it on Ice Cube because he says it gets funky When you got a subject and a predicate Add it on a dope beat and thatll make you think Some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach Cause they dont flow like this one You know what I wont hesitate to diss one or two before Im through So dont try to sing this Some drop science well Im droppin English Even if Yella makes it a cappella I still express yo I dont smoke weed or sess Cause its known to give a brother brain damage And brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin But makin a sucka and you equal dont be another sequel Express yourself Ah ah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah Express yourself Smoke smoke Come on and do it Yeah kick it over here Express yourself Do it do it  Express yourself Come on and do it Now gettin back to the PG Thats program and its easy Dre is back new jacks are made hollow Expressin aint their subject because they like to follow The words the style the trend the records I spin Again and again and again yo you on the other end Watch a brother sayin dope rhymes with no help Theres no fessin and guessin while Im expressin myself Its crazy to see people be What society wants em to be but not me Ruthless is the way to go they know Others say rhymes that fail to be original Or they kill where the hiphop starts Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts Some musicians cuss at home But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone Yeah they want reality but you wont hear none Theyd rather exaggerate a little fiction Some say no to drugs and take a stand But after the show they go lookin for the dopeman Or they ban my group from the radio Hear NWA and say Hell no But you know it aint all about wealth As long as you make a note to  Express yourself Yeah yeah yeah  Express yourself Come on and do it Yeah yeah do it Express yourself Dr Dre Dr Dre in full effect and NWA Express yourself Come on

your record because it has no bottom I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn Its Dre on the mic gettin physical Doin the job NWA is the lynch mob Yes Im macabre but you know you need this

life And after this then Imma find somethin new in life I guarantee it will be somthin that I really love I give thanks for my life to God up above That Im blessed to have a job that I enjoy doin And

his devices those worthless sacrifices Praying to the altar of himself Making pilgrimages thinking hes religious Like hes got all the light and no one else He takes the unsuspected Cause he knows theyre not connected And he shows them how to be just as he is Virtually real and commercially appealed To the lust of all the people where he lives Eve was so naive blinded by the pride and greed Wanting to be intellectual Drifting from the way she got turned down one day And now she thinks that shes bisexual Caught up in emotion Burning up in her devotion To the king of exploitation in the field She handed him her virtue Cause he told her I wont hurt you So she lay with him to see how good it feels Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now Now after the sensation and the empty fornication She brought affection home Into her bed quickly multiplying Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment Cause everything appears to be the same They entertain suggestion Next time just use protection Desiring to cover up their shame But much to their demise poor decision closed their eyes To the very antidote to their dilemma Burning in their lust Both of them adulterous Destroying the original agenda Praying to the sky in order to maintain a lie They exhausted every possible conclusion They cant even entertain the solution In a brain filled with vain information and pollution Hiding from the truth He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation When confronted blamed his wife Giving birth to carnal life Refusing to acknowledge what he done Now if we can agree with who created us to be Who says were guilty everyone before his eyes Making no exceptions since the day of our conception Predisposed to hating truth and loving lies Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now Stop walking in pride let the thief be crucified Unlearn everything you know and let Him teach you Line upon line and precept upon precept say goodbye To this decaying social system He wants to know how far were willing to go If we love him like we say we do He will try us Just you dont regress Or slip into hopelessness Once Hes satisfied His love He wont deny us And then Hell tell us what what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now And then Hell tell us what what we gonna do now Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now ,we gonna say now And then Hell tell us what what we gonna do now Where we gonna go

both their knees Whyd you take him Lord No homeless people gazing up thinking vacant thoughts Brand new condominiums sit where there was a vacant lot And still surrounded by this commerce I feel shaken up Nothing is familiar feels like money took the place of love When I see the old ladies look afraid like they could run At any moment even though me I aint taking nothing Its like this place has lost the essence of the place Im from Went to the barbershop I used to frequent place is run Out of business and everyone I knew is straight just gone Feel I should take the bong and hit it to escape the For feeling that you feel when those empowered take your home That feeling is exactly why I had to write this song It was a place I used to call home I tried to chase the energy but now its all gone And only memories remain I tried to feel the feeling but the city aint the same They say its all to improve But tell me where communities are supposed to move When they been living in the trap And those who make it out are hardly ever giving back Tell me And where do all the people go who cant afford the change They board the train ignore the pain of leaving all that theyve Known all their life the only place theyve lived for all their days Where they learned all their ways and spent a thousand holidays I guess that life is really all about the dollar chase Some move to live with family members or across the state Some disappear and stay anonymous its all a maze These people were pillars that made the hood a stronger place The city lost its soul and gained a lot of hipsters But does that really make it better or a little weirder And will the idea of America come to fruition Or is to push the poor away really the real agenda No jobs poor education some things aint really changing Its time we learn for self and do for self fuck being patient Inflation rises people moving but the rich are staying Sometimes it seems the future plans include a Third World nation It was a place I used to call home I tried to chase the energy but now its all gone And only memories remain I tried to feel the feeling but the city aint the same They say its all to improve But tell me where

aint Cause I cant get caught by authority The camera at the bank got me ganked so they know its me Reached for artillery put the shank in my mouth Dove off the boat to the river and I bailed out Swam

clothes in between spot A and spot C The designated area we call spot B See I cant be broke so I come up with a plan Demand money soon as they hand it over Get up and jet the set The longer you stay the quicker you get arrested MJG tested his strategy Wit a slick armed robbery Eightball Flying through the air on my way to Jamaica Thinking about why I took the money for the sake of Me living poor and wishing to be richer And just like Picasso I had to paint a picture Of people dying rapidly trying to imprison me Just because I took a little money in a robbery Landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads Smoking on the ganja messing with my head The feds came behind me hit me with a billy club I fell to the ground turned around pumping slugs Jumped up quick ditched the gun as I ran away Ran to the hills where I hid for a few days No Im not the one that they will catch soon Bought me a palace in the hills wit a hundred rooms I got the money got the women got the BUD I plead guilty to

airport in a private jet Jumped out of the truck with fast pigs right behind my ass Running trying to shoot my nine holding bags full of cash Jumped on the jet now we set to hit the runway Took to the air yea I got away scottfree Fired up a Mac j pigs didnt catch me Countin all my money from a strong armed robbery MJG You think its over but it aint Cause I cant get caught by authority The camera at the bank got me ganked so they know its me Reached for artillery put the shank in my mouth Dove off the boat to the river and I bailed out Swam like a fish greeted land with a kiss Did I hit or did I miss well it goes like this I put the money in the spot Took the clothes that I got Tied them up in the bag same place I put the mask Changed clothes in between spot A and spot C The designated area we call spot B See I cant be broke so I come up with a plan Demand money soon as they hand it over Get up and jet the set The longer you stay the quicker you get arrested MJG tested his strategy Wit a slick armed robbery Eightball Flying through the air on my way to Jamaica Thinking about why I took the money for the sake of Me living poor and wishing to be richer And just like Picasso I had to paint a picture Of people dying rapidly trying to imprison me Just because I took a little money in a robbery Landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads Smoking on the ganja messing with my head The feds came behind me hit me with a billy club I fell to the ground turned around pumping slugs Jumped up quick ditched the gun as I ran away Ran to the hills where I hid for a few days No Im not the one that they will catch soon Bought me

to a man while he played piano Man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed JJ Fad Uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do

bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel Ima sleep in the front seat Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it lifes handin you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake em a cake then Dont mistake him for Satan Its a fatal

5033,Were here because of you Were here because you were there Weve arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America We were promised a better life in our home countries where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury Some corporations are more efficient than government but their motivation is not the health or the wellbeing of the people its only about profit Everything elsetheir image their human resources their public relationsonly exist to protect the reality behind it Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture by those who never had our interests at heart They didnt care about our survival or wellbeingthey just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land by exploiting our people our industry and our resources They took everything we built and made it theirs first by creating racism to justify slavery building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty everything we had was still owned by them Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God Open your eyes before you die And while some used missionaries and donations to offset this abuse other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes using war disease and sanctions that killed millions They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people because their loyalty was to those who enabled them and stored them and kept them in power They became the bastard children of American industry kleptocracy governments of thievery They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars right wing death squads execute political dissidents sympathetic clergy and even overthrow democratically elected governments And so the age of revolution began again They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market But the free market has never been free because the market does not regulate itself It is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image Destroy the image and the enemy will die Such is the same in the rap industry But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World When they need new assets new artists to prostitute a sideins and put on a shelf to use their songs when they needed new concepts music and publishing to steal from the producers they came to the underground to the Third World They took our culture our property and our industry and our resources even using our own people to help them exploit us But behind the mask of efficiency they claimed that we need them to succeed Theyre no better than us Their economic advertising was always a lie A few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth almost as if it was designed for failure Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture glittering rented jewelry the cars the IMF loans the seeds with suicide genes 20year contracts and oil blood money Build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters Theyll stop at nothing to get what they want They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward But the super powers are no less corrupt theyve just learned to disguise it better cause they fix elections too they embezzle tax money they go to war for resources they fund terrorism for their own benefit And when theres enough at stake historys taught us that theyll even assassinate their own presidents WAKE UP Just as the

4770,Express Yourself Extended Mix Lyrics Dr Dre Yo man theres alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality Ice Cube Yo Dre youve been doin all this dope producin you aint had a chance to show em what time it is Dr Dre So watch do you want me to do All you got to do now express yourself Im expressin with my full capabilities Now Im livin in correctional facilities Cause some dont agree with how I do this I get straight meditate like a Buddhist Im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary But my technique is very necessary Blame it on Ice Cube because he said it gets funky When you got a subject and a predicate Add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think Some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach Cause they dont flow like this one You know what I wont hesitate to dis one or two before Im through So dont try to sing this Some drop science well Im droppin English Even if Yella makes it acapella I still express yo I dont smoke weed or sess Cause its known to give a brother brain damage And brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin But makin a sucker and you equal Dont be another sequel Express yourself Do it good Express yourself Oh do it Ice Cube is not for the pop charts So where should a brother like you start expressin yourself My boyll show you how Yo Dre  What up Drop English right about Now gettin back to the PG Thats program and its easy Dre is back New jacks are made hollow Expressin aint their subject because they like to follow the words The style the trend the records I spin Again and again and again Yo ya on the other end Watch a brother playin dope rhymes with no help Theres no fessin and guessin while Im expressin myself Its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be But not me Ruthless is the way to go they know Others say rhymes that fail to be original Or they kill where the hiphop starts Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts And those musicians curse at home But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone Yeah they want reality but you wont hear none They rather exaggerate a little fiction Some say no to drugs and take a stand But after the show they go lookin for the dope man Oh they ban my group from the radio Hear NWA and say Hell no But you know it aint all about wealth As long as you make a note to express yourself  Express yourself Do it do Express yourself Oh do it A lyricist yo Dre is the name for it To make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for Kickin reality yo but staying hisself But its important to keep it in mind to Express yourself From the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then Expression is big part of it You aint efficient when you flow you aint swift Movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis Theres a little bit more to show I got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo Or a lesson all of them expression And if you start fessin I got a SmithWesson for ya I might ignore your record because it has no bottom I get loose in the Summer Winter Spring and Autumn Its Dre on the mic gettin physical Doin the job NWA is the lynch mob Yes Im macabre but you know you need this And the knowledge is growin just like a fetus Or a tumor but heres the rumour Dres in the neighborhood and hes up to no good When I start expressin myself Yella slam it Cause if I stay funky like this Im doin damage Or Imma be too hyped I need a straight jacket I got knowledge and other suckers lack it So when you see Dre a DJ on the mic Ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight Cause if I strike It aint for your good health But I wont strike if you just express yourself Express Yourself Do it good Express Yourself Oh do it,It aint for your good health But I wont strike if you just express yourself Express Yourself Do it good Express Yourself Oh do it,Express Yourself Extended Mix Lyrics Dr Dre Yo man theres alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality Ice Cube Yo Dre youve been doin all this dope producin you aint had a chance to show em what time it is Dr Dre So watch do you want me to do All you got to do now express yourself Im expressin with my full capabilities Now Im livin in correctional facilities Cause some dont agree with how I do this I get straight meditate like a Buddhist Im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary But my technique is very necessary Blame it on Ice Cube because he said it gets funky When you got a subject and a predicate Add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think Some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach Cause they dont flow like this one You know what I wont hesitate to dis one or two before Im through So dont try to sing this Some drop science well Im droppin English Even if Yella makes it acapella I still express yo I dont smoke weed or sess Cause its known to give a brother brain damage And brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin But makin a sucker and you equal Dont be another sequel Express yourself Do it good Express yourself Oh do it Ice Cube is not for the pop charts So where should a brother like you start expressin yourself My boyll show you how Yo Dre What up Drop English right about Now gettin back to the PG Thats program and its easy Dre is back New jacks are made hollow Expressin aint their subject because they like to follow the words The style the trend the records I spin Again and again and again Yo ya on the other end Watch a brother playin dope rhymes with no help Theres no fessin and guessin while Im expressin myself Its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be But not me Ruthless is the way to go they know Others say rhymes that fail to be original Or they kill where the hiphop starts Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts And those musicians curse at home But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone Yeah they want reality but you wont hear none They rather exaggerate a little fiction Some say no to drugs and take a stand But after the show they go lookin for the dope man Oh they ban my group from the radio Hear NWA and say Hell no But you know it aint all about wealth As long as you make a note to express yourself Express yourself Do it do Express yourself Oh do it A lyricist yo Dre is the name for it To make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for Kickin reality yo but staying hisself But its important to keep it in mind to Express yourself From the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then Expression is big part of it You aint efficient when you flow you aint swift Movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis Theres a little bit more to show I got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo Or a lesson all of them expression And if you start fessin I got a SmithWesson for ya I might ignore your record because it has no bottom I get loose in the Summer Winter Spring and Autumn Its Dre on the mic gettin physical Doin the job NWA is the lynch mob Yes Im macabre but you know you need this And the knowledge is growin just like a fetus Or a tumor but heres the rumour Dres in the neighborhood and hes up to no good When I start expressin myself Yella slam it Cause if I stay funky like this Im doin damage Or Imma be too hyped I need a straight jacket I got knowledge and other suckers lack it So when you see Dre a DJ on the mic Ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight Cause if I strike
5475,Say this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed Hurting my heart and hanging over my head Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred CL Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C The closest homeboy that I ever had Now when we first met we wasnt on the same page From petty misunderstandings that got clearer with age Two young boys who was ready to mash Put PA on the map and maybe make a little cash Jumped down with Bigtyme put down a few songs Everybody cosigned saying that we could do no wrong Then hit the streets with a big ass bang Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang Dropped Tell Me Something Good took off and went live Shit next thing you know we was signing to Jive Dropped Too Hard to Swallow A Pocket Full of Stones Put the remix on Menace shit we had it going on Got love in the streets and played on the air But the homey putting us out wasnt playing too fair Had to separate ourself bring in a new team But sometimes the other side aint always what it seems We dropped Super Tight a album full of killer flows But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes We didnt realize what was happening on the real And new management was cutting back room deals Hiding different money and concealing the price He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice Took a while to catch on to what homey was doing But by the time we did all the paperwork was in ruins Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldnt file taxes The next thing you know IRS hitting us with axes Pimp you owe seven figures Bun you owe six Better get your paper together get this shit fixed Remixed the management team and tried it ourself Cussed out the GM almost got put on the shelf Fuck it dropped Ridin Dirty instant classic in the South Reclaimed the southern title shut everybodys mouth Got some clout in the game boys calling us the greatest But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters The old manager calling and say he fina sue And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do Put a call out to the Prince this nigga still hating We got heat for the streets and we cant keep the people waiting He made a call or two to some folks tellin em man You gotta cut UGK some slack understand Young Pimp got the plan Bun got the drawl RapALot had our back and we just waiting on Jive We got the big bosses on the same page So me and young Pimp went hit em from center stage Next thing you know we got this call from the NY Its JayZ saying yall niggas getting fly He doing Volume 3 and got a track from Timb And wondered could some trill niggas rock it with him Shit big Bun was all for it but Pimp wasnt sure But Big Pimpin hit em 187Pure Number one song on every station you turn on MTV and BET we getting our burn on Grammy nominated cant believe that we made it And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded And it stated that due to the success of the track We here at Jive records would like to piggy back Get another beat from Timb then get a verse from Jay Let Hype shoot the video and well be on the way Shit it sounded okay but me I had to ask If we dont do Big Pimpin 2 would you still put us on blast A song like that would might take a nigga to the top But my true fan base might think a nigga flop They got mad and put niggas on hold For damn near a year till the buzz got cold So we said fuck em and went back to the basics Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix We put Dirty Money together and it was aces But thats around the time that Pimp caught two cases He got probation said fuck you hoes We finish the album got ready to do a couple shows And then he violated one month before we dropped And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped Now 30 days done we back to the nitty gritty Album got released big showdown in Chocolate City Niggas with masks on vests and all black Its Christmas 2001 bitch we was all that Strongest on the block nobody could budge And then he violated now we right back before the judge They calling him a nuisance put my dog behind a fence It was January 28th he aint been home since Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses In stead of coCEO now Im the fuckin boss Had the devil on my back got to drinking and drugging Had to make a choice get back to rapping or thugging So I walked into my bedroom got down on my knees Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please Let me get past this bridge over water thats trouble And get back up on my grind on the double He said son dont worry Cause its not really hard as it seem And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams You just got to stay true to yourself and to C Then push away from the devil and get closer to me And every since that night man I promise I been on it Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it Pimp the pen like never before Im breaking em G Not to mention I got the world screaming Free Pimp C So soon as you make parole and they open the doors You aint gotta worry about nothing the world is yours Aint no mo struggles my nigga and no mo strife I kept it real because to me its UGK for life ,the world is yours Aint no mo struggles my nigga and no mo strife I kept it real because to me its UGK for life,Say this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said Wake up with it everyday and take it with

4936,The kiss of death on a rap pick Then you get a slap quick so guard it with Chapstick In other words protect and hold your own It only takes one punch to get ya head flown Fists of fury suckers get buried Cause the Kane got more spice than curry I am the flavor down on paper And nothin could save ya from catchin the vapors Rhymes thatll sting your face like a quick jab And Im rubbin em in just like Vicks salve Captivatin dominatin innovatin illustratin fascinatin Motivatin elevatin terminatin mutilatin Rhymes theyre worth their weight in Gold bold never sold to a bidder That claim to glitter youre so bitter like kitty litter As for damage dont tell me what another do Cause I quote that Im RAW So make room cause fighters are doomed Try to consume and make your own tomb A grave or a casket a tisket a tasket Youre rhymes out of basket Boy you get your ass kicked For frontin like you hittin hard When your arms are too short to box with God So dont even touch cause I come with too much Address and bless any mic that I clutch And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle he must be senile And thats why meanwhile back at the ranch The brother Asiatic chosen one is expandin with a new branch So many slept on the nonchalant act Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat Make you say daddy I dont want none Kool Moe Dee I seize and freeze MCs with these degrees Put me to my knees or at ease Chiiiillld please I break it down to bring on the next act Rappers are so full of shit they need ExLax So stop griffin your mind is driftin Prepare yourself cause I get swift and Captivate the crowd but you cant understand At times I gotta say to myself God damn As I get hot and still be gettin warmer And I dont have beef with no other performer Keep to myself never bother another But if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker Frontin MCs that be tryin to riff Need to save it and dont even play with Me when I react like a volcano eruptin I step to you and say Now whats up then Every wordll be just like surgery Cuttin you open so rush to emergency Or even bow to your knees and bend low Or get played like a game of Nintendo JOKES aint my style I aint a child thats why I dont smile I combine a line designed to find behind the mind So divine the other rappers need resign As I go on from night to morn Beginning to end from Knowledge to Born Whenever rappers are lookin for static Looks like a job for KingAsiatic NE send me competitors Then again it might just be better to Just slow down you dont wanna throwdown I get busy get you dizzy like a merrygoround Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme And competition prepare for wartime Be alert for where I drop the bomb at As I destroy you with mortal combat I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol Of folders molders towin black gold So let it be said let it be read cause I lead ahead Of others whose rhymes are old as ProKeds Tryin to diss the Big Daddy repertoire Moi You steady screamin out a antique segment wrote As I just play em like a pregnant roach and STOMP EM For tryin the forbidden Your rhymes aint hittin boy you wont be gettin None of or in front of cause every one of My adversaries lack you little son of Obituary columns will read your name If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane So any claimin or aimin to be champion Against me Psssh cant be won I rank supreme and its a rappers dream To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem Cause theres only room for one teacher Wise words from a wise manll reach ya I teach freedom justice and equality Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours Slaves from mental death in power Thats the reason before I drop this bomb I say peace to the Nation of Islam Make you say 6X
