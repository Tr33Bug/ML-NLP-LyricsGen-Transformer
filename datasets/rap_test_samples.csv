All we did was slang dope All we did was slang dope 
Mini Tec thats myâmainâho Grrr 
Fishscale picturesâwish you well
Heard you got 30âup North its aight mean he aint need no scale
Ruger shells at Bloomingdales boomboobooboom 
Word on the street he had two for sale
Pistol in your mouth like a root canal
Aston with the missing roof pissin Vueve Vroom 
Put ten on your head I bet they get you soon
Courtside Zion got thirty Bron got fifty Ah 
I better cook a brick in a jiffy Whip 
All we did was slang dope All we did was slang dope 
Baby TEC thats bae bro Grrr 
Came home scramblin all you heard was ambulance
Somebody got hit on the corner doin hand to hands
1212s out the minivan it had the ceiling fan
Dashboard had the chandelier
Sold grams for years baggin up taste the tears
Hit em up close you gotta face the fears booboobooboo 
Where Im from drivebys overrated Overrated 
If you got five bodies then you famous Then you famous 
Get a hammer for the brick we gotta break it Gotta break it 
Shit broke the blender nigga Brrr

I need your sweet love
Darling cant you see
I need your sweet love
Darling cant you see
Ohoh
Woo I love you
All I wanted 
Boobooboobooboom
In search of right like the birth of Christ
Breakin every generational curse in life
Perverse concise make sure the verse is right
Return who adverse to the Earth
Make sure that my hearse is white
And the contract Jewish to match a grind thats foolish
A Quran thats Buddhist
Rappin so Mike Caren and Denaun stack moolah
As I sign on the dotted line with the passion of a blind tattooist
In reaction to slithers from lizards mouth
Yelawolf this is your first and your last pass
I aint gon put it on blast your punk ass know what this about
You think its bout being loud or tryna be hostile
Til you get found face down on the ground outside of Kid Rock house
Though you a vulture pundit I hope you get sober from this
Men lie women lie so do numbers
The energy never lies when you a overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer
I dont rhyme for the likes Im who the jealous target
Im underground for life this shit is a sellers market
The rich get richer the po get mo greedy
We need Clarance A to get whats owed in these board meetings
Rappers catch Ls after just squeezing em four Feezys
Crackers pattern themselves after the teachings of Morris Levy
But I was dubbed the greatest by the gossip
Im King Tut to haters from this Spyder cockpit
Its Jacob custom makes me fire watches
Inspired by Cool J drivin Saabs
With Cut Creator right beside him drivin Mazdas
I was labeled drugrelated by the coppers
A government that through the republic
Has been subjugated by the mobsters
Martin got shot on the Lorraine balcony became alchemy
Was spit on at the hospital when suffocated by the doctors
Michael was sniped at six at night precisely by a laser
Mac Miller died pleadin for his life reciting Gods prayer
Immaculately conceived the product of Nas labor
Aint shit like me Im Chris Lighty Im Violator
Dedicated to the edification of sellin blackness
I feel like Dame yellin at Kevin Liles over leather jackets
Prince when he told Nas Own your masters or you ass out
Best rapper between Cardi and Meg Thee Stallion is Kash Doll
Overcomer
This Detroit energy Im on forever
Shout out to everybody who made it out Overcomer 
And remember God doesnt call the qualified
He qualifies the called thats Christine Caine
Overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer Overcomer 
The energy never lies when you a overcomer Overcomer 
Oh yeah
The station that keeps you in the groove
SaintTropez
It is that kind of weekend
Keepin it cool laughin with friends family

2095,"Shes something like a porno star
Shes something like a super freak
I never seen her on tape before
But when she go low shes a professional
My kinda girl
Porno star
Shes something like a super freak
Never seen her on tape before
But when she go low shes a professional
Around the Carolina hood see most niggas called her ho and diss her
Cuz shes slowly growing up to be like her older sister
She got a bad reputation so you dont hold and kiss her
And after one conversation youd probly fold in twister
It aint hard to tell that honeys dumb
Shes 18 goin on 21
Mama dont know where she get her money from
Hoppin in the naughty cars
Stuffed in the backseat
Lookin to score big
Cuz she fucks all the athletes
Somethin like a princess gon wrong
Used to be a ballerina
Now she performs to The Thong Song
Happily had plans to enroll in college
Now youd rather slide down metal poles for dollas
Your fingernails and your toes is polished
But your brains on freeze
In other words frozen knowledge
All your plans and your goals demolished
You grew up in Southside
Why niggas know you a ho in Hollis huh
I still remember how it all started
School cuttin from class
Every boy you knew touching yo ass
Headed no where fast
I aint gon lie
Shorty I used to laugh
Cuz you was the main topic on math
I seen her in the mall shoppin
Im contemplating bout stoppin
Cuz she could get me off like Cochran
Now that dinner was poppin
Spoiled her daddy was pumpin
He probly thought shed grow up to get married or somethin
But little did he know
His little princess was a city ho
Pretty ooh the face
Tight from the video
Damn this bitch is thick
She on the Lil Kim shit
See her hair match the color of her lipstick
Now this chick claimed to love jewelry like Slick Rick
And had a walk on her that would leave you with a stiff dick
Jeans had a sick fit
To make a long story short
This aint the type a bitch you wanna stick with

Ice fully glowin plus Im bad to the bone
In the danger zone I hold my own
When the pain is gone like a splinter I enter

I Xd ya amateur damage ya have fools jumpin off
Cliffs grabbin their ass cheeks yellin Geronimo
It aint a problem at all we cant solve
Threehundred sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged by my entourage who put the Ram in Dodge
Ras cla in bumba claat
Maintain few remain in the game
So I remain focused hiphops the main aim
Well its the Funk Doctor Spot the pon cock lyricist
My mentalitys so def yo I aint even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin MCs out by the hundreds
Wanted for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin thinkin
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us
Sprayed a few shank a few rap crews say they shamed too
But cant hang two like we do
Fuck them they better bow slow
This rhymell cold hit em real quick cause Im KSolo

Unload the Glock profusely when sortin out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin Im goin Tony Stewart

Lost my point of view til I find a mirror start talkin to it

The broads elated my boys are faded my cars the latest

Pardon my mental Im higher than Continental
Went from flyin cockroaches to flyin without credentials
Thats private tell the pilot Be quiet we need our privacy
Throw you off this bitch if you wired justifiably
Hustle wit a motive you know this Im wit my whoadies
No snakes no rodents no adlibs no chorus
No stress no worries hook you to a respiratory
Its selfexplanatory the glory is mandatory glory

You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit snot and mucus

3396,"Introduced like hello smooth type mellow
I hide in the room and consume like Jekyll
Take you on a walk in my shoes type narrow
For my nocturnal circle peep the view like window
Moonlight fellow
Of course Im a Jedi with the Air Force Ones
Plus the old school shell toes
One with a number two cruise might test you
Slam when I write see the pen move wrestle
Power in my swing hit the booth like Cecil
Now my team make green like when blue strike yellow
Beats rhyme you could never do like LO
I rock like Everest you dudes like pebbles
Im meek still
Now when you see me in the ville keep it real
You barely making moves like scarecrows
Why bother Dollars make you wanna holla
Costs more than jewels life ghetto
Streets watch deep and my thoughts is deep
Talk is cheap but thatll make you blue like special
The greatest rappers mummies in tombs like pharaohs
I refuse to lose lose lose like echo
Yo you need a whole posse
Some call it cocky only God can stop me
Who else blocking these goals This aint hockey
These haters wanna see me fail go ahead
Watch me Jesse Owens the track
Starter pistol to the finish line record time artist with rap
Beats bang but the truth bang harder than that
When it comes to the music my heart is attached
Now the business is all about dollars and stacks
Those two words together need a abolishing act
Cause sometimes your artist decisions is bad business
And other times thinking dollars is senseless
Back then you could get it for dimes
I had it mapped out God had a different design
Those years Lo didnt get signed
Even though the lyrics was nice Im only getting bigger with time
And I done worth triple the price

Still got my money on my mind
And I feel like Im walking on the line
When it seems like Im running out of time
Thats when Im going on the grind
Ay yo Im trying to make my dollars double
I done found a place to fit in
For niggas trying to get into this power struggle
I work hard on the job like immigrants
And always try to get my first half in advance
It sounds strange but the rap game is not a game
You could make a lot of money gain a lot of fame
But dont get it twisted
You could get addicted
Buy a mansion in the Hamptons and get evicted
Now if you call me and Im not around
Im probably putting my grind down
Doing shows out of town
I be the manager road manager and call handler
Booking agent choreographer and tour planner
I be the VP of marketing and promotions
Producer and arranger with a range of emotions
And after it all I still gotta perform
At three oclock in the morn when half the fans are gone
But its fine
Been on the grind since like 88 or 89
The game is foul like a plate of swine
Now is there anybody kind like me
Is anybody out there on the grind like me
For everybody working nine to five
For everybody trying to rise with they eyes on the prize
Im with cha we all going through it
But yo deep down inside I know we still gon do it
Oh
Im on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I feel like Im walking on the line
And it seems like Im running out of time
Thats why Im always on the grind
Yeah Im on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I feel like Im walking on the line
When it seems like Im running out of time
Thats when Im going on the grind
Yeah
I really feel Im blessed cause I was born with a talent to rhyme
But the stress got me this close to quitting sometimes
On the crowded A train every morning
I cant wait for the day
My hustle game dont got to start this way
Niggas think its all good when they see me and hear my CD
And think Im jumping in the 745 with TVs
They dont know I miss tours and shows
To go to work and pay bills and keep dough on my clothes
In the shadow of a legend so
They expect me to spit and sound like him
But yall need to let it go
Everyday I face the crossroad of rap or drugs
Album cuts and singles and crack heads and clappin thugs
When Im broke my moms wont even give me a hug
But on payday Im her baby then she call it love
I keep making my moves cause one day Im a prove
I got what it take and I will not lose
Yeah
I had to hustle hard never give up scratched to end

465,"The ladies will kick it the rhyme that is wicked
Those that dont know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you break you take you
Now its time to rhyme can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream
Ayo let me take it from here Queen
Excuse me but I think Im about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
Im conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position Ladies first yes Yes 
Yeah theres going to be some changes in here 
Believe me when I say being a woman is great you see
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not for being one but for being with one
Because when its time for loving its the woman that gets some
Strong stepping strutting moving on
Rhyming cutting and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because its Ladies First
I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic look into the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I wont do
Some think that we cant flow cant flow 
Stereotypes they got to go got to go 
Im a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
With what With a little touch of Ladies First
Who said the ladies couldnt make it you must be blind
If you dont believe well here listen to this rhyme
Ladies first theres no time to rehearse
Im divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen
My sister can I get some
Sure Monie Love grab the mic and get dumb
Yo praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in LONDON and sound American
You dig exactly where Im coming from
You want righteous rhyming Imma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother like daughter I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing Im the daughter of a sister
Whos the mother of a brother whos the brother of another
Plus one more all four
Have a job to do we doing it
Respect due to the mother whos the root of it
And next up is me the MONIE LOVE
And Im first cause Im a LADIE
Contact and in fact the style it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track waiting for the climax
When I get there thats when I tax
The next man or the next woman
It doesnt make a difference keep the competition coming
And Ill recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is Ladies First
Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why cause Im that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic I rocked it next
Plex you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift Its Ladies First

2973,"And natures game once more begins
Here we go like yes yes yall
To the beat yall
Aint no sleep yall
To the break of dawn
Five oclock in the morning
We keep rockin on
The workin people runnin like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin in the meat market
Chicks take a seat park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like its heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get er done
That ole hit n run
Turn em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Aint nothin like wakin up with a stranger in your bed nope
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today
Its all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but cant take away the frown
Found under the makeup
I asked her whats your passion
Answered whats the paper
She sleepin and they dont want her to wake up
Maybe then shell realize her own beauty
Baby you a star and not just a star on some dudes home movies
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Steppin out I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
Im slippin in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree now we hang behind the rope we VIP
We do it BIG
Aint no need to see ID
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off dont need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the skys fallin
Like you Chicken Little come on
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn

2441,"I want you
I got to have you
But what will this lead to
Will it just be me and you
Tell me you know I want you
Tell me how you feel
Ill be obliged if you step outside
Because my ride is awaiting our date and
Of steak and a night cap
We mating awaking
By smells of perfume that I inhale
And then tell how well we raise hell on the dizzell
Satin sheets
Heat from your feet keep me warm
The mood is perfected by sounds from the storm
You came stronger I lasted longer
Than Ive ever lasted your mouth was fantastic
The fuck test you passed it
The way you made a nigga laugh I had to getcha
And when I saw that ass pass I had to hit cha
Ya making me fight against my will what must I do
Would ya kill for me ya if my life in danger too
Even steal for me ya if that shit belongs to you
Then feel for me ya if the way you act is true
Who knows fine clothes
Lexus doors youll be closing when you become one of the chosen
Hoes in different places different faces
Different cases got me tied like shoe laces
No mistake this MJG you aint gotta be
Constantly trying to shoot that P claiming that you aint heard of me
Keeping it real let me know how you feel when we communicate
Well be straight if you express your mind
Instead of preferring her weight some who cant do it
Lose women but nigga like me used to it
Space Age Pimping
New day new age
Every once in awhile this is how we slang our game
New day new age
Nothin is too strong
New day new age
When setting it out is all we straight to do
New day new age
Just me and you just me and you
You and I me and you situation getting sticky
Your mouth is saying no but your bodys saying stick me
Lick me dont be afraid of what your friends say
Rappers get dat ass then be outta here like yesterday
But not tonight you look so tight
It feels so right this indo got me perving
Lets go hop in my Suburban
And ride til we get to where you want to be no matter how far
Just call me Oball baby to me youre the superstar
Ask me time and time again why did I choose you
Do I wanna be your man or just misuse you
I hear your partners dissing
When they think I aint listening
Them hoes just be wishing
They could be in yo position
With me in luxury
I got to be everyday
Chiefin hay with something stout wearing lingerie
Lets hit the tel
Get a suite
An order something to eat
Tell me things about you
Ill tell you things about me
Then out the blue Ill be carressing you undressing you
You start doing all shit you said youd never do
Lustin busting all out of my boxer drawers
Fingers dripping slipping in an out in an out
Constantly telling me the things you dont do
Yet you do it like a pro and think I dont know
But I do thats why Im here with you and you know this
Slip on the latex and dive in

817,"Just What Can Happen x 5
Verb and add a metere
Prime time for your mind staff
Lyrically I be the illest monster
Stomp ya
One for the treble
Touching on board Concorde
Stopping the Flight 11
Soaring way beyond ya
Comprhension watch the engine
Toppling and mock the opposition
Not to knock my vision
Slaughtering and not to mention
Hostages and morph inside the fortune off
And while Im scoping
Popping open bottles
Dropping tokenswhere ill get off
And stopping aint an option
Dropping solar cosmic rhymes
And toxic poems Quannum sock ya
Who can rock and
Im a mess
Test a G
I rap and see
Youre back
Youre knowing me
A half a thousand penance back
I leave your Adams apple swelling
Felons laughing like Im Adam Sandler
Smack an average amateur
Towards your slacking savage radical oral path
Im motal rapping
Black immortal tan and tab
And over Spanish black
You know the man is
Cracking open planets graphics ultra maim
And that shows there has been infactual in
Gab and black you know its mass impact
You roll and pass and flinch
I make it happen
Just what can happen x 4
To crush a brain
You never bust in vain
And must you train
Amongst insane
The youngters craving
Aiming for the jugular vein
Complain above your range
I strain to shove you out your lane
Its pain
I came to snub your aim
And duck your lame
And uplift
Ancient culture angles
Tangle up
Your mangled structure
I done just broke your brain
Its over novacaine aint up ta
My Alien Invasion yall
A crazy in erasion all
Occasionally making yall
Amaze ventilate win all
My  is gone
My nature is to take your break your arm
And leg and make it call me
Make it take it come away and hurt ya
ALL NIGHT Crying in your dreams
And Rhyming when I scheme Im silent
Let you beam
And set your screen
Ablaze with FIRE
Its the pride humble markster
Posted like a lion
Sitting in the cut
Know when you sleeping on me
Bout to rudely wake you up
And who be take the cup to profit
And shake you up
Captain rapping
Rock the boat
I shock
You know Im not a soldier kid
I make it happen

Why he had to fuck with me now I gotta kill this man

Dear mammahhhhhhh what have I done
Somebody save me I think I just killed somebody baby
Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin to play me
Couldnt hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin my girl like she was hoein on tour
And knowin Im raw money tried to play fly
I said whassup to the bitch why she couldnt say hi
That aint right I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles
I put em in his face
I didnt have to disgrace myself I hate myself
AHORA A TU BLAH BLAH Brace yourself
Thats the law the streets are like basketball
Sometimes you shoot sometimes you pass it off
Cant always take a shot make one mistake you upstate for what
Too much hate time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I aint tryin to see em
I love a brother doin triple life but I aint tryin to be him
Thats why I be on the low and keep my feet in the row
Cause theyre tellin me as far as felonies
You get life for three in a row
Then whaddayknow Last week at the flicks
I had to kill somebody for steppin on my kicks STUPID 
Mamma I dont understand
Why he had to fuck with me now I gotta kill this man

But hurt one hair on my mamma head and Ima cry like a baby
She my heart and soul what Jimi Hendrix was to rocknroll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible
Now you know one of my weaknesses but Punisher keeps it glizz
So dont pull out cause when I pop oh what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is hold up thats the gas chamber
Think before you put on that skimask and blast a stranger
Relax the anger dont be so hard on yourself
Thats how youll end up twelve years old
Bein charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate
How many hours I waste tryin to figure the shit
Until I finally realized were just niggas and spics
Thats what they feel what can I do but just stay real
Keep somethin in the stash in case I gotta make bail
Cause aint no brothers runnin shit in the system
You goin straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
fuck you talkin about I live here
This is my buildin nigga fuck you nigga
Thats my daughter right there playin fuck off me
Get the fuck off
Mamma I dont understand
Why he had to fuck with me now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma now Im on the run
Dear mammahhhhhhh what have I done
I dont have much time so Im only gonna ask you once
To please forgive me mamma I love you and Im sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
And raise them to be good respectable woman like their mother

And raise my son to be a good man a better man than me

Presenting to you the President of the United States
The bullet being lodged an inch away from his heart Reagan is launched into the operating room and tells his doctors I hope youre all Republicans
Cash rules everything around me
I aint claiming Im street
Im just saying everything that surrounds me is concrete
In the bubbleeyed ride all because I bubble like Don P
Right beside mes a dime piece college girl looking bout as good as I sleep
Thats cause I keep it low the opposite of high key
Yall niggas got the wrong idea bout whats really going on out here
Yall weird I see they told you Keep your ears to the streets
Yall niggas laying down and yall ears out here in these streets
I guess you took it literal
Guess the only code you live bys forgetitcode
Uh if I should get my own guilty verdict
May the next man learn from it then flourish
You could put it on the news you could put my face on the front of a shirt in the latest video then blur it
Yall niggas fucking with the next nigga bitch
Mostly attracted to her cause she the next nigga bitch
One of my niggas made a name for killing niggas
Now he on the slayin spree for Dilla niggas I call it the nigga nitch
Life is set up for you to dig a ditch
God is looking down on all being carried by the crisp pallbearers
Like just ball player
You aint even gotta pull a trigger you can still assist
Imma keep it real as this
Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold em and when to fold em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money aint good money
Got to know when somebody aint good for ya
Got to know when to open and when to close
When being silent exposes and when its golden
Got to know all the got to knows
Got to know all the got to knows
God made us niggas then made us all breakable
Then gave us all decision making thatll make or break a nigga
People tryna blaze with you just so they can lace a nigga
All because of public sensationalism
With brothers with faces that people see and can relate to
When the place where the foundation of eatings
Higher population is based on popularity
Gotta be careful where you place your wisdom
All it takes is just one conversation where you unbeknownst to the fact youre talking to an abomination
At the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong crime taking place
Thatll put you away for a long grind where its locked
Where its not safe unless you know them combinations
Yeah its just a way a man to be taken by the same thing that took his brother
We dont learn from each other we learn to look the other
Way when one of us in trouble
That karma looking to catch you its patient
Itll wait till you think you would love to come get you
Cause it know that women been the downfall of men ever since pussy was discovered
Dearly beloved you soul searching for nothing
Just follow the instincts the lord versed you with historically
That feeling that you get in your gut been getting ignored more than that poor person
Whos living under the gun in this cold cold world that we live in
Thats under the imminent control of the consumer and indigenous war merchants
More religion and more churches doctors more nurses
Cause its the American way to make anything thatll finish you or drop you for purchase
Who said I couldnt buy my way into heaven
All I need is a bottle a couple dollars a couple people thatll keep me company
And who love misery as much as me
You got to know your pedigree got to be yourself at all times
Your true self at all times aint gon hesitate to let you know when you should let it be
A lot of these brothers done died tryna follow their pride
Gotta know the alert signs them butterflies as reliable as your first mind genetically
Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold em and when to fold em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money aint good
Got to know when somebody aint good for ya
Got to know when to open and when to close

We dont honor nothing else except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal eagle leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga dont forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause hes seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world thats enough to respect when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying fuck it at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down

Whatever he dont make its on you
So I be who I be and do what I gotta do
Im one of the few the proud and the pimpest
In this business I be the swiftest when I kick this
As if you didnt know its Thorough from that Suave Camp Ugh 
Best vamp champ or get licked like a mail stamp
Amps and beats techniques is what I come with
Gangsters and pimps and ballers is who I fuck with
Fuck nobodys safe when I see demons in the mirror
Wicked as fuck feeling like a murderin killer
Witness Im on the defense like Johnny Coch
Now give up your things mister before this Glock hit the proper spot
Blocks on phones they wont leave they homes peeping through cracks
Cause blacks be coming back from all that past crap
Strap on your bulletproof vest and combat boots
Its NiggaNigga Day Ugh and this time we gon bomb on you
Babyblue eyes disguise thats wise
Made me lose my ninefive got myself a fourfive Im
Aiming spraying not playing with their vertebraes
These the murder days
So many niggas must come wicked we done heard of ways
I see one two niggas actin live
Three seconds pass fore I blast with my fourfive
Six shots seven cops just to take 8Ball
Nine witnesses reported all the shit they recalled
Everlasting blasting niggas running fast when buckin
Got em ducking putting suckers in the past tense
I be the holder of the gat therefore I shall not run
A psychic couldnt see such a feature for my mamas son
Nigga breathtaker the overweight trouble maker
Fake trick breaker Tennessee earthquaker
Shaking grounds when Im walking smoking fat onion
I get lit then beat the shit out of Paul Bunyan
Fighting Clash of the Titans on your dial
Im gettin blitzed stickin on medusa doggystyle
Word G you heard me the wicked bitch served me
Now Im playing soccer gotta kick her to the curb G
But shes not with it put a spell on the fat mack
I hate smacking hoes but I cant help but to go back
I sound like a fiend every time is the last time
Could this be reality or all in my mind
UgH Spill nines like fluid do it like some Gs
They know me from Colombian streets to Portuguese Nigga how you figure 
I got more scratch than fleas I got more gats than these
Highpowered sour niggas steady slinging crack to fiends
At ease take a look at some black Gs
Scoping the president take over residence like black kings
Stack Gs with phat keys
Rats ease on your properties popping me for my black cheese
I had a cracker on my scope and my finger still itching Bup 
Visions of killing and then the strap start spitting hitting
The prez plottin payback on the devil
A rebel and a mason is what you snakes facing Nigga 
Chasing traders with my data cause a hater should be caught
And peep game when its being taught
Ought to picture this a boss lyricist
Seeing niggas taking shots and them same niggas getting hit
Spit the gift and got fam like Gotti Ugh 
Hitting her like hobbies Hobbies killing everybody Body 
Lift my head grip the bed and I check the time
Its all a dream I seen in my fucking mind
Two hundred eighty pounds of hay
Every damn day I have to test a
Twentyfive lighters on my dresser yessir
Breakfast being served by a ho that look like Jeannie
She grants my every wish and keeps a tightass bikini
Teenytiny as a Barbie Doll summer set
She all up in my house but I still aint hit that pussy yet
I gives props to my butler cause he know
That I know on the downlow hes a chiefin muhfucker for you
Now as I flips through my calendar I spots a winner
Involved with three more freaky hoes wanna have dinner
But I cant do it cause my schedule just too tight
I just phoned Quincy Jonessaid he needs my help tonight
He wanted me to pick the strong from the wimps
Them players with them limps and make a song called We Are the Pimps
I calls Ball Ball calls the crew
We met up at the Penthouse and Paris Round 2
Do you know the code to the fence
If you dont then move on cause you aint got no home in this residence

Take us all through the ghetto my nigga Rick James

When I was a young boy growing up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble or anyone wholl give me some
I was young and crazy In the ghetto 
Didnt know what my life would be In the ghetto 
I was dumb and oh so lazy In the ghetto 
Something had a spell on me In the ghetto 
You all know what Im talking about Talking about ghetto life 
Talking about ghetto life 
You all know what Im singing about Talking about ghetto life

In the ghetto Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto but you cant take it from me
Gotta love it

Thats where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could In the ghetto 
Until your cake stacking shitll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood In the ghetto 
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators til the lobby all smelly In the ghetto 
Thats where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Aint nothing like the hood nigga I dont care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

Where you find beautiful women and rugrats

88,"Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Its been a while we aint talk
We aint seen each other
I guess thats how its supposed to be
Maybe this is fake maybe well never know
I mean we started with love the beginning was magical
Then it ended abrupt hows it us that this happened to
Was it all just a lie How was none of it factual
Even in our demise it seems Im always attached to you
They said If you let it go if its real it comes back to you
She just called me a thief I took it never gave back to you
After all that Ive done figured youd have some gratitude
Look how far we fell off we cant even be casual
Guess we both had times we were being irrational
We both out of our minds how are we not compatible
Say I pushed you out the door and you did what you had to do
Now you play the victim like I wasnt impacted too
Should be a movie star ma you so good at acting new
You like us as strangers me I think its impractical
But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
Guess our bond wasnt as strong as I thought
Well never know come on
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
I mean we started with love then we ended with hatred
The whole world in our business clearly nothing was sacred
I know you down to your core unless for years you just faked it
I know all of your flaws see your soul when you naked
Now you got a new squad all them bitches is basic
And even if they aint it aint hard to mistake it
I think you running from love with me you gotta face it
Are you guarding your heart
From a nigga that always breaks it
Now you live in the club maybe you tryna stay busy
You still call me every birthday to say that you miss me
You check to see who Im with Did anybody come after
But still talk like you the one you say that none of them matter
I guess it is what it is what about what it could be
Do we try this again just to confirm what it should be
But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
I guess our bond wasnt as strong as I thought
Well never know come on
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
Im the one you hide
The one you cant forget
And youre the reason why
I lie awake in bed
You never felt so open
I never been so scared to death
We pushed so hard
Til there was nothing left
Under my skin gave what I had to give
We hit the end
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh

Stay on my job grind with my squad
Hundred racks on my car no license at all
No tint on that thing nigga cause thats how we ball
All these fuck niggas flawed suckas and frauds
My circle so small stick to my script and just ball
First I pick up my bitch then we shut down the mall
Had to pick up the tip she tried to pay for it all
Bring some yac with my plate garlic noodles and steak
Bouncin out the valet with all these tats on my face
People looking like Hey Black nigga stay in your place
But its some shit they gon think and its some shit they gon say
Got to a brick from an eighth see that musics my fate
Switched it up from out my trunk went to the top of my state
And I Versaced my waist like 2Pac in his hey
Bryan Williams how I built this All Money estate woah
I put my right hand to God
I put my right hand to God
Put my right hand to Jesus fly like a eagle
Fight with these demons shine light on my people

My wife is a Cnote but my mistress is Creole
I sip on that Clicquot while Im bangin that ZRo
Ghetto nigga like Cheetos that got more famous than CeeLo
Turn legit from illegal just like Pesci in Casino
Get JS off of Prole watch him blow up like C4
I rose from a Regal Auroras and Lincolns
Lowpros on Alpinas to German drop top twoseaters
Was young and prestigious phone was matchin my beeper
How the fuck you gon reach him He makin more than his teachers
Movin forward with speed all your moralsll leave
Only focus is cheese now the forest is trees
Got infected with greed distort what you see
Your worst nightmare to need is justify your means
Hold up

The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen Look over your shoulder 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Im posed to shine remind Im king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros the cons the diamond rings
Im full with time but Ima bring
The soul divine and cross between
Whats yours and mines the gold the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals Scream 
For hiphop look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks baby you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over its love
I know ya Woo 
Dont you know baby
Dont you know baby
Just look over your shoulders honey
Whenever you need me
Just look Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders honey

Shhh look over your shoulder get me
Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes I see the game is a little different niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit em like darts til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it dont matter how much you gon try to convince me
And you gon make my gun cock and talk a whole nother way yo
Woahohohohoh Woo 
I am the Buddha the Ali Baba the believerer maker
So pristine the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake em
So rude Im so ice cold but Im what you need to just wake em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin for me to just take em
When I arrive my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave even my shadow got a sound to it
Cause Im the god of the harder the martyr the father
I spit a saliva thats leaking a lava
Completin the saga while meetin and greetin
And beating you niggas completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga believe me
Graffiti your armor you heebie you jeebie
Bikini your broad up You guinea pig 
See me now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak have a seat it was deep
I was sleep now the gods up hmm
Upholding the fundamentals while most of you boast a rental
Focus on whats most essential spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder Woo

1457,"Ladies and gentleman my name is Macklemore This is my music and it feels so damn good right about now Check it I got a story yo it goes a little something like
When I was seventeen I was staying in NYC
And my homie told me where I could get a fake ID
Ayo son you better get that shit when you in NY okay 
So I hopped on the subway and I gave it a try
To my pleasant surprise the ID looked fine
59 blues eyes born in nineteenseventynine just right 
Nervous as hell I went to the store with my homie
Came out and yelled Dawg they sold me a 40
Yeah you know that I was the man
Buying liquid contraband with a fake ass hologram
No more looking for bums standing in the rain
Stranded on Broadway and giving em all my change
For the rest of the summer man I was on fades
Seventeen had it made getting drunk everyday
Ayy I got treated a whole new way
Because of a piece of plastic that proved I was of age
You know what Im saying all of a sudden you get this little piece of plastic and youre in the club Seventeen like bah Check it out its like this yo
Now for the next three years I had so much fun
Getting drunk in hiphop clubs where you had to be twentyone
Then one day I was walking and I saw a sign
That said KRSOne twentyone up and live
Thats hella tight
Ayo I heard he always ripped it
So I hopped up in my Civic and went out to buy a ticket
When I got up the the door the bouncer checking IDs
Looks at mine and hes like Nah we dont take these
I tried to reach and grab my shit back
But the mother fucker was tougher than Shaq on crack
I shouldve punched him but I would have reached his knee cap
And that probably wouldnt have hurt him very much
He kept laughing and smilin he called me a dumb shit
And if I wouldve let myself I would have cried in public
Oh no Im like Give it back bro
But no my ID was jacked by the Caucasian Deebo
Ha Im laughing right now but at the time it really was not funny and its still not very funny Fucker
Bitch why you got to take my ID
Why do I have to be 21 to drink a Long Island Iced Tea
I hate bouncers with their bald heads and ten foot tall legs
And shirts that they outgrew when they were like ten
Get em
Your mother is dumb for having you
Youre a bouncer because you have a small dick and as a kid everyone laughed at you
Get em
Youre too big and you never seemed to listen
You look injected with the shit they give to KFC chickens
Get em
I dont like ya at all I despise you
If I was tall I would fight you
If I was a dog I would bite you
Every single day you make people cry
And your job is to go and ruin teenagers lives
Ok Im going too far bouncers arent all bad
Im sure they make great husbands and really strong dads
But hopefully you learned a lesson from me
Never take an MCs fake ID
Yup I said never take an MCs fake ID
You could be buff and tough it dont matter to me
Cause youre going to get burned if you step to MCs

502,"Now everyone complaining how the bar is low
Travel in rabbit hole and see how far it goes
The conveyor of light is shining like an oracle
If you know what the game is missing what you snoring for
If you calling it dead youre adding onto the death
If you aint resurrecting it judgement and resentment hard for those
Grab a pen and pad and show them all how too flow
Could be since you know everything go on and spark the ho
Resurgence of lyricism aint current apparent the yearning the colorful ways of busting
No other could ever enter the zone
Image alone couldnt give you the throne
Man you bugging I thought you was pissed why you sitting at home
Chilling this isnt some cold

It doesnt take a bit of talent to do what they do the game is fully jaded yeah 
Im contradicting the first verse now I tried so hard not to go in notice moment like everything is fabulous
Because it would be hate if I critique and talk about all the whackness that is blatant I can see
These artists arent really nourishing I cant wait until I can eat
They arent garbage theyre like all the bacon I can eat
Im lyin everybodies lying too take a higher fee
And sell out so when you go too hell tell satan bye for me
Go take the lower road I will make it flying free
Ellevate through the heavens by making ryhmes too beats

2698,"I was at the mall sipping on a milkshake
Playing the wall taking a break
Admiring the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and bodys built to swing
Thats when I seen her her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said how you doing my names Big L
Dont ask me how Im living cause yo Im living swell
But then again Im living kind of foul
Cause my girl dont know that Im out on the prowl
To make a long story short I got the digits
Called her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spanking her and thanking her chewin her and doin her
Laughin because my girl didnt know that I was screwin her
Laying like a king on sheets of satin
Thats what time it is you know whats happening
She had a big ole booty I was doing my duty
I mean yo I admit that my girls a cutie
But Tina was exotic Earls my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down I couldnt hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin
Tina got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Tina got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
Tina got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Tina got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
I went to the high school about three oclock
To try to catch a cutie riding my jock
My homeboys jeep the system blasting
Cold forty dogs smiling and laughing
Girls all over the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
Thats when I seen her her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that Id always remember
I said to my man stop the jeep
Shes only seventeen but yo dont sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl yo you look tired
Lets go get some rest relax by the fire
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss I gave her a hug
I said to the girl them young boys aint nothing
You want to get freaky let me kiss your belly button
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eating
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheating but
Brenda got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
Brenda got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time when the waitresses are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parking lot and parked my car
Somebody shouted out I dont care who you are
I paid it no attention I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride
I walked in the place everybody was looking
And shrimp and steak wasnt the only thing cooking
I sat down to eat ordered my food
I said to the waitress I dont mean to be rude
But Ill take you on a platter
She said you got a girl I said it dont matter
You look like youre tastier than a piping hot pizza
Whats your name she said my tag says Lisa
I said OK youre smart and all that
But when you get off work yo Ill be back
She looked at me and said make yourself clear
L where we going I said right here
She looked kind of puzzled I said youll see
I pulled up at ten on the DOT
When she walked out the door I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and placed my order
And gave her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the breaka dawn
All over the restaurant word is bond
I heard somebody coughing I checked my watch
I couldnt believe it said nine oclock
I grabbed my pants put on my Kangol
Who did I see oh yo it was Brenda
Yo she worked at Red Lobster but I didnt remember
Lisa got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt so Im leaving you see ya
Lisa got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt so Im leaving you see ya

2399,"Dont get high off your own supply
Used to be my best homie now I cant even trust ya
Musta got turned out by a busta
Smokin fine reefer wasnt enough so
You graduated now you stuff your nose with that white ho
Niggas beginning to think powdered lips make em hip
Look at the other fiends recognize where you slipped
Cause I remember the times we was smokin bud and drinkin wine
Now all of a sudden out of nowhere you sniffin lines
And Im able to say through all my pains and all my pressures
I kept my nose closed workin to keep my shit together
And why in the fuck you need a sniffin friend
To sniff shit with yo ass cause yo ass got conned in
Think again cause even if Im having problems
Experimenting with other drugs aint gon help me solve em
I tried fry and what in the fuck did it do for me
Not a damn thing now that fry shit is history
Somebodys walkin around dont even know they own name
A couple of years later youll be doing the same thing
I got love for the ones who had love from the jump
But go and tell my brothers fight the funk
Look at ya trying to be like super fly you fucked up
Now your world is a plastic bag of white dust
Sucka busta dont come round me with that
Real niggas use crack to make they pockets fat
We dont need no more zombies walkin dead amongst us
And fake brothas who corrupt the mind of our youngsters
Cocaine one way or another leaves the permanent scars
A life of drug abuse or worse a life behind bars
To some its not a easy choice but it aint hard for me
Fuck that white bitch cause I dont never wanna be
Somewhere trying to make up some kinda lie to say
Why this mothafuckin nose bleed wont go away
You got a fat piece of toilet paper stuck up in your nose pipe
You cant smell shit cause you been snorting through the whole night
I aint tryin to say that Im better than the next man
I understand anyone can do what they know they can
But you cant if you constantly looking for a way out
Stay out my path I aint tryin to put the hand out
I lay out truth in stone so you can get deeper into the shit Im sayin
While my tape is playin need to listen up
Excuses you keep using who you foolin
Nobody but yourself cause that cocaine rulin
Now whos in fuckin charge of your decisions
As long as you continue to fuck around with funk mission
Do you remember back in the day when niggas used to say
Dont get high off your own supply and make that pay
Paper cheese fetti chips grip flo stacks loot green whatever you want to call that shit
Now on the serious tip for real heres what Ive been thinkin
Our world is fucked up and it aint just for one reason
Babys come into this world hooked on drugs with aids
Hypocrites use religion just to get paid
But in my neighborhood I seen somethin hella drastic
It was tragic it left a victim in a casket
Let me take ya back to sometime in the 70s
When old heads used the snow like we smoke weed
That shit was cool then but now lets take another look
Insteada powder packs now you need yo shit cooked
Them cool niggas that used to kick a fro and wear them stacks
He that nigga today starving tryin to buy some crack
Now some people say that all drugs is bad drugs
And in they eyes Im a junkie cause I smoke bud
And so then God please forgive me for I have sinned
And forgive those who lived for the funk

45,"Diamonds The Soul Tape 2 Lyrics
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
I turn my dark secrets into bright ideas
I used to cry for help I learned to wipe my tears
I was scared to embrace but now I fight my fears
These hoes say Im too much its only right I share
Pressure makes diamonds I was made to shine
When life gave me lemons I made lemonade with mines
Whats beef Beef is when you make mistakes
Like less burgers with ya buddies and more steaks for snakes
My story just gets better when you get to the end
So when Im at my worst I know its not the end
I came from the dirt made the cut and blew
So when you put me in that right light
What I do
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Im shining religiously Jesus pieces and crosses
I paid for all of my toys I dont owe any Santa Clauses
I never finished school or completed no college courses
Was taught to be a winner but I learned more from my losses
Losses like when you go is your friends gon miss you
Was it cause you beneficial or you been official
Condo at the top one floor down from Heaven yo
Hating is beneath me I say thats the devil yo
Im tryna keep the faith hanging in with hope
Went to my jeweler brought myself two angels on the ropes
I came from the dirt made the cut and blew
So when you put me in that right light
What I do
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Could say I always was the truth but that be lying a little
You cant spell believe without a lie in the middle
I always say it first niggas trying to ditto
But I got bigger shit to do than to try and belittle
Mind of a general heart of a solider
That just mean I call the shots but aint afraid to take the shots
Niggas gave it all they got still couldnt take my spot
Dont get ya shorty got and have to live out takens plot
I aint give a fuck now I would give whatever
You only live once but legacies live forever
I came from the dirt made the cut and blew
So when you put me in that right light
What I do
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

685,"Its hot like Hell in the south
It feel like we in the devil mouth in the south
So white boys tripping cause we iced out
Cool as a cucumber hopping out
A 73 Impala with the brains blowed out
Let the robbers follow
Swear to God fuck nigga get your brain blowed out
Your baby momma followed or your man shot down
Im from Martin Luther King respect it its holy ground
Whod have thought a nigga out a shotgun house
Would ever drive a car with a angel that bow
Im the shit cause I come from the bowels
The guts of the city aint a nigga fucking with me
Young player from the South tell stories like Biggie
Take the Kings English paint pictures so vivid
That the listener will swear to God they lived it
If that aint God in motion nigga tell me what is it
The church ladies weep when they hear your man speak
They say they see God in me but Im in the streets
They ask me why Im rapping tell me Im called to preach
I smile I kiss em on they honey brown cheeks
I tell em God bless em and they concern for me
But you can never walk on water if you still fear the sea
If Jesus came back Mother where you think hed be
Probably in these streets with me
Peace
Came out the valley of the shadow of death
Judas still got the knife in my back
Devils trying to give a G life for crack
Haters mad cause I baptized my laugh
Keep a Jesus piece to protect myself
If heaven got a ghetto you can bet Ill be there
God is with me
God is in me
God is in me
To get to Heaven I will raise Hell
But before I be a servant in white heaven I will rule in a black hell
See the leader jumping out a black SL
On the block like Yes yeah the truth here
Living reckless for a necklace and big chain
The wages of sin is death not the chain gang
Touch my chain I bang bang bang
Leader of the Grind Time Rap Gang mang
We a squadron of Gods marksmen
Greek heroes we the new Titans
Young Achilles nigga I will kill these niggas
No homo I just dont feel these niggas
Laid back seeing panoramic views
Its a angelic view the sky so blue
Similar to my diamonds and they hue
I pray my success is a torment to you
God MC boy ex dboy
Only thing real in a room full of decoys
Angel wings got a nigga flying higher
I hope my success burn you like hellfire
I hope seeing me whip cars dressed fresh
Torments your ass like a man possessed
Be blessed
Amen

467,"Im sorry for cussing
Fuck you fuck you
Im back Mr Magic City
Blowin color purple I make it rain on your forehead
You woulda thought I had a fan the way I blow that money
You woulda thought I had a plan the way I throw that money
The Feds outside and they checkin his tag
But still the boy move with a hell of a swag
Its like the soundtrack to my life
Everyday Im under investigation
But I will not stop so you can stop the hating
What more can I say Its like my gift and my curse
To fail or succeed I dont know whats worse
I dont know whats worse
Agents tryna find a glitch in my matrix
One slip and Im back to the basics
Red or blue pill what would you do
When the same niggas you love got hate in their blood
I know gods watching over me so is the Feds
When love turns to hate and niggas rather you dead
Lord have mercy Jesus Christ
All the bad Ive done will you still protect my life
Maybe maybe not
Until then I keep an extra clip for that Glock
You wanna see my bank statement
I got no problems with that
Three hundred thousand you know Im smarter than that
I been dodging the alphabet boys all my life
So you gonna need more than a child support lawyer
I got some child support for you
Get off your ass bitch and get you a job
Tell your other three baby daddys to sell dope or rob
My son got everything in the world that I never had
One thing you cant call me is a deadbeat dad
When youre the one that shoulda been exposed
Unfit mother still playin witcha nose
And I dont wanna tell my child
That his moms aint shit
And this aint about him
She just a money hungry bitch
I been here before
They boxed me in a corner and I came out fighting
They locked me in a cell and I came out writing
I said I came out writin
Lock my body you cant trap my mind
I only talk in the bedroom we whisper in the kitchen
Call me paranoid I think the walls is listening
But if them walls could talk
Id prolly never get to see the daylight
I gave it to em raw mixtape after mixtape
I had niggas waiting on the album
I shoulda got five mics in the Source
Instead I got five bricks and a Porsche
They say I aint lyrical
I wasnt tryna impress yall niggas
If hating was a crime theyd arrest ya niggas
Kink bought the mic I just gave him my life
The streets cosigned the hood gave me my stripes
I said the streets cosigned the hood gave me my stripes
Kink bought the mic I just gave him my life
I said the streets cosigned the hood gave me my stripes
Yeah I know you aint done em
Im back better than before matter fact Im better than ever
They cant box me in that boy too clever
So CNN worried bout little ol me
Fuck the bitch ass reporter who wrote the story
You motherfuckers dont know shit about me
What I been through or where I came from
When shit got hard I stayed I aint run
So you can blame the government they made me this way
See the pain in my eyes you dont see me cry
Two tears in a bucket who got that work
Real talk Ill make us a way
Get rich or Imma go to jail tryin
Uncle Sam aint never gave me shit
But my partner out west yeah he front me them bricks
How the hell you expect me to be drug free
When George Bush aint never done shit for me
Follow me home and tap my phone
What happened to my freedom of speech
Love dont love nobody
Got me feelin like I shouldnt love myself
I practice what I preach I preach what I practice
A hundred thou under my mattress
Im only human just a man
God gave me a gift to do the best that I can
Critics say I cant make an album better than my first one
The way I feel thatll prolly be my worst one
Another one after that will be better than my last
So real talk yall can kiss my ass
This is the beginning of the beginning
I am the future
You niggas are a thing of the past
Im not ashamed of who I am or what Ive become
So all you ridicule lookin Im not the one
Its called self respect I bow down to no man
I say all that to say that you cant ban the snowman

2805,"They told me to keep my eyes on the road
And my hands on the wheel I am
But Will I am not
NOT willing to trade spots
But if its Lords will
Come as you will
Let them Devils know I got a force field
And swords to wield
One day it will make sense
Somebody leaving Prints in BelAir
And I aint talkin Will Smith
Im writin this
Like a will with six mills
Whether im making millions
I gotta make six meals
So will I William Shakesphere
YES I will
When youre gone
Will or will not
Theyre stuck with your nick name Bills
Head spinnin like a PinWheel
Or wind mill
If you can make it stop tell me when
Will
The checks come and you got fired or layed off
And you aint even got the rims paid off
Im on the road again like Willie Nelson till the wheels fall off
Elmer Fudd said he will make the heat go off
And you aint Wheely twynna see no loss
Poppin off like a wheely and you will get your ego tossed
I still got it
You used to be fly but you Will Rogers
My heart brave and my Will Wallace
Like Christopher gotta gimme the loot
Got plenty rhymes to shoot John Wilkes in the Booth
Leave ya widow
Weepin like a willow
For many days
I will amaze
say Hey Kids like Willie Mays
Without a ball team
Without a will
Still a way
Heads bob or get slayed sleighed 
I got a dog team

From KC to Williamsburg
Touring the earth
We conquer ya turf
Lo killin the verse
Like William the first
Lets buy a vowel
Wheel of Fortune flippin these words
I stand tall for all I wheel and deal fair
Nobody got yo back you need a wheel chair
With big wheels
I handle bars like a wheel barrel on construction sites carrying big steel
I got a strong foundation so I build towers
They say I couldnt I reinvented the WillPower

481,"There are too many MCs who are overrated
You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
In the rap biz they dont know what rap is
So give it up become a actor or a actress
Or a producer cause you fail to use the
Mic right so take flight fore I bruise ya
For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract
Ayo Im serious Big L aint playin games
I should get foul and buckwild and start sayin names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve
Goin platinum and dont have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold
I dont like the way its goin down
Because it should be the other way around
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
MCs whats goin on
I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
One minute youre hardcore and raw
Thats what you was known for but not no more
You changed you rearranged youre not the same
Your raps are plain that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop now you no longer gain props
Whose fault is that Nobodys but your own black
Used to make phat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
So MCs dont ever step out your range
Remain the same and only change with the time
Or else youll get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like Im goin for mine
But if youre rough stay rough
If youre dap stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
This is how it should be done
Im not the one and my raps are strong like rum
But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb plus slum
How come Rap skills they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail and false like fairy tales
Your technique and everythin you speaks weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
Step to this and get ran over like a train track
Your raps are poor to wack and you went on tour with that crap
Dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares
Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they dont write theirs
But still call themselves MCs
Please how could that be
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
",wack So MCs dont ever step out your range Remain the same and only change with the time Or else youll get dropped like a dime Go for yours like Im goin for mine But if youre rough stay rough If youre dap stay dapper And never try to look or even sound like another rapper Just fulfill your own needs Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it How MCs take this rap game for granted This is how it should be done Im not the one and my raps are strong like rum But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb plus slum How come Rap skills they have none And I wonder how the hell they records sell They raps are stale and frail and false like fairy tales Your technique and everythin you speaks weak You got a little airplay because of your beats Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black Step to this and get ran over like a train track Your raps are poor to wack and you went on tour with that crap Dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack I got more soul than Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they dont write theirs But still call themselves MCs Please how could that be I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it How MCs take this rap game for granted,There are too many MCs who are overrated You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it In the rap biz they dont know what rap is So give it up become a actor or a actress Or a producer cause you fail to use the Mic right so take flight fore I bruise ya For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract Ayo Im serious Big L aint playin games I should get foul and buckwild and start sayin names But deep down inside you know who you are Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar And that really gets on my nerve When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve Goin platinum and dont have no soul Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold I dont like the way its goin down Because it should be the other way around I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it I dont understand it How MCs take this rap game for granted MCs whats goin on I dont understand man how rappers cold transform One minute youre hardcore and raw Thats what you was known for but not no more You changed you rearranged youre not the same Your raps are plain that explain why you lost your fame Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops You turned pop now you no longer gain props Whose fault is that Nobodys but your own black Used to make phat tracks jack but now youre stone

RIP Dex Osama Lil Snupe
All the fallen soldiers
Scooter Truce
When they killed my nigga Snupe I seen my young nigga
In the casket he aint even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Aint got no patience for these motherfuckin fuck niggas
I watch everybody change they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin Uies its gon cost em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin Truce 
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So Ima hold it down til we all win
Weve been at the Clearport ballin
I just want to see my niggas flossin
Hundred bands everytime I walk in
If you keep it trill youll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama she cant sleep I come here early mornings mama 
But mama I got thirty in this dirty 40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
Cause this the type of moneyll get your lined up
And I cant trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but aint nobody roll bout it
Three felonies aint graduate no I am not your role model
I hope the Lord got us
When they killed my nigga I seen the footage on the tape
Man I mustve threw up everything I ever ate
Man I know he got some dice at the Heaven gates
Kicking shit with all these bitches like hes Kevin Gates
Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and Im built Ford Tough
And Im going through stuff
I dont feel no love
I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking Perkys man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come Im gone
I wan see my brother with the Patek not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused I done noticed all the damages
I dont see no purpose in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas I went crazy I couldnt balance it
You cant question God yeah yeah and then theres challenges
Sipping on this Actavis I swear I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip accurate
And Im leaning like a project banister
Im a boss I aint never need a manager
Got rich with thugs scandalous ayy
Fuck it we ball yeah
All the soldiers we lost yeah
Fuck it we balloohall
For all the soldiers we lost
Shawty on percocets in the bag
All the soldiers we lost 
Got a Rollie and a Pateky in my bag

661,"Now I cant pledge allegiance to your flag
Cause I cant find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast these streets are demons abs
Im telling you that setup in them situps is so sad
The system is a slab corruption is the swinger
Sitting high riding dirty drag racing into danger
And its so clean pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I cant shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down in tatters on the floor
I shed tears I dont know what really matters anymore
Cause I dont know what really matters anymore
Man it aint mean
The strangest thing youve ever seen
Oh would you look at how they swing
Would you look at how they swing
They aint dead though
No I didnt die yall
I cut myself down
And I admire my fall into grace
Now as I wander through the city going mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience full of swag
Man they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doing bad
Then the separation from the truth is getting vast fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Doubleedged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Doubleheaded voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummying down of the importance of crowns well never have
Thats why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be living off your sad
Hating on your happiness you hit em off with laughs
Smile til they surrender then you kill em off with glad
Hello EvilIm back
Man it aint mean

Oh would you look at how they swing
Would you look at how they swing

2563,"Hypocrites hookers sex offenders
Yall niggas wanna be pimps and players
This aint 1997 nigga
Id rather be rich and unhappy than broke and miserable
Cause the game dont give a FUCK if you lyrical
And thats pitiful so my position is pivotal
You can hate me all you like but you worship the principle
I inspire revolution the governments not invincible
Vietnam to Venezuela trick knowledge they pimpin you
All up in the hood like McDonalds and liquor
Selling AIDS medicine when we know you got the cure nigga woo 
You leery of conspiracy theory but hear me
From a business perspective it makes more sense clearly
Cause moreover thats what we go to war over
And numbers dont lie unless we do Bush and Gore over
Free markets make money disingenuously
But I invest in agriculture biochemistry
Smart nigga from the hood pussy what type of crime is that
But execs are like You from Harlem Where your diamonds at
Stupid
Cant dodge the game
If you lookin for the money or the fame ohohh 
The players and the rules aint changed oh no 
But see we tryin to leave a name
So were turnin out
Yeah this is how pimps get pimped and players get played
Rich people get robbed and broke niggas paid
New York London Chicago Philly and LA
Miami DC Bmore and out in the Bay
Were tearin it out of the frame
See we deserve to stake that claim
If we didnt its a cryin shame
What were concerned about is how to turn it out
Show me a pretty girl with the world stuck to her
And I bet you theres a brother thats tired of fuckin her
Lots of niggas girls is someone elses one night stand
I probably made some bitches nervous listenin with they man ha ha 
And if that offends somebody Im sorry fuck you
What you think revolutionaries dont like to fuck too
You just gotta beware of dangerous coochie
Cover ya head like a kufi some rappers think that they live in a movie
Until they get herpes or clap from a groupie
And I dont need to shout you out nigga you know who you be
Look most people are only players cause they got played
And have not let go of that shit since the 7th grade
Yeah you got your heart broke life sucks doesnt it
But you shouldnt fuck up someone elses life because of it
Someone did your mother like that thats why you fatherless
Before jail or racist cops thats what the problem is
See whos the one to place that blame
We getting trapped in cycle of pain
With a generation headed down the drain
Thats how were turning out
This is how pimps get pimped
And players get played
Beautiful women get cheated on
And gangsters strayed
Jersey Detroit Denver Phoenix Atlanta
Texas Vegas Seattle and fuckin Louisiana
Regardless of the money youre paid
You spend it on a watch and a chain
But cant offer your children a thing
What the hell is goin on in your brain
Yeah Im not a crack rapper Im not a backpacker ha ha ha 
Im not a wack rapper moonlighting as a bad actor
I treat labels like the projects cause Im a hater what 
Go to the Sony building and piss in the elevator
Cater to hustlers crooks and cheap smugglers
Bootleg my own album to reach customers yeah 
Every city state and country the hood love me
Even Aborigines in Australia bump me
They say underground fans are all the color of talcum
But who the fuck you think buy 50 and Jay albums
Who the fuck you think made Snoop and Dre platinum
Call up any major record label and ask em
But theres some devils in disguise in hiphop
That belong at Republican fundraisers with Kid Rock bitch 
I hope one of my fans has one of your kids shot bitch 
And blames it on Acid Prozac and Slipknot
You a pussy actin hard like a bitch cop
Ill drop you to the floor like a reverse wristlock
Eat your food and shit on you like a highway pit stop
And make revolutionaries out of kids that used to flip rocks
The government pimped 911 to go to Iraq
And history repeats itself right on track how 
First as a tragedy and then the comedy begins why 
Cause its funny motherfuckers dont see it come around again
Where can we be free FUCK we gon be free man 
We only wanna live our lives
Live our lives with our eyes open

Boston baked beans and candy canes
Exchange a look on the number two train
Run catch kiss sunshine or rain
Jackson 5 Good Times The Jeffersons
Yeah Baby you know I liked it better when
You lived closer but then you moved
But that couldnt stop our groove
My magicman my Brooklynboy wonder
I rub your shoulders if pressure you was under
Late night rides out to Sunrise
Catch a flick or two and then back to BedStuy
You in the bubble goose me in the sheep skin
Cold as hell back then it wasnt mattering
Long as we were hand in hand your my man Im your girl
Ready to conquer the world
Chorus Gina Thompson 
This is for all the years youve been
My companion as well as my best friend
So tonight Baby Im giving you what you want
Its all yours
Our love is like a Romeo and Juliet flick
So surreal but yet picturesque
There were problems I can admit
But we handled it and still the candles lit
So glad that we didnt just jet
Cause now we reaping the benefits
Who would have thought
The cute little boy from down the street
Would fall in love with me
Its like a number one dream come true
To have somebody you love love you
And thats all that matters
Is that we grow together make sure we never shatter
Youre the reason I live
Because I want you to get all that I got to give
Long as were hand in hand youre my man Im your girl
Ready to conquer the world
Chorus
Our love is mystical like galaxies you cant touch
Around the world and back again I love you that much
Our love is destiny like Bonnie and Clyde
Well die of old age side by side
Throughout the days I remain truthful
I keep it tight for you sexy and youthful
I told my mom when our days are through
If you have to go first bury me next to you
What I feel is unexplainable I love you
Just aint enough to say to you
Youve been there from the beginning to the end
My companion as well as my best friend
You got my heart now heres my life
Yes Im ready to be your wife
From here one know that youre the one
Everything you want its done
Chorus
",the street Would fall in love with me Its like a number one dream come true To have somebody you love love you And thats all that matters Is that we grow together make sure we never shatter Youre the reason I live Because I want you to get all that I got to give Long as were hand in hand youre my man Im your girl Ready to conquer the world Chorus Our love is mystical like galaxies you cant touch Around the world and back again I love you that much Our love is destiny like Bonnie and Clyde Well die of old age side by side Throughout the days I remain truthful I keep it tight for you sexy and youthful I told my mom when our days are through If you have to go first bury me next to you What I feel is unexplainable I love you Just aint enough to say to you Youve been there from the beginning to the end My companion as well as my best friend You got my heart now heres my life Yes Im ready to be your wife From here one know that youre the one Everything you want its done Chorus,Our love is oldschool like Mary Janes Boston baked beans and candy canes Exchange a look on the number two train Run catch kiss sunshine or rain Jackson 5 Good Times The Jeffersons Yeah Baby you know I liked it better when You lived closer but then you moved But that couldnt stop our groove My magicman my Brooklynboy wonder I rub your shoulders if pressure you was under Late night rides out to Sunrise Catch a flick or two and then back to BedStuy You in the bubble goose me in the sheep skin Cold as hell back then it wasnt mattering Long as we were hand in hand your my man Im your girl Ready to conquer the world Chorus Gina Thompson This is for all the years youve been My companion as well as my best friend So tonight Baby Im giving you what you want Its all yours Our love is like a Romeo and Juliet flick So surreal but yet picturesque There were problems I can admit But we handled it and still the candles lit So glad that we didnt just jet Cause now we reaping the benefits Who would have thought The cute little boy from down

2996,"Brainiac dumbdumbs bust the scientifical
Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can you find ya way through the lyrics that be catching em
Throw another rhyme across the room they be fetching em
And they take a loss take a loss to the Master and I
Throws crazy blows and they knows I be plastering
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk little suckers didnt know I had the gall to
Come around they block with my cockdiesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to diss them and
They didnt wanna battle if they did when they saw me
Theyd a opened up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers I know you hear me callin you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin aint no future in your frontin so lets get it on
Like Marvin Gaye hey take the cash and sit it on
The hood of ya wickwack lowridin Cadillac
Back up ya boys and lets start the battle
Act like ya know the Masta Ace dont play when it come to my bass aahhhh
Check it out baby check it out yall
I was born to roll repeat several 
Drivin down the block like what else should a brother do
Its Saturday its Saturday the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows yeah I have a airconditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to
Waitin at a red light Kentucky Fried Chicken in
Low End Theory tape in bass crazy kicking in
See this Puerto Rican Latin Chico Rico Suave
In a red Corolla eh yo does he wanna play
Pullin up beside me looking like he want it
Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we cant hear they horns
Cause he got musica grande yeah he got it goin on
But I think I better school him cause he dont know the time
So Im turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hitting from like 50 blocks away I
Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play
High decibels passing through a residential district
See a few cuties and I turn it up like Bisquick
Mira mira man dont sleep I got tha I got tha I got the woofers in my Jeep
Check it out baby check it out yall
I was born to roll repeat several 
Black boy black boy turn that shit down
You know that America dont wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to Africa
Nigga Ill arrest you if you holding up traffic
Ill be damned if I listen so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
Im breaking ear drums while Im breaking the law
Im disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can if you can heres a donut
Cause once you drive away yo ya know Im gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya cant stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it they probably start dancing
Jumpin on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis
Strictly the hardcore dirty street level hits
Gods on my side so watch what the devil gets
Positivity hitting 50 levels deep
Coming out they coming out the woofers in my Jeep
Check it out baby check it out yall
I was born to roll repeat several

Blow for blow I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom

1811,"Yes I did I made a mistake yes I did 
Huhya know living this type a life
Makes you grow up faster than youd expect to sometimes
Fuck around and be in your late twenties
Feelin like a old man and shit
Yeah for real son let em know
Its hard to breath and hard to run when your lungs blackened
Coughing up blood like what the fuck happened
Raising my risk of cancers the answer homie
But after drinking something theres nothing like puffing a bogie
Now I can blame the same product placement in movies
Or the commercials or Scarface in a jacuzzi
But now Im living it
Damn I should a never took that first cigarette
I made a mistake 
I fucked up like your girl was riding on top of me
I should of took her to trial and never copped a plea
But this aint a Christian nation motherfucka please
America never taught me to turn the other cheek
Cause Im from Harlem the north of Manhattan
We knock niggas out and make em bounce like Ricky Hatton
But wildin on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border
I made a mistake 
I knew she was a virgin when I first met her
Rockin stockings and poppin out of the catholic school sweater
Mom told her she could do better than a criminal
Seventeen yearold psychotic trying to be lyrical
I never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life
But I was careless instead of treating her right
I seen her again at some club strippin and wondered
If I could have made her life different
I made a mistake yes I did 
Tech talking over the beat
Damn shortie you got me on some singin the blues shit
But you gotta stop looking backwards and remember to look ahead
This is for all my dudes on patrol in the desert right now for real
I made a mistake 
Yeahyeah I joined the army looking for money to go to college
But they aint pay me a quarter of what they fucking promised
Extended my tour treating me like a sucker
Thats the reason officers get fragged motherfucker
Dont give me speeches on how you respect and you love me
But no body armor in a lightly armored humvee
My familys lonely and you want me to reenlist for 30 grand homie
I made a mistake 
When I was young I got signed to a record label
The deal looked so good when it was on the table
It paid for my cable cribs cars and jewelry
The studios the women theres nothing they wouldnt do for me
Except stop screwing me for publishing and royalties
How the fuck are you my dawg when theres no loyalty
Word to the street
I shouldve gone independent like Immortal Technique
I made a mistake 
Some people learn from mistakes and dont repeat them
Others try to block the memories and just delete them
But I keep em as a reminder they not killing me
And I thank God for teaching me humility
Son remember when you fight to be free
To see things how they are and not how you like em to be
Cause even when the world is falling on top of me
Pessimism is an emotion not a philosophy
Knowing whats wrong doesnt imply that you right
And its another when you suffer to apply it in life
But Im no rookie
And Im never gonna make the same mistake twice pussy

Cut a few corners chunk a few dubs
Get em jump back trill niggas show love
Some try to hate I dont pay it no mind

Ebb and flow
Stop look listen learn
Play with fire and youll get burned
You think you want some but you dont want none
A fight on the mic you dont want one
I turn the heat on proceed to beat on
Any soft sap who think hes gone
Na come in my realm when Im at the helm
Nightmares a joke when Im on

This is a flurry a fist of fury
A rhyme so fast that it has to blurry
Your vision dont wink blink or stop to think
Or you might miss the next rhyme
Ink flows from the brain to the pen
And comes alive when the thought transcends
From the pen to the paper and paper to tape and
A tape to the wax and back to the tape
Another hit which you cant get with
A brainiacll react but a nitwit
Cant relate he cant hold the weight
The rhymes too deep and he sleeps awake
The comatose need a double dose
Cause Kool Moe Dee dont rhyme like most
Simplified rhymes or out of the norm
But I simplify if Im to perform
Records for the poprock playlists
The pop jocks dont play this
In an intent to hold rap back
They stop the hard hard and play the wack wack 
They play the weak cause the weak wont speak
But that just makes a fan go seek
A station that they know will bust this

You connect it
Those who chose to oppose are foes
And usually cant grow afros
As the rhyme flows the spirit grows
But only those with a pure soul knows
The relevance of the beat of the drum
And where its coming from
For those of you who just dont listen
Heres the second boat youre missin
Just like Noah had you swimming
Raps a warning of an ending
Of an era a reign of terror
Over like a nova never ever
Try to amplify the lie
The truth wont die and thats why I
A versatile child of the Nile
Speak with a ghetto style and meanwhile
The reason I relate to the youth
Is pure souls can feel the truth
The poisoned souls have tried to stop it
But just stop it cause hiphop is
From our roots and you cant touch this

3109,"A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I see through walls thats hard to climb
Im losing my mind
No medicaid no medication
Thinking youre better off dead
Instead should have been dedicated to education
I spin the cylinder on my revolver
I spin the cylinder
Would someone explain whod leave a dick in charge of a bush
Of a colon Im screwed saw more war than Warsaw Poland viewed
An infants insides outside of his body
Inside of a place of worship ungodly
Out cries tears Dear God where are we
Thats what I scream towards the skyline but probably
No one can hear a word of what I was saying
Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying
Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by
Lights flash if i could only put the past on a flashdrive Id
For peace of mind install an external drive
So Id be more driven internally to survive
Im
A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
So I spin the cylinder on my revolver
I spin the cylinder on my revolver 
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
So I spin the cylinder on my revolver
I spin the cylinder on my revolver 
My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health
It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth
Void I defected employed self annoyed
Went independent enjoyed stealth
Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac
The rents cheaper in the ghetto but you cant go back
So I spin the cylinder on my revolver
Then maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra
And dissolve into the abyss without evolving
Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver
Research like George Washington Carver
But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then
Part instead of being incredibly defiant
Peddle through revenue issues Ill do it for medical science
Its better to be levelheaded than to regret it and pious
Settling for life without sunshine never vibrant Im
A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I can see through walls its hard to climb
Im losing my Im losing my mind

2109,"FAY Lyrics
Im startin to think that my skill is a waste
Still in the race with an ice grill on my face
Mad at the world mad at you mad at my girl
Mad at my friends and anybody drivin a Benz
I really hate this nigga that delivers my mail
But if I hit him they gonna send me up the river to jail
I hate my neighbors they always askin for late night favors
Hate indie labels especially hate majors
I dont give a fuck no more fuck this tour
Fuck these shows and these groupies they all hos
Hate these rude people stayin all in my face
And hate the fact that Visa always callin my place
So all you mean creditors and magazine editors
Same ones that debted us and put niggas ahead of us
Im a mad dog who sits in the dark
Im fixin the bark watchin 106 And Park
What a mess I guess Im sorta stressed
Turn on the radio and I get more depressed
No wonder Im kinda bitter
Strick told me I should quit player hating but fuck that Im not a quitter
Had a few cats betray me try to play me
Bail and try to blame me fuck you pay me
If yall could yall would finish me
Thats why this finger here is for everybody in the industry
When you tryin to hustle for pay and people get in your way
Thats when you ready to say Fuck all yall
When the job is givin ya hell and pay is minimum scale
Thats when you ready to yell Fuck all yall
When its really starting to seem that people killing your dream
Thats when you ready to scream Fuck all yall
Im talkin to you and Im talking to you and Im talking to you nigga
Yo Im simply trying to eat til my belly is fat
And I rest in the Midwest where R Kelly and Nelly be at
Where my name ring bells like Whos celly is that
And Yo Strick you about to blow yo stop telling me that
Cuz at the end of the day Im still just a nobody
Cuz nobody knows me no record label chose me
But Tommy Boy did and look where that got me
A bad attitude and a reason not to be cocky
A huge debt three lawyers and two managers
A bullshit advance that didnt recoup the damages
A couple of singles that wasnt really chartin
Yo Ace I got a Cherokee Bow Wow got an Aston Martin
That motherfucker got a mansion with a swimming pool
A rec room with many games and plenty women too
He prolly got his own chef and a fuckin hot tub
I got a truck with four rims but yo they not dubs
Speakin of nots yo Im not a happy camper
Not gettin no younger feeling like a grandpa
Yo I got low self esteem
Just like a nigga running in place tryin to chase his own selfish dream
And fuck my girl soon Ill be startin to creep
Shes a slob and dont care if her carpet is neat
She got a slick mouth and always gets smart when she speak
And cant cook a lick and the bitch fart in her sleep
I got a dog that dont bark and cat that dont meow
Everybody else is rich and I dont fuckin see how
Sometimes I wonder why even bother waking up
Should just end it and give back the spot Im takin up
",and Im talking to you and Im talking to you nigga Yo Im simply trying to eat til my belly is fat And I rest in the Midwest where R Kelly and Nelly be at Where my name ring bells like Whos celly is that And Yo Strick you about to blow yo stop telling me that Cuz at the end of the day Im still just a nobody Cuz nobody knows me no record label chose me But Tommy Boy did and look where that got me A bad attitude and a reason not to be cocky A huge debt three lawyers and two managers A bullshit advance that didnt recoup the damages A couple of singles that wasnt really chartin Yo Ace I got a Cherokee Bow Wow got an Aston Martin That motherfucker got a mansion with a swimming pool A rec room with many games and plenty women too He prolly got his own chef and a fuckin hot tub I got a truck with four rims but yo they not dubs Speakin of nots yo Im not a happy camper Not gettin no younger feeling like a grandpa Yo I got low self esteem Just like a nigga running in place tryin to chase his own selfish dream And fuck my girl soon Ill be startin to creep Shes a slob and dont care if her carpet is neat She got a slick mouth and always gets smart when she speak And cant cook a lick and the bitch fart in her sleep I got a dog that dont bark and cat that dont meow Everybody else is rich and I dont fuckin see how Sometimes I wonder why even bother waking up Should just end it and give back the spot Im takin up,FAY Lyrics Im startin to think that my skill is a waste Still in the race with an ice grill on my face Mad at the world mad at you mad at my girl Mad at my friends and anybody drivin a Benz I really hate this nigga that delivers my mail But if I hit him they gonna send me up the river to jail I hate my neighbors they always askin for late night favors Hate indie labels especially hate majors I dont give a fuck no more fuck this tour Fuck these shows and these groupies they all hos Hate these rude people stayin all in my face And hate the fact that Visa always callin my place So all you mean creditors and magazine editors Same ones that debted us and put niggas ahead of us Im a mad dog who sits in the dark Im fixin the bark watchin 106 And Park What a mess I guess Im sorta stressed Turn on the radio and I get more depressed No wonder Im kinda bitter Strick told me I should quit player hating but fuck that Im not a quitter Had a few cats betray me try to play me Bail and try to blame me fuck you pay me If yall could yall would finish me Thats why this finger here is for everybody in the industry When you tryin to hustle for pay and people get in your way Thats when you ready to say Fuck all yall When the job is givin ya hell and pay is minimum scale Thats when you ready to yell Fuck all yall When its really starting to seem that people killing your dream Thats when you ready to scream Fuck all yall Im talkin to you
1979,"Lovely lady girl you drive me crazy
I know this girl with her own crib in isolation
Shes from Puerto Rico halfblack on vacation
Fine freak with thongs on whup me every week
Panties in service the big twos make her nervous
Hey Boo heres lollipops Imma give em too you
Bang you nice backdoors Imma scrape the floors
Look at your personal silk on the camcorder
Then hit bedsprings my thumbs on the tape recorder
With big cups of Cristal Imma spank her well
If I lick you there my girlfriend Imma tell
Rock your boots and leave my style written on your cooch
With rubber demands condoms in your soft hands

She got her hair done apartment two the girl is mines
Trippin down the pants shes wearin spandex
And flower dresses the booty to the max apex

Stroke to get live you melt down when I tap the sack

Rubbin you down in baths Calgon bound

Emotional status Im puttin tongues to the baddest

Infedelis her friends are mad gettin jealous
Blockin my great view some knuckleheads down too

1,"Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want to nigga but I will if I got to
Kill if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around
Yeah respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa the toasters right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal an infantry Im built for this mentally
Thats why Im the general I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga Ill be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friendsll do
I drop a bag off then let a mag off
The Heckler and Kochll tear half of your ass off
Im not for the games Im not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twentyone shots off at the same time yeah
Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want to nigga but I will if I got to
Kill if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around
Yeah where Im from death is always in the air homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creeping through the hood wearing Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know if not they better check my background
Try and stick me Ill fill your back with MAC rounds
Ask Preme nigga 50 dont back down
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line boy Ima air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what thats bout
Nigga I know you aint mad I done came up
And if you are fuck you cause I aint change up
The OGs wanna talk but I dont know these niggas
And I aint did no business with em I dont owe these niggas
A minute of my time I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the worlds mine yeh
Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want to nigga but I will if I got to
Kill if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen a MAC aiming at your head man
Before you know it life is flashing reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead mane
I done been there I done copped that
It aint never been a question Im bout that
Dont go there you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and reroute that
Youll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggas
50 dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so
Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies

Clean out your ears and open your eyes
We gonna rock with the bass roll with the highs
Gonna say a funky rhyme and make you all come alive
Hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hiphop and you dont stop the rock
First you rock the hip and then you rock the hop
Then you hippie the hop and dont stop
Going on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what the popcorn
Gonna rock the beat to the break of dawn
Gonna party party party til youre all going home
This is the way we used to rhyme
These are the rhymes that we used to say
This is the way we used to sound
Way way back in the day
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
Cause I am the man with the master plan
Going back and forth and forth and back
Three words for the wack stay the hell back
If the wack may attack keep the wack back
This drum machine is guaranteed to cause a heart attack
Going up to the ceiling down to the floor
Bounce around the balls and back out the door
Tried to come back in cause you want more
Those funky rhymes galore
Pepper to the salt salt to the pepper
Dont come to the party if youre a halfstepper
Salt to the pepper pepper to the salt
If you cant rock to this it aint my fault
A lime to a lemon a lemon to a lime
I rock the rhyme in half the time
From a lemon to a lime a lime to a lemon

The Clark Gable on the turntable

Im giving you a taste of the disco slice
Like 456 on Ceelo Dice
And I get more sex than a cat chase mice
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Lets rock to the rhythm of the rock rock rock
And roll and rhyme and rock and roll
Come on party people lets get out of control
Now the people in the back and not the wack
To the people on the side lets ride
To the people in the middle let me see you wiggle
And people on the top dont stop
Jump up jump up
Just like a disco duck
Go down go down
Just like a disco clown
Go on go on
To to the break of dawn
Jump back jump back
And I can rock it like this cause I got it like that
Now do it do it do do do it

2773,"A lot of people black white Mexican
Young or old fat or skinny
Have a problem being true to theyself
They have a problem looking into the mirror
And looking directly into their own soul
Thats the reason I am who I am today
Cause I can look directly in my face and find my soul
Im old enough to know better young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die than live and duck
If youre cool being taken down and giving up
Your lifestyles a blow job the way youre living sucks
I done felt pain waited but no help came
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain
Ever been told go to hell and felt flames
The waters to your neck and only gets deeper
Its all down hill and it only gets steeper
Gotta get over it be a hurdle leaper
It cost to be the boss and it aint get no cheaper
But theres a man above that we all under bro
No bread truck but he work wonders though
After you wake up everything is wonderful
You can overcome anything you undergo
As an artist Im just tryna paint the perfect picture
But see where tryna wait for somebody thats perfect gets you
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses
And I be tryna cut surgeon bitches
Dreams of splurging riches pretty but curvy missus
Chef to serve the dishes driver to swerve the ditches
Im just another kid on the curb with wishes
And the streets is tough on the verge of viscious
So I sold weed and crack merged the business
That white girl helped a nigga Fergalicious
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses
So when you killing shit watch out for the murder witness
An old head told me let nothing disturb your business
Beef is only good when you in the burger business
So I chilled but loaded up the steel
Like I wish a nigga would but I know a nigga will
But for real you loaded up to kill
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will
And I dont owe these niggas nothing
Put that in a nigga will
",you wake up everything is wonderful You can overcome anything you undergo As an artist Im just tryna paint the perfect picture But see where tryna wait for somebody thats perfect gets you That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses And I be tryna cut surgeon bitches Dreams of splurging riches pretty but curvy missus Chef to serve the dishes driver to swerve the ditches Im just another kid on the curb with wishes And the streets is tough on the verge of viscious So I sold weed and crack merged the business That white girl helped a nigga Fergalicious But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses So when you killing shit watch out for the murder witness An old head told me let nothing disturb your business Beef is only good when you in the burger business So I chilled but loaded up the steel Like I wish a nigga would but I know a nigga will But for real you loaded up to kill Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will And I dont owe these niggas nothing Put that in a nigga will,A lot of people black white Mexican Young or old fat or skinny Have a problem being true to theyself They have a problem looking into the mirror And looking directly into their own soul Thats the reason I am who I am today Cause I can look directly in my face and find my soul Im old enough to know better young enough to not give a fuck Rather hold my head high and die than live and duck If youre cool being taken down and giving up Your lifestyles a blow job the way youre living sucks I done felt pain waited but no help came Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain Ever been told go to hell and felt flames The waters to your neck and only gets deeper Its all down hill and it only gets steeper Gotta get over it be a hurdle leaper It cost to be the boss and it aint get no cheaper But theres a man above that we all under bro No bread truck but he work wonders though After
562,"Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping

Oh thatll work be funky you know what Im sayin
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by
Cars ride by with the boomin systems Funky 
Cars ride by For all the cars out there and all the brothers 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems That like to front in they rides 
Cars ride by Check it out 
You know its funky funky funky cause you heard it from here see
A jam that you love that dont be gettin no airplay
Strictly for frontin when youre ridin around
Twelve oclock at night with your windows down
Headlights blinkin cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hiphop spots
Push the EQ and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side people everywhere
The trunk full of amps there aint no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cause they dont understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
Its because I want attention when Im ridin by
And the girls be on my jock cause my systems fly
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by with the boomin systems All up at dawn 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems Just frontin 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cause they be hear me gettin funky frequently
They tell me dont drink and drive I say What is this
Mind your business
Then pass it around
Laid back hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While Im checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
Im frontin and I dont care if you know
The back seat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise its three oclock
The girlies they smile they see me comin
Im steady hummin I got the Funky Drummer drummin
My trunk be shakin vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud all the shorties be babblin
My righthand mans here without the swing
Every chance I get Im showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cause Im frontin in my ride and my word is bond
Cars ride by with the boomin systems Frontin you know what I mean 
Cars ride by
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by
Sunroof open so I can feel the wind blow
I dont give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means Im chillin
Like Spoonie Gee said my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say I want bass
I want a hit I want a dose
Youre rollin up smilin but you cant come close
Cause my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane fight the power with PE
Tell the cops You gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin thatll break your trunk
And remember Uncle L is like the future of the funk
Cars ride by with the boomin systems Yeah thats frontin

Cars ride by So next time youre in your ride pumpin it up

1513,"Look somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow silk sheets and a satin pillow
This California king loved you like a sack of indo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos
Master suite frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like a blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
Know wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just dont look down at your feet
Look
Told this world I was a star Im gon need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
We used to be respected now they laughin
Weve turned into possessions with no passion
How we go from the best to less than average
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
With no collective identity 
You You You You
Its every man for himself 
Me Me Me Me
We need a black mafia 
Us We We
Look 
Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit
I think too much TV is what ruins kids
When homosexual actors is their influences
We need community centers that teach the music biz
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit
Dont take no hand outs you build it its more lucrative
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit
You get abused long enough you start abusing shit
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way
He shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
No separation 
Who Who Who Who
You You You You
Divide and conquer 
Me Me Me Me
Its the Art of War 
Us We We
Who detached us
Look 
Death is the destination we all share No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Lifes change agent It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life
Dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking
Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition They somehow already know what you truly want to become Everything else is secondary
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
It was their farewell message as they signed off
And now I wish that for you
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish

To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know
With my muscle youll be dazzled but hustlins a hassle
Percocet Demerol capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you they runnin with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those incarcerated who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder
Upstate he take showers
Baby moms on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man facetoface through the glass
On the phone 10 years he got chasin that cash
Cocaine he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash
It wasnt 911 but it was 911
Gave him 9 plus 1 dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in I had to find that dumb
Now Lord you know just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know

But it might lead to that R2D2 the mobsters creep through

Cause I cant be in Hells cell shout out to Mel Mel
Cash and Hell Rell Zeek doin 3 he even fell hell

To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know
Nowadays dog they raid up in the ballparks
Blaze em when they cross sharks
We raiders of the lost ark
Im like a ballplayer shake up and cross narcs
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche Box
More props RIP my poor pops
Cant see his son shine like the Four Tops
My antennas will block the scanners
I got blammers youll drop your hammers
Lawyers to watch lawyers cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches Nana to watch Grandma
In pajamas I snuck out to watch Santa
Now look at Killa you gon watch Santana
Now Lord you know just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know
Now I was born by the river in a little tent
Little gate little fence I climbed over
Little scrapes little dents I got over
That was just the beginning its not over
Its been a long time comin Cam
Its been a long time riding and a long time running man
Shit done changed since The Wop and The Running Man
Since Nino Gee Money The Carter and the DuhDuh Man
Its no longer a New Jack City
Its cop fast and move that quickly or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I aint talking rap man Im coming up this road
Im talking crack man and coming up with Os
Im coming up with halves and coming up with wholes
Shit got hectic had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go I receive it move it and roll
I was comin from the Q Zeek was comin from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smash in dough
We was all on the paperrun
Yeah waiting for a change to come
Now look the change has come
The 7Pick Up Yukon the Range is come
The day has come Dipset remains the ones
Most hated by you other motherfuckers
In this game we remain its a shame cuz

Of sand drop from the hourglass

Some motherfuckers gotta die
Im an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
Im gonna put these things on you and never let up
See my momma she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E shoulda never been born
Too late big mistake in 72

Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins
Back up in her pussy
Up in the butt

A few more nuts
Im starting to panic
Im starting to sweat
Cause I dont really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells flashbacks in my head
Niggas aint want me to bein happy when Im dead
But I aint goin out unless 30 niggas die
Im dying anyway so Im thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin by the pistol
Took the motheruckin whistle

To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetary
Screams 
Shut the fuck up nigga
Cause you aint seen shit
Im bout to take this blade and staight up grip
Im holdin the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now Im mad insane red as rose as I strain for my hearbeat
To thumpetythump to pump it might burst
False alarms and no harm that will commit to the E
But now Im down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast but not that slow
I thought I had an hour but its seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my BOOM

I pray the lord my soul to keep
As time winds down to its last 24 hours
In an earth that weighs 60 trillion tons
Travelling 1037 13 mph how do you define time
What is a minute
How important is an hour when 24 hours becomes a lifetime

3120,"America the ugly raped my mother
Deceived my sister separated my brother
Murdered my children hung my father
Now they want me to rock the vote the fucks why bother
Seen the commercials for they army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said Never
My minds too sharp my brains too clever
My spine is too strong every line pulls your lever
Limitless rhymes for the indigenous the remedy
Plot gettin my money like the Kennedys
Flip it put em in stocks collect indemnities
Rock roll behold my epiphanies and
Read em and weep heat em I beat em to sleep
Mislead em til we even Steven defeat em with freedom of speech
And let em know that Im the motherfuckin firestarter
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort whats real
Only truth will set you free
Id rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
We dying over black gold they harvesting the sand
Presidents living marvelous they starving in Sudan
Its obvious you walk a blind path to oblivion
The book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon
Light my fire start my engine
When Pharoahe becomes Moses its medicine for who listens
A veteran with a mic bringing prophecies to fruition
Motivational verses under adverse conditions
Youre caught in the mainframe Ive seen the maze man
They watch you from the street lights you and your main man
The bar code around your neck same as your name brand
Youre lost in a strange land no thoughts of a game plan

Excuse me
Tell me who you really really really think is more lyrical
Cause everytime I go somebody gotta see the medical
And everytime I come Im eating everything thats edible
And if you aint already know then who be more incredible
They wanna call me crazy like Im borderline cynical
Cause how I do it and I kill em and I get incredible
And magically do it like this was another miracle
And if you dont like it then you can suck up on my genitals
Tatatatal tatatatatals
Do it little bitch and get up off your little pedestal
And whenever you see me you better salute the general
Cause I will break it down to every single little mineral
Slurp slurp slurp slurp 
Suck up on my testicle again when you see me counting money
Move the decimal again
Bout to cop another diamond out of Senegal again
Everybody saying that hes uncomparable again okay
Killing everything I think we bout to have a funeral
A lot of you niggas be doing whatever you be doing
And I dont even know what to call it just sound terrible
Lower down the coffin see we have another burial
These niggas that be rambling and babbling
I aint hearing them
And everybody know that I be handling my BI
When it come to other rappers niggas know that I be scarin them
Chop chop chop chop
Chop another beat up
Now you see the way I heat up everybody wanna meet up
Just to come inside the building and witness another killing
Then I relax and throw a shot back put my feet up
Every beat that Imma touch Imma lace
Imma never stop even with a muzzle on my face
When Im finished with this sissy Imma leave without a trace
Nigga kneel down better say grace
I go HAM

I find it hard to say
That everything is alright
Dont look at me that way
Like everything is alright
Cause my own eyes can see
Through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see
Is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap
And easy to be wasted
As history repeats
So foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say
Against these laws of man
Cause like the Bible says
His blood is on their hands
And what I gotta say
And what I gotta say is rebel
While today is still today choose well
And what I gotta say is rebel
It cant go down this way
Choose well choose well choose well
Choose well choose well choose well
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete
And nothing and no one can replace it

Smoke up a pound and leave you bitch niggas in disbelief
Inhale the smoke and every word I wrote came out dope

Got my women walkin dibs on da strip with steady toes
As I roll up cranking is thinking the bigger financial expertise
Plenty money workin for G and whoever next to me

Able to hook em like cable cause Sinister Def aint stable

Picking and kicking a style I be licking and shaking and baking and making it rain
Simple and plain I smoke em like hickory dickory dock its time to clock
So brothers I mop the bigger they drop so stop Tung Twista pop
Gotta be that it be lyrical hiphop
Rocking a rhythm Imma stopdrop Im gonna give em a pop
Flowing this up and breaking the suckers up off of the mic and then rip it to shreds
I be kicking and making the people come off in a rage
And my lyrical magic Im making and moving I label this funky
Oh this dope rhythm I throw be pumppumppumping em up in the mind
And be bringing em up into hypeness
This funky tempo I throw I know that I be slapping the dope hypeness up in em
And then Imma bend em a lyrical rhythm
I throw with the tongue be leaving em hung among
This style I be throwing to tangle the mind of a sucker
Then label it lyricalism and scoping em in a prism
And giving a lyrical flow thatll fizz em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up only my lyric was left
My Tung Twista is def first let me take a deep breath
Flowing the lyrical magic of mine I be mopping and sweeping
And breakin em up and then makin em break in a sweat
I be makin em jump and then sit up and lift the style
I be kicking and popping the rhythm Im rocking and pumping
The lyrics I put up inside em be making em rock
And a flow of the rhythm Im bringing into the mic
Im gonna give em a concept never let a con step
To what I be giving the crowd that be making em hype and then leaving a con swept
Breaking the suckers up into chunks I be leaving em sinking deeper than south
Im gonna twist this up funky TT be runnin off at the mouth
Indeed 
Run off run off run off run off at the mouth

Listen to the tongue twist twisting is the Tung
Because of my trickery my tongue is slippery
This style is wild I brung
Terrible tragical mystical magical wreck in a second
The ladies Im checking and trickin
You think that Im sickenin hoes be kickin in when I stick it in
I got the enemy jumping like Jiminy like it was ten of me
Try to be friend of me sucking my simile
If Im ill then give me the remedy
Im baking like Daxon waxin giving em facts just like a lawyer
Cause Sinister Def be runnin off at the mouth like Latoya
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Bbbuck em down see buck em down
Come again
Here I be coming a radical phenomenon fillimeter
Be making a magical matter be that I be
Ratatattat come flow with my tongue energy I
Crush them them cant overcome the power to hum
And then breaking the minimum competitor G
Miracle metamorphosis is breaking em off in this
Lyrical matter becoming a rhythmous venomous pop quiz
Im rocking this as of his and cracking em up with a plop fizz
Lyrical wiz never a wannabe gonna be ripping em up into particles
Then Imma come in the pitiful puppets mind
Seeking a rhythm and you shall find
Rocking the funk of the rhythm me stamina cramming em up in a Tline
Be divine me lyrical purrrrfection a funky feline
Capping a crowd with the mic and then making em mangle
Pumping a fist they tangle
Lyrics so funky even Bojangles
Leaving angels spinnin my tongue
And if you never coming to cheer me I say cheerio hero
Me rhythm will float like a boat lets see how he flow
My freedom of speech Imma reach up against your lyrical flowing a styler
Jamming and dropping a rhythm and popping em up with the funk of a wilder
Holy sorcerer oughta come get with the funk of a slow solo
Bolo wanna throw but I show that a funky pro go still wanna flow Oh no
Sloow ohoh I step when sending men deeper than south

3601,"WAR Lyrics
Okay
Yeah
We are renegades this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades never slaves this means war
Onehundred percent uncut raw
Fuck limited freedom nigga we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army motherfucker this means war
I got a middle finger for mass media mute the news
Cause When The Gun Draws received a million views
Which gives me the right to break the rules
Say fuck radio if the people cant pick and choose
While BET gets screwed by Viacom
The new revolutionary is shyaman
Its not brush fire rap its five alarm
Motivational music after I am gone
My inner visions mysticism call me Mr Wisdom
They wanna turn the globe into a prison
And being sick is better than being dead
Cause when you sick and in bed youre indebted to meds
Cloned chickens walking around without heads
The food is contaminated the water got lead in it
Population control make the babies sick
RFID chips RU486
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul sort of a psychological dictatorship
And we are on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime said
We are renegades this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades never slaves this means war
Onehundred percent uncut raw
Fuck limited freedom nigga we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army motherfucker this means war
Alhamdulillahs a spiritual calling
My alternate and we are still mourning
Its not a documentary about global warming
This is lunar explosions of global warning
So when the moon leaves you cant tell night from morning
Cities submerged underwater post New Orleans
Its not your average rap recording
This is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons
While the American dream remains dead and dormant
My stimulis supplied by my endorphins
The minds eye greater than pi and broadband
I break on through to the other side without doormen
Its not The Doors man
I am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins
With more keys to open more doors than four foremen
To executives rooms where they walking on all fours man
Canines standing upright amongst you
Hated by swine spreading the H1N1 flu
On some rabies shit RU486
Population control make the babies sick
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul sort of a psychological dictatorship
And I am on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime
We are renegades this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades never slaves this means war
Onehundred percent uncut raw

1266,"Lost Control Freestyle Lyrics
Some of yall already know what time it is though
What up
What up Its for hiphop
House Gang what up
I love this shit man
Black Hippy what up Joey 
It go
Soul of a 70s number man I can throw a curve underhand
This for the streets not Summer Jam
This aint for the fans that wanna hear pop and snap
Drunk off Ciroc and the Yak all yall can watch from the back
This aint for self proclaimed legends that nobody wanna hear from
Scared Get a gun come to peers I got none
This aint for bandwagon fans sit yall asses in the same spot
Yall the same niggas made Trinidad Jame hot
This aint to Kendrick Lamar the nigga Kendrick got bars
I heard his shit and wasnt offended at all
And as it played I heard him say I wasnt mentioned with yall
Joell started it only right I finish the job
So all that shit is revocable from an overview
Only thing noticeable is how he barely gave me any quotables
I state facts not to say its wack but check the playback
Outrhyming AAP aint showing me where your weight at
Im on my shit today you the king of New York
You might as well had spit on Biggies grave couldnt let that slip away
Im in the court of public opinion ready to click and spray
Light Jay Elec ass up thats my Exhibit A
Bitch kill my vibe is what you wanna get into
Drown em all in a swimming pool full of phlegm and drool
You renting jewels whats with all the fascination
So when I ask you bout it thats my cross examination
This a scrimmage to me all these blemished MCs
Infamously its about image I see
But if its bars not about bread to hell with the wealth
Put you inside of the bullet just to see a shell of yourself
I mean uh since rap has been accessible
They actions been regrettable this is what the netll do Uh 
Chick sending message to tricks aint get to see em
They aint even artists and they get paid per diem
We talking bars then this whole conversation changed
Fuck all the subliminals now nigga saying names
Some of these OGs I laugh at yall dont know me to half ass
To me its just one Joey thats bad ass
King of New York my nigga stop it 5
Keep it funky Drake washed you twice
Tell me Tyler that fire with saliva I reply dont bring a lie around
Run up on Meek with the silencer nigga quiet down
Then ride off with his intro playin
Cause I get hype to that shit dog I ride to that shit
With nightmares I wanna be at the root of em with the mag off
Know he love Philly so Im leavin him with Black Thoughts
We talkin bars Niggas better get help
They put they guts all on the track still they never get felt
Lot of lower tier rappers tryna rep for they belt
Nigga theres levels to this shit dog you said it yourself
But check it when it comes to control I might have lost a bit
Law abiding citizen style Im coming for all of it
Running in your studio engineer that recorded it
Yes men that supported it any blog that reported it
Any artist he tourin wit snuff whoever bought the shit
Whoever thought of it his mentor whoever taught him it
Interrupt with a sneeze hiccup fart even cough or lick
If I got it twisted you coming to contort the shit
But the irony yall all inspire me
Yall in a spot a lot of us aspire to be
We just striving my G tip my hat so yall know its real
Fuck whoever mad you said how we all suppose to feel
I know the game somell try to get amped
You push the envelope some of us provided the stamp
The predecessors wrote the letter others sealed it shut
Some was nice without the percs before Amil got touched
Its hiphop should blame on the mic these niggas hands on
Shades that they wear in the club couches they stand on
You mixed credibility with dead ability
Raise the bar like you on par with this level of agility
Old UNLV Runnin Rebel artillery with Augmon at the 2
What sparring yall wanna do
Get to arguing with a Spartan play it cool
I heard them alien voices Ill knock the martian up outta dude
Separate the beast from the timid its hip hop
Fuck if your car is lease or rented at least you in it
Foaming at the lips looking like the yeast in women
Dont be facetious most of yall been a feast from the beginning
This is for BIG Suicidal Thoughts Coogi printed
This for Nas army jacket with the uzi in it
Not no Shiny Suit shit this that 92 Knicks
This for Hovs missing 92 bricks
For State Prop and Beans to when the LOX first burst on the scene
For Queens Pac and even EDI Mean
This for the Mobb and the purple tape word to Inspectah Deck
This aint for the labels nah Wu said protect ya neck
This aint a diss I dont want it to get spun wrong
And this for Big L the block that Joe found Pun on
This shit is for Stack I aint talking a G
Nigga Im talking a G My nigga talking on me
This is for every living rapper ever walked in these streets
And any outsider that happen to think that a portion is sweet
Niggas been killed for less and got a coffin for free
If you ever been in the hood I think we all should agree
This for every nigga that took what you said in stride
I couldnt abide some of us still take pride check it
Limbsll get crushed hip hops adrenaline rush
Menll get touched so if you feminine hush
Project benches I trust came from syringes and dust
So who you named shouldnt be mentioned with us
But wait at least half of em other half rapped around
Dual clips that wrap around gather every rapper round
See what happen when niggas try to go toe to toe
This what happen when you let a blood bath overflow
Used to do lines how could they wanna go blow for blow
I could overdose and still drag you niggas comatose
This is lightweight put the bucks up
Cause if we talking bars lot of yall should shut the fuck up
This is lightweight put the bucks up
If we talking bars lot of yall should shut the fuck up

3442,"Everybody got the memo Michael Myers man Im mental
Messy murder monumental mixed my mind
Metamorphosis made it mainey my many maneuvers
Missin my malice malevolent mister N9ne
Mediocre motherfuckers my motive makin minimal
Maniacal makin me mesh my line
Monster Musical massacre
Metaphysical man you may never match my grind
When Im bustin you think Im poppin the E
Hoppin to N9na boppin need no stop and lockin the B
Niggas be droppin off in a coffin talkin to me
Better flee never see Tecca Neez I be forever
Look at the KOD demolish Im polished
I get dollars I get the guala mixologist and many I sell
You will never see the light of day right away
You will die but I hide away say goodbye Ill see you in Hell 
True shots awhos stopped the crews water
You soft I move rocks a Moustapha
Boondock ya boo SooWoo what the
Through chakras you lost the new nana
Out with the weak and in with the raw
Put you in deep and have your mama seekin the law
Freaking the beat I get to peekin
Leavin you mauled with the saw
Aint nobody beatin me in a brawl
Yall got to know I stop the show
Pick you off of the pillar you know I drop the foe
Sick of an abyss of sicker suckers sock a ho
Nigga oh you aint even in my optical
Ill shock ya though I rock the flow
Nah not so low like burnin optimo
Wassup to Joe from my block the MO
I did it to death and my nigga I got to go
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you dont know the truth
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage
It can be an emergency making you have to evacuate the premises killing the audience up on the stage
We are an anomaly coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
You gotta be loving the cut if I get to fucking em up
Im probably bustin em up and vodka be up in the cup
And drama be nothing to us
A combination of some oddities coming to crush
And yall will be nothin to touch your body we cutting em up
Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted
Like we bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck
Whenever you recollect it me and Tech will tackle niggas
And see em like Liam Neeson in Taken
Or Taken 2 better yet Tekken 2
Wrecking you like I was Baek or Eddy
Im ready to reappear like I was Yoshimitsu
From a darker side of the universe
You are versus a predator is what you didnt know
When they will go and get you
Then Im immediately about to punish him run its a mutation
Of horror thatll treat you like a ho and hit you
But Tech me and you can speak on it even type of terminology
And hurt em as if they didnt know we were an odyssey or an oddity
Its a murder probably if not then I bet you that we cause a verbal lobotomy
Tell them niggas to make a move then when I move I wanna bruise
And show em they finna lose and I refuse to be a fool
I kill em and keep it cool but Ima do what Ima do
Because Im breakin the rules lets go
Bust you with lyrics how I shoot this
Or either we gon say fuck you while chucking up the deuces
The booth is where the living proof is and Im ruthless
I can leave your whole teams caduceus in nooses ooh its
Somebody you dont really want to get into it with
Im mythical difficult and I dont know if itll
Be a wise thing for you to do as far as tangling with the unusual
Orion Im iron Im scientifical
Indivisibility within the infrastructure of the family
That I created is inevitable
Especially if we committed to getting money
So fuck the haters because its the paper that you better get you
Take your mental into space and leave it alone
An outer dimension because I can get deep with a song
The look of a fiend Ima put em to sleep with the chrome
Unlock the machine fuck him if he aint breathing alone die
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you dont know the truth
Its a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage

The streets stay cold
Everybody turn sinner
So you can feel the heat
So a better you go simmer
Cause everybody ready fi dem lunch and dinner
Every other day we see the sign of the time
No mutherfucker you not gonna take mines
Every other day we see the fake ass lies
Run it all day red eyes on the prize
Welcome everybody to the rap crucifixion
Every other day its like a brand new conviction
Another nigga down cause he just didnt listen
We the same mission trying to get out of his position
Listen it doesnt matter if youre Muslim or Christian
Everybody need a little food in the kitchen
Hindus and Jews they all feel the tension
And any other race or religion I didnt mention
You hit the streets try to earn a little cheddar
Hoping that the cheddarll make your life a little better
Walking through the hood in the hundred dollar sweater
Looking at these cats that youre trying to stay ahead of
See what youre facing is a wild situation
The hardest thing to do is try to be a little patient
Life is like a track and everybody racing
You about to get caught by the same shit you chasin

Money cash hoes the Guantanamera

Everyone still want the Benz and the Range
Everybody still want the gems and the chains
Everybody got a few friends in the game and they still act strange
The only thing different is the color of the Tims
The only thing different is the size of the rims
Now we got Foxy Browns and Little Kims
But they still fight like Antoinette and Mc Lyte

Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they quotes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix with my sack for the whole day
Drivebys that was road rage

867,"Hope you can hear me loud and clear while I give you this talk This talk 
I hope I leave enough fuel for all the minds I will spark Will spark 
And whileâIâcomeâto share withâyou the realestâwords from my heart My heart 
I hope youre ready for this truth cause its bout to get dark Get dark 
Yo Yo 
Yo Yo 
Yo Yo 
They say the world bout to end right End right 
Well let me get this shit off before it do Before it do 
Look I had to compile this shit in a song
Its so intriguing all this fuckin satanic shit goin on
Playin with symbols and signs devil worshippin
People talk like thy prayin to Lucifer but what happened to Jsus Walks
Yeah we have demented thoughts then you conversate with your savior
Askin for forgiveness while displayin blasphemous behavior
At first we seen it subtle now niggas display it major
And goin out they way like they doin Satan a favor
And gamble with they life like rattlin dice in a shaker
Another life forsaken turnin your back on your maker
Im only tryna cater to the facts and shit
Im seein a lot of questionable shit like the fuck these niggas believe in
But now we dont figure the same your music is lifeless
And your visuals lookin like rituals and sacrifices
Makin deals with the Devil in exchange to be the nicest
You dead like your flesh was eaten by maggots and lices
Weve all witnessed the change now nobody wanna be righteous
The days we live is dark and unquestionably a crisis
The Devil tried to plant the fear from when we was in diapers
And some grew up possessed staring in the Eye of Osiris
Now I know you see this shit while you sit and wonder what happened
Its strange how niggas brandish devil worship like a fashion
The signs of the times clouds from the heavens open
Where birds fall from the sky and fish die in the ocean
Now who you think you foolin We seein the way youre movin
I hope you take the time to start thinkin bout what youre doin
Youre playin with a match that can grow into an inferno
Undescribable the burn when the fires feelin eternal
I hope you document this and write it down in your journal
And read it back to yourself while overcomin your hurdles
Now trust me and be careful of who you let in your circle
Cause the Devil fucks a life and will breed the pussy thats fertile
I know its gettin cold and youre fightin the war internal
Body decayin turnin all grey and blue even purple
You portray a lotta shit with no rehearsal
But in life we dont rehearse what you do can come back and hurt you
And until then watch how the Devil will work through
Look at what youve become and what the Devil gave birth to
And when it hits the fan youll be wonderin where your folks went
Your niggasll disappear when the science gets kinda potent
Im just buildin I aint mean to give an earful
Just carryin out my duty everybody just be careful Be careful

Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
And I do get better the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt as long as you let her 
Do my thing with an 89 swing
The dopeness I write I guarantee delight
To the hiphop maniac the Uptown brainiac
In full effect MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition youll find them in the hospital
Visiting time I think its on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And Ill blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and Ill lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say come on
Ive got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time Ill eat you up with a rhyme
But Ill let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on thats suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok lets say you didnt know what you were doing
Youre new in town and youre looking around
For another name to ruin and its me that youre pursuing
Well well well Ill be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital LYTE
And its shocking Im the one youre mocking
Oh yes Ive been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back its plain to see
That youre a wannabe but you cant be what youre not
So you better start living with what you got
Yeah DJ KRock when you hear a scratch
Now its time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And youre the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the nonbeliever
That Im a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So dont ever second guess me
And if youre wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And Ill bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light Itll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night
Kick this tip
Kick this one here for me and my DJ

Yeah every other day another star is born
And thats to freshen the decayin of the art form
Fuck with my commas shit will be quick
Got whats in my pocket out of the dirt filthy rich

Double entendre Im tryna vocally smoke you you will be missed
The hocus the pocus magician doing tricks in this miserable business
Who spit loyalty forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom paintin pictures of this
Historical war of attrition whos just the dopest the wokest
Im five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
Cause I didnt want her I needed her though I didnt want her
Im hot as July no lie I wouldnt lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth dont expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now yall scared of them shook niggas
Jamal Crawford couldnt crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets
Uhh Best Rapper Alive broadcasts in five
Four three two one
Im fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society though I am a promise
I am a oneofone like Id say a Isaiah Thomas
You cant fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac Im thinkin of sinkin your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I cant fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
Im private when I fly I ball out like Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers we just out here mobbin like old Italians
Snatching your homies necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries Im toetotoe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this 44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contraesque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose I cant go out like Im Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware pair of Pumas on
Looking like Im aboard a Lear headed to uniform
Im so lyrically rare I spearheaded the unicorn
I was born a bold one sugarcoated
All the way Im livin put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me they say Aint nobody did this nah
And if they dont they shit been off just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I wont break a fool they dont want me to blow
But every single show they hand out like I owe em
Already paid my dues and wordings uh
But if I said it then they still wont know so I wont waste my time on you
And speakin on the level that ya never on the way they hatin so incredible
My writings on the wall to you its so illegible
Im invincible youre sleepin on me Ima stay woke
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Bring on the moes and hoes
Dont snooze or doze cause Im rippin up shows
Hold your nose dead bodies are around
I leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown
I write rhymes that shine like lipstick
So much material but not materialistic
Imperial styles I use
When the mic is lifted the crowd is amused
Come with it if you feel youre fullfledged
Or yell Geronimo and jump off the edge
Your END is near when I appear
The stage is yours but wait until the smoke clears
Rhyme sayer and Im here to lay a load
So watch a player when hes playin in player mode
Uncle Ls bad and youre soon to say
Cause I rip the mic until the tune decay

Youre not complete Im battlin a fragment
So creative and witty and outstandin
And I be demandin that youre abandoned
In the desert or a wild west town
While Im at your crib on a cherrygoround
Where will she stop No one knows
Like I said before bring on the moes and hoes
I know my ABCs and my Ps and Qs
Just chill and listen to the rhyme cruise
All aboard the cord theres a reward

In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes
The moral of the story is Ima get mines
I saw the cordless boy Im gonna house that
Your rhymes are cheesy you found em in a mouse trap
Dont try to front while the freestyles droppin
He wants to battle he must be needlepoppin
You better notify your next of kin
Cause when I begin its like a needle to the skin
If you wasnt prepared then you ought to be scared
But even if you was youre aware what the rhyme does
I remember when you was an amateur
Writin your rhymes starin at my signature
Bought the album analyzed the style
Tsktsk Achoo God bless you child
Im unique when I speak to a beat
Another rapperll fall when the missions complete
I daze and amaze my displays a faze
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays
The competition thats lost in a freestyle
Cause on the mic Im the golden child
With the magical wand that theyre callin a mic
And when MCs approach it turns into a spike

1850,"The concept of reverse racism is flawed if not absolutely ridiculous Most if not all of the negative responses from people of color toward white people are reactions to the hatred violence cruelty and brutality that they were shown by white people for centuries Much of the foundation of the modern world was built on the forced free labor of black peoples The African Slave Trade the institution of slavery colonialism its derivative systems and the multiple holocausts throughout history where whites used race as the defining reason to justify their oppression conquest and brutal treatment of nonwhite peoples are how race became such a factor to begin with
The initial claim by the oppressors followed a moral imperative so they said that people outside of Occidental and European birth were in savage and cursed conditions and that God justified the captivity of these people and the rape and pillage of their lands
Ironically these oppressors would try to discard this same God who supposedly justified this brutality in the name of Darwin whose famous line survival of the fittest was used to justify criminal behavior once the Bible could no longer be used as a hiding place for economic domination and evil intention
Spirituality and morality were replaced by capitalism and with it a conscious shift of focus toward the exploitation of the vulnerable
In order to justify reverse racism one would have to first create an even playing field undo the generations of torture terror and brutality and then judge whether or not a nonwhite person is in fact a racist This approach would require people to examine the needaddiction to feel superior to someone else for no justifiable reason and the myriad policies Spiritual political and social that it bore True dominion is self evident and not the result of sabotaging another in order to achieve it That would be an illegitimate as well as a fleeting position The Universe will eventually seek to rightbalance itself
Of course there are white people who live transcendent lives not exploiting illgotten privilege or perpetuating the sins of their ancestors who used violence and deceit as a means to gain advantage over others Humanity in proper order is obligated to acknowledge the Truth whoever it comes from be they Black White or other Righteous indignation is simply a response to longstanding evil
Much of the world is still reeling from the abuses of Imperialist selfishness misunderstanding ignorance and greed Black people remain in many ways a shattered community disenfranchised forcefully removed from context and still caged in denied from making truly independent choices and experiencing existential freedom Their natural homes just like their natural selves raped and pillaged of the resources and gifts God has given to them Interpreted through someone elses slanted lens and filter they remain in many ways misrepresented Taxation without proper representation might I remind you was the very platform of protest that began the Revolutionary War which gained this country its independence from England Anger is not only the natural response to the abuse of power but is also appropriate when there is no real acknowledgment of these abuses or deep meaningful and profound change
If we took all of what we deem horrible regarding the criminal abuses that black people have committed over this countrys history and add it all up it still does not compare to the hundreds of years of terrorism violent domination theft rape abuse captivity and beyond that black people have suffered under the ideologies and systems of white supremacy racism and slave based paradigms I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse How then does the chief offender become the judge Might does not necessarily mean right Right is right People forcibly reduced to subhuman existences so that they behave in subhuman ways helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity People like plants grow where the light is When you enclose a plant and limit its light source it will bend itself toward the light for the light is necessary for its survival This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them survival then forces them to twist andor bend toward the only way of escape
There is good And I both acknowledge and encourage the good Instead of throwing out the Baby with the bath water we do well to expose the intentionally poisoned water the Baby has been forced to soak in since its origin in these lands Americas particular brand of hypocrisy is gross double entendre 
I shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term make the IRS whole make the IRS whole knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities The entire time I thought who has made black people whole Who has made recompense for stealing imposing lying murdering criminalizing the traumatized taking them against their wills destroying their homes dividing their communities trying to steal their destinies their time stagnating their development I could go on and on Has America or any of the nations of the world guilty of these atrocities ever made black people or Africa whole or do they continue to sit on them control them manipulate them cage them rob them brutalize them subject them to rules that dont apply to all Use language veiled coercion and psychological torment like invisible fences to keep them locked into a pattern of limitation and therefore control by others You have to remain focused to cease from rage
The prosecutor who was a woman made a statement during sentencing about me not doing any charity work for a number of years during my exile A Charity work is not a requirement but something done because someone wants to I was clearly doing charitable works way before other people were even thinking about it And B Even the judge had to comment that she meaning I was both having and raising children during this period As if that was not challenging enough to do She sounded like the echo of the grotesque slave master who expected women to give birth while in the field scoop the Baby up and then continue to work Disgusting
When you are beaten and penalized for being independent or truly self reliant then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with selfreliance and a fear of true independence When you are beaten or threatened with death for trying to read a book then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with education When families are broken up by force and threat of violence then the family structure becomes dysfunctional When men who would naturally defend their women and families are threatened with castration and death then this natural response also becomes dysfunctional When looking at the oppressor is punishable by violence then examination of him and his system becomes a difficult and taboo thing to do despite every bone in your body demanding it When questioning or opposing oppression is punishable by death imprisonment or economic assassination then opposing systemic wrong in any or all of its meta manifestations is a terrifying concept Anyone forced to live so incredibly diametrically opposed to that which is natural to themselves will end up in crisis if they dont successfully find a way to improve or transcend these circumstances All of which require healing It is only by the Grace of God and the resilience of the people that things havent been worse
Much of my music if not all of it is about Love a therapeutic resolve created in response to the lack of messages encouraging people like me toward free moral agency Helping to ameliorate this condition has never been addressed through the political arena alone It is a sacrificial work that doesnt simply happen between the hours of 9 to 5 or Monday through Friday but when inspiration leads us to avail ourselves for the Truth that needs to be said Unlike the system too often contrarily demonstrates we believe that people can be and should be helped and that trauma should not be criminalized but acknowledged healed and dealt with This takes awareness sensitivity and a level of freedom in my opinion the system lacks And if we dont know or understand how to do it then we humbly refer to a higher authority
We have no desire to create humanoids turn people into machines or dumb them down so that they remain dependent longer than necessary to an antiquated system in denial of its many inadequacies and need to evolve Instead we seek to educate and shed light on the snares traps and enticements that people set up in the name of business that are intended only to catch the sleeping andor uninformed
Why would a system well intentioned wait until breakdown or incarceration to consider rehabilitation after generations of institutionally inflicted trauma and abuse on a people To me it is obvious that the accumulation of generational trauma and abuse have created the very behaviors the system tries to punish by providing no sufficient outlets for the victims of institutional terror Clearly the institution seeks to hide its own criminal history at the expense and wholeness of the abused who acting out from years of abuse and mistreatment reflect the very aggression that they were exposed to

346,"Everybody everywhere is scratching for what they can get
Did you think anybody in this town is any different
They dont give a damn who gets killed
Just as long as the dice keep rollin
The hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowin 
My name is L and Im from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave theres a big park
And if youre soft dont go through it when it gets dark
Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
Theyre sneakier than alley cats
Thats why I carry gats
Yo Im a muthafuckin fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me its all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 5050
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because Im all about ends and skins
When you got those you dont need no muthafuckin friends
If I catch you on a late night black youre getting stuck jack
My moms told me to get a job fuck that
Ayo picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob selling corn on the cob
Yo how the hell Imma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man Id rather do another hit
I want clean clothes mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo I admit Im a sucker
A low down dirty sneaky doublecrossin connivin muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasnt poor I was po I couldnt afford the or
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene took his brand new ring
Cause sticking ups an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beatup ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him Give up the dough before you get smoked
Oh youre broke gunshots
Now youre dead broke
The Big L was called crazy
A topnotch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I dont care Ill do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck cause I dont give a fuck
Some say Im ruthless some say Im grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
Cause I was livin the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
Word
All of us from Harlem
139
Thats living the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
KnawhatImsayin
This goes out
To my brothers
Big Lee and Don Ice
Reggie Reg TC Todd Lou Black Tone
Whitey Ty Speeder Ru Dog Herb McGruff
EJet G Love Doc Ring Slice and Rich Dice
I cant forget the 140 Lennox Ave crew
And I gotta say rest in peace to Mate the Skate Dog
And my man Kerry peace

Now what kinda life is that for a child

3270,"Okay Ace one last question before we wrap this one up is
Considering how long youve been in the game all the places you been
And all the songs that youve done and all the cats youve worked with
Is there anything that youd do differently
What I mean to say is do you have any regrets
If I never recorded another song
If I was wrong and nothin I spitted was ever strong No Regrets 
If I never perform at another venue
If this genuine love doesnt continue No Regrets 
If none of my records was ever sold
If I fold and never see platinum or even gold No Regrets 
If no one ever again can recall if I stalled
And start workin part time at the mall No Regrets 
If theres no more shows for be to dabble in
No more travelin even the show in Maryland
If none of my songs that ever been never spin
In heavy rotation ever again No Regrets 
If I dont do a song to insight millions
Or get a video done by Hype Williams
If theres never a chance again to be seen
On the pages inside of another magazine No Regrets 
If the luxuries in life I cant of course afford
If I never win a Billboard or a Source award
I wouldnt want ya pity or ya sympathy
Even if Marley never put me on The Symphony
But I gotta admit it Im glad he did it
Its considered the first verse I ever spitted
I realize that Im still apart of history
I learned the key to victory its not a mystery
You see I got alotta love for what I do in life
And after this then Imma find somethin new in life
I guarantee it will be somthin that I really love
I give thanks for my life to God up above
That Im blessed to have a job that I enjoy doin
And now as a man doin what I was a boy doin
The only difference is now I get to eat from it
I never thought I would be known on the street from it
But if not one fan that shows gratitude
And when they see me they walk by with an attitude No Regrets 
It was still an enjoyable ride
Yeah big up to Kane Biz Mark and The Pharcyde
And of course to all of my past label mates
Hope Yall keep on risin like the cable rates
Ay yo Premier and Guru this goes out to you
Special Ed and Buckshot this a shout to you
I dont know if its the end but yo it might be
Big up to QTip Ali Shaheed and Spike Lee
And everybody in the game I ever worked with
And all the chicks up in the game I used to flirt with
But if I never get another piece of show coochie
Dont see no Louie Vuitton or no Gucci No Regrets 
No more suede and linen or designer denim
No more Jeeps with 1000 watt systems in em No Regrets 
No more sittin on chrome with them Parelli shoes
No more gettin my name up in the daily news No Regrets 
No more Lexus Coups Beamers and Benzes
No more Cardiae frames with colored lenses No Regrets 
No more chains and bracelets and no baguettes
For what its worth yo I got no regrets No Regrets 
No Regrets 
No Regrets

No Regrets

3535,"Ayy in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when its a few of us
She let me fingerfuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us we wanted one thang
Just penetratin that throat dawg
She choked on it like smoke dawg
But whenever I fucked up my reup
In a dice game I go see her
Shell give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a 69
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
Why you always give your ass up
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laidthis shit dont add up
She said Tip all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it aint real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back I still fuck
And thats fucked up but she so trill
I need somethin she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga guess where we go chill
For bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds til it go down
I remember shawty she stayed down
I wont say her name cause she married now
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
She would always turn heads when shed fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And wed both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin just to see if the police comin
We got close over time her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was bout 17
I aint even have a license couldnt even drive
I was goin back and forth with each flight
Another show after show each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
Shed go through my phone and wed fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasnt really much more that we could do
Wasnt really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh one night I had a few
Yeah this little chick that caught my eye
I told her Hurry up meet me at the room
And no I didnt have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said Im pregnant
And you can almost bet she kept it
And thats the reason why you left me
On top of all that it wasnt even mine
I went and got paternity testeddamn
When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then
Wait hol up is that you
With them big ol thighs after school
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said Im in hot pursuit
You said I wont ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin for the nigga with the tallest fetti
You overlookin every nigga that aint quite ready
To make it rain on you like Im about to break a levee
Hol up that pussy petty
Yeah your nails did your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine ho
Tried to make some time ho
But I aint got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line ho
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggasfuck you and Mick Romney
Im grown now Im on my own now

All of the things that I did back then
When Im in my bed
I think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things I did back then

1732,"She tossed the flamer 94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast gas released a rat deceased
Back on the street back on her feet
Clappin the heat
Shes dressed to kill
Icedout head to toe a snake in black
Shes cleared to get ill
Shes about the dough the black widow
Yo she was a tight bird female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the earn rockin all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shining with light blurs from off her fingers
Honey was off the ringer the way she tossed the flamer
94 walked into danger behind the war fort with a banger
Trapped in the beast gas released a rat deceased
Back to the street back on her feet
Clappin the heat from the back seat in back of a jeep
Stackin the heat pilin the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence your tongue
Convoys of black limos
Armed boys strapped with mack millos
Bustin off caps through a cracked window thats the MO
Push your wig back make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin to map the dividend flow and where the ends go
Checkin on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when MAC10s blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web killin for bloodspill a black widow
Kool G Rap 
Shes out for blood dressed for the kill to kill bustin slugs 
Icedout shit is real head livin crime to toe life of crime 
A snake droppin heads in black pullin nines 
Shes cleared dodgin heat to play the street 
Get ill let the guns blow had to eat 
Shes about copped the raw the dough went to war 
The black widow beef no more cold fours at your door 
She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto kiddo
Step out of line kitko she spit nines and shidells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamondstud shinin the clito the web spinnin
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom known for bustin the lead grinnin tilted red brimmin
Makin the lights inside of your head dimmin
Givin head to men and leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen sippin gin with a shread of lemon
Deadup thoroughbred slim and trim and stackin cake like Emmingers
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola mezzanine shes with binoculars
You even think about poppin her stoppin her moppin her droppin her
Hard with bodyguards divin on top of her
Cops in they BluBlockers watchin her steady clockin her
Jock her dreamin of knockin her thinkin a scheme for knockin her
Dress provocative show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow strike of the black widow
She held a white weddin
Type settin just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the breadn from her last rice on her headn
All types of presents striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggas necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin her central book files
Beef them niggas cook wild groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem makin her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed first class Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down holdin her shirt gaspin hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin the facts are real though
Got her cap peeled for stackin real dough
Lifestyle brillo when youre rollin for krill dough
Death of a black widow

2755,"Hate It or Love It GUnit Remix Lyrics
Yeah lets take em back
Uhhuh
Comin up I was confused my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy aint around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed Id get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs Id get the hat now thatd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggas had stole my bike
Different day same shit aint nothin good in the hood
Id run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate Id carry the heat for ya
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya GGGG for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my NWA gold
I had the whole crowd yellin Free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And Im raps MVP
Dont make me remind yall what happened in DC
This nigga aint Gotti he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouthtomouth
Hahaha
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
From the beginnin to the end losers lose winners win
This is real we aint got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change its stayin the same
How many of them boys is witcha
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
Im walking with a snub cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club til they coughin on the rug
Aint never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now its an RIP shirt in my coat
Now Im speedin reminiscin
Holdin my weed in never listen
If I see him Imma lift em
And maybe thatll even the score
But if not itll be me on the floor
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deucedeuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus rockin a leases
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God Im blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know Im still nice with my cook game
Look man its a hood thang thats why Im loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey Im still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put em in my fofive
And I aint even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who aint seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me

654,"It go off with my sabbatical
Took a few years cause Slaughters what I had to do What up 
Which only brings me to now and I oughta be erratical
I say that cause my autobiographical is more so just a graph of you
I aint mad you did more than what I asked of you
As for me I did less than what I couldve
So though we were a hit had to cancel that show
And now my standards so low I be amped when she not a hoe
But what you doing right now is real commendable takes strength to do
Cause between us theres some deep roots there
I gave you the best dick you ever got in your life
And stupid me thought it would be enough to keep you there
I thought you loved football I was running through the hole with the stiff arm
But got disarmed guess it was just harm
I aint need to fuck I was looking for a peer
They say once you stop looking what you looking for appears
You were stronger than I pictured you much stronger than me
And almost just as strong as John
And John oh thats just a friend of my moms
With tubes coming out his nose but shit I never knew why
But he was born with his heart on the right side of his chest
No for real his hearts in the right side of his chest Word 
Doctors confused aint much that they can do
But impute and say it aint on the right side of his chest
Scared he might die in his sleep deep
Every time he cough wonders if its a cough or its a symptom
Us well get better later
He gon live his whole life waking up every morning to a respirator
So I dont never say what I cant do
If he can be happy with life than nigga I can too Fuck it I can too 
While Jos wanna die
Aint tell nobody but eyeing his eyes feel I should probably identify
Said everyday he lives with pain and wanna end it
Somethings wired wrong in your brain you gotta mend it
Had a bad breakup and let it expose dude
But if she was getting you high then she would get you low too
So whos there to wait on me
Yall just get it off yallve put the weight on me
Nigga look me in my eyes it was amazing to me
And said you dont understand you not as crazy as me
You got gall nigga Im the most mentally flawed nigga
You not even built to withstand all Ive endured nigga
You know shit about the thoughts in my head
Or the strength I need daily just to get out of bed
Just to open my eyes nigga open your eyes
The words spoken of wise you just know in disguise
We can end this right here I got nuttin more to say to ya
You aint never met another fucking nigga crazier
Blank stare couldnt believe em
Cant chastised me cause I got help when you need some
I could give less than a fuck and not a damn
I never be apologetic over who I am
Im the same me nothing changes when the riches do
But niggas wanna suck you dry just like the bitches do
They enter your mentions sucks to be the center of attention
When you cant even center your attention
Yeah so Im fucking out of frustration
They love every second and accuse me of persuasion
Jam was a cancer to me I had to rid it
Red got in her feelings fast but wont admit it
Dawn I was bored then never really smithen
V got threatened by the thought of competition
Malo wanna fuck all day dont know how
She why I got a Viagra in my wallet right now
Steph kept it simple loved me for my mental
B got a nigga but she used me as her rental
And you you just give me resistance
Say you need a comfort zone for you its distance
I tell em all Im not available emotionally
They start giving me advice like they coaching me
I dont even ask it its something bout
Bipolar sociopath shit they just find it attractive
Antisocial but I mingle now
But Ive been arguing much more since Ive been single how
Tell me is this a relationship or just a fuckship
Whatever situation it is its all fuck shit
Ill admit I might love a lil differently
As for them theyd all love to see a different me
Some cried to me some are begging for it
Some wanna see that change but not be present for it
You just act so frightened
Ignoring all logic now she wont buy in
Even in your absence my feelings are heightened
Though I know some loves lost its not on my end
Its not mine its not mine at all
",And said you dont understand you not as crazy as me You got gall nigga Im the most mentally flawed nigga You not even built to withstand all Ive endured nigga You know shit about the thoughts in my head Or the strength I need daily just to get out of bed Just to open my eyes nigga open your eyes The words spoken of wise you just know in disguise We can end this right here I got nuttin more to say to ya You aint never met another fucking nigga crazier Blank stare couldnt believe em Cant chastised me cause I got help when you need some I could give less than a fuck and not a damn I never be apologetic over who I am Im the same me nothing changes when the riches do But niggas wanna suck you dry just like the bitches do They enter your mentions sucks to be the center of attention When you cant even center your attention Yeah so Im fucking out of frustration They love every second and accuse me of persuasion Jam was a cancer to me I had to rid it Red got in her feelings fast but wont admit it Dawn I was bored then never really smithen V got threatened by the thought of competition Malo wanna fuck all day dont know how She why I got a Viagra in my wallet right now Steph kept it simple loved me for my mental B got a nigga but she used me as her rental And you you just give me resistance Say you need a comfort zone for you its distance I tell em all Im not available emotionally They start giving me advice like they coaching me I dont even ask it its something bout Bipolar sociopath shit they just find it attractive Antisocial but I mingle now But Ive been arguing much more since Ive been single how Tell me is this a relationship or just a fuckship Whatever situation it is its all fuck shit Ill admit I might love a lil differently As for them theyd all love to see a different me Some cried to me some are begging for it Some wanna see that change but not be present for it You just act so frightened Ignoring all logic now she wont buy in Even in your absence my feelings are heightened Though I know some loves lost its not on my end Its not mine its not mine at all,It go off with my sabbatical Took a few years cause Slaughters what I had to do What up Which only brings me to now and I oughta be erratical I say that cause my autobiographical is more so just a graph of you I aint mad you did more than what I asked of you As for me I did less than what I couldve So though we were a hit had to cancel that show And now my standards so low I be amped when she not a hoe But what you doing right now is real commendable takes strength to do Cause between us theres some deep roots there I gave you the best dick you ever got in your life And stupid me thought it would be enough to keep you there I thought you loved football I was running through the hole with the stiff arm But got disarmed guess it was just harm I aint need to fuck I was looking for a peer They say once you stop looking what you looking for appears You were stronger than I pictured you much stronger than me And almost just as strong as John And John oh thats just a friend of my moms With tubes coming out his nose but shit I never knew why But he was born with his heart on the right side of his chest No for real his hearts in the right side of his chest Word Doctors confused aint much that they can do But impute and say it aint on the right side of his chest Scared he might die in his sleep deep Every time he cough wonders if its a cough or its a symptom Us well get better later He gon live his whole life waking up every morning to a respirator So I dont never say what I cant do If he can be happy with life than nigga I can too Fuck it I can too While Jos wanna die Aint tell nobody but eyeing his eyes feel I should probably identify Said everyday he lives with pain and wanna end it Somethings wired wrong in your brain you gotta mend it Had a bad breakup and let it expose dude But if she was getting you high then she would get you low too So whos there to wait on me Yall just get it off yallve put the weight on me Nigga look me in my eyes it was amazing to me
3102,"Yeah the universe let the planets align
Spent 10k and the card didnt decline
Bartender one Casamigos and lime
Im celebrating gracefully getting better with time
I aint even halfway through this incredible ride
But like Im kind of doing an incredible job
When I was eighteen living beyond my means
I was afraid of my dreams looking at the finer things
Wishing I could l flip to a microchip from a paper clip
Upgrade to a spaceship from a basic whip
Cash rules everything I just wanted a taste of it
Fast food hurrying saving time not wasting it
Selfsaboteur speaking it to my paramour
Torch rappers like Im igniting the aerosol
Maintaining the wherewithal that embarrass yall
Gamechanger the way I shredded your cabbage off
Explaining is changing apples to applesauce
When we were young innocence was ours but that was lost
Where I reside is the dark side of the glory
The fury I manipulate is the arc of the story
Written without a ghostwriter to author it for me
This is crime and punishment Im the judge and the jury
Listen Dostoyevsky
I swam with crocs fished with sharks
May never pop charts but I know Im popular
I was built to run the game I came up playing guard
With young niggas between 55 and 6 foot 4
I banked over both tryna bank over some more
And ball out in something gorgeous thatll keep me in court
Where theyll judge like yall does yall dont know me enough
Yall still owe us for what all yall did to the Cold Crush
To my donuts Im shooting J Dillas and what
I wanna cop when I get loot and recoup
I had to go through hella doors so in short thats why I only want two
But I aint got Jay number I CC em the proof
Cause everything I pictured in my head has always come true
They say you need vision to see eye to eye with the Druids
Spent 25 hundred on sheep skin let it seep in
I aint turn starboy in a weekend
It took more like 7 years make a sane man drink Everclear
It aint ever clear if we ever guaranteed a year
Fruits of your labor huh you work hard to get it
Jamla stitched on the motherfucking ROC fitted
Before the big lights it had to start with the scrimmage
Know that itd come sooner or later Im Trae Young nigga
Huh Im Trae Young nigga
Uh I said Dostoyevsky meets Joe Pesci
Tired of staring at a glass half empty
Turning me from Dr Sebi to cocking semi
It got me clutching my machete from the Serengeti already
Wild Styles and Fab Five Freddy
Im a stranger in Moscow dont ask how deadly is the ummah
Patrice Lumumba Kwame Nkrumah
To the Tripoli shores from the halls of Montezuma
Stop intruder Im built on facts Im not your rumor
A malignant tumor slid through in a suede Puma
The steady heavy legendary all praise is overdue
Same cloth as the chosen few rap Noble Drew
I guarantee you know more music by the suckers
Its not a victimless crime if anybody suffers
In a system that was designed for them to try to cuff us
Well whats the use of em trying when cant nobody touch us
Unless its fabricated probably drug related
But love or hate it I will not be subjugated
When they screamin You the greatest that did it whats underrated
As if every other player who spit it was unrelated
If every mans a temple the circumstance is simple
So to be transcendental I do enhance the mental

3025,"Ay dont let the hat and shoes fool you sir
I grew up with this anarchyâletâme school youâsir
Baboons are sure to move onâyou if you unsure
Truth is elusive you could loosen up to Lucifer
You dont survive where Ive been halfblind and my grin
Different environments without knowing the signs of violence
All that nonsense is not where Ive been tryin to go
But your boys just gotta know not to think that I the ho
If my eyes are closed and I start nodding slow
I aint blow no kind of dro
Im trying to get my drumsticks to rock and roll
Leafing through the cosmos read it like its Cosmo
Everything I see I know is deposited inside my soul
It pushed me to the threshold
I know just what the spirit does when the flesh folds
Break the scale Im only playing the best notes
From distress to effervesce mode

Uh huh yeah
Twinkle in the ivories
You know what a twinkle in my eye could mean
And what defines my dreams
The second they describe the scene I bought it sight unseen
And provide the means for driving with the highest beams
Uh I revealed it in the silent stillness
Uh I dry my shield and then they fought me fearless
Uh I read about it til I finally feel it
Uh inside the secrets of my life experience
Uh them ones I thought were masters go and show they ass aroma
If I dont back up off you then Im after smashing on ya
Dont be sad because the magics over
Im still on the path and better than I had been if I hadnt known ya
As a teacher you mastered it all
Taught us how to climb and showed us how to fall
If you should drop a line and I dont grab the call
Ill catch you on the other side when youre standing tall
Yes yall
It pushed me to the threshold
I know just what the spirit does when the flesh folds
So alive close the eyes and let the breath flow
Give and forgive or get and get forgetful

I know just what the spirit does when the flesh folds
Human being is created in the best mold

Am I rising or they comin down
I see death around the corner

What do I do now Who gon find me how
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one its true
Im number 92782
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate aint my favorite food
But Im hungry so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads Dont cry stay tuned
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life

I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife
Rest in paradise

We toot our own horns rumbumbumbum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like Dundundundundun
Dont call it a comeback
It was dark now the sun back
Hit me hard but I punched back
The wheels fell off I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or its do or die
Its newer days and its bluer skies
I told myself Its just you and I
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who Im there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew Id find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Cant control the tears let em drop and roll Let em drop and roll

But if you know me you know that Im liable
To bust a cap cause its all about survival of the fittest
Im a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I repo your Vette then jet
Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue but they cant catch me yet
Cause Im slick and slippery
They cant get with me cops aint shit to me

And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad mad cause Im the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKas Most Wanted

Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you face to face head to head
Mic to mic I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn Beats nitro
Lyrics weak say goodnight yo
Star Trek shades man cut the joke
Lets get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pit bull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr Pitiful
Heres some mouthwash G
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap C
AUSE youre riding me
TODD junior Moe Dee
Stop biting chewing swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son I need jock relief
Heres a toothpick now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it Yeah finished Burp 
Now let a real man go to work
Cause Im a whip you like your daddy beat ya like a baby
Sic ya like a dog dropping lyrics with rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause youre nothing but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
Im a treat ya like a hooker punk change your clothes
Put you on the streets in with ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and Ill keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
Youre trying to come off and dont know how to come
Youre young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
Ill do you with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
My lyrical beat down will leave ya in a coma
Cause you cant hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue youre out of your league
Youre running out of gas and youre tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause hes petro
Take youre whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies tears or violins
Get your black suits cause I aint smiling
Im shooting the gift of gab brother youre ripped in half
Soon as the mic is passed you wont live to laugh
If theres laughter Ill get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So whos got no style look at your profile
You cant dance cant dress and youre so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your game plan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you aint got a chance in hell
Youll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one one too often
Came with a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they wont show ya
When I finish your mama wont know ya
Cause Ima rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read He had no win
So RIP Rest in peace ripped em
DID dead indeed did em
An HIT hitman so whatcha hit him with 
A rhyme silencer I hit him with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
If mama said knock me out come do it
You cant win and that scratch knew it
Ima send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
Youre out of here over finished all in
And Marley Marl cant save you from fallin
Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn Another dumb move
You cant go hard youre just soso Todd
Im that type of guy Oh my God
Its gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marley hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because Im a rock up L
Low life loser life like luna
Lackadaisical listless luna
Tic liver lifeless living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league lard larcenist liar
Label ledger left the leper liar
Bull lull lateral learning
Laps languid latent lurking
Languish language local logo
Light laboring limited loco
Now LLs a laughing stock
Cause I lit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now youre down to a broken L
Your records aint hot and your shows dont sell
Yo tell em how you fell L Hard as hell 
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it whos your daddy
Kill em kill em
Make you say Daddy I dont want none 
I did em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the to the to the get him out of here
Yeah
So for all those hip hop fans out there that really know what time it is
Anybody that wants to see us get this thing going on headtohead Kool Moe Dee versus LL
Put a little pressure on him cause the boy aint got no heart
Cause he knows what time it is
And anybody out there that dont know what time it is remember
I never said the brother couldnt make a good record
But when it comes to a battle we gotta go headtohead on them lyric tip
And when it come to lyrics he cant hang

491,"Moms and pops they used to take us to church
Saying If you dont believe then the prayin dont work
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement Im first
Music brought me to my knees I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I got some issues I got problems gotta make amends
I watch my daughter giggin in the kitchen to the safety dance
This shit right here we call love
You cant put that into words but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms I watch the fallin sun
Kiss my daughter and say Thank God as I wake up
Oh I know yeah I know now
And Im up but Im aware that it goes down
Travelled round the globe I needed to slow down
And no better feeling riding round in my hometown
Hope Im feeling this good when its Monday mornin
Been doing my own thing cant say that Im sorry
And I can only pray someday that well all be
More than just okay we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
Oh my God oh my God
No other person on this earth could ever take my job
This my life it was planned I cant take it off
Bruised elbows knees scraped I learned to take a fall
My mistake my mistake
Karma waits karma waits
But Ill be brave Ill be brave
The pain seems more than I could take I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain than the gain
New state of mind I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines still pushing that 85 Lac
Windows down city passing by like a timelapse
The weatherman be trippin so that ceiling got that white rag ay
We came so far just some kids in the city tryna make some art
Leave some change in the fountain hope to make my mark
You see I was given a role never played my part
Hope Im feeling this good when its Monday mornin
Been doing my own thing cant say that Im sorry
And I can only pray someday that well all be
More than just okay we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
I can have a life to I have life today I rely on that constant communication with my higher power more so than anybody these days And I realized thats kinda all I need And then of course yall appear right yall appear things appear and situations appear And I realize thats God working through me if I allow myself to be that vessel

No tellin when the bloodshed stop glide til the sled stop
Copped the latest every hot flavor in them crocs and gators

Skylights up in the ceilings for the plants to bloom

Prison niggas that ran balloons
Shut down shop from Jan to June and still cop land in the boons
Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed self built do
Down to the mink pelts gator belts and silk suit
If I cant stack a nigga cap get peeled loose
Word to them cats that died on the street its spilled juice

The lake we build houses but its the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucka will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the Face
Where niggas do they struggle with a straight face
Surviving under conditions demons died in
You could run it but cant hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this mothafucka like pussy with no sheets cause its deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and wont surface
They let the money make em nervous whats the purpose
A mothafucka sitting on fat
Who done came up out the hood money cant come back
Fuck that I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me then take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but whats right
Surviving sitting on a ki doing business on a beeper
Im sinking in this mothafucka deeper
Fear the Reaper that no man born of woman harm me
Fuck beat these niggas in your army though Im a killer

I Strike the Empire Back
Fuck the Empire
High flying like the Millenium Falcon piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo fronting on mes a nono
Understand doing this for my family
Ha ha check it out yall
Yo Im trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up told my daddy Id be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon switch hand
Get todays solid ground out of yesterdays quicksand
I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man
On small looseleaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but nowaday its time for me
The streets is watching me I watch back thats the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seekin the North beacon
From beating and hogeating from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding cotton thorns in your palms
Its for yall that I sketch these songs and it goes
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go manoamano
Kweli is you with me What up what up 
Lets make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow looking for a brighter day
When yall wanna leave yall
Right away
Shout it out from EastWest from South to Northern 
From Cackalack to California 
From the coldest to the warmest 
To the borders cross the waters understand
and know that I love you
We got love in the place
Shout out to all the Queens all the Seeds 
To all the teams thats gettin cream 
From outlaw to emcees 
Make it happen do your thing understand
and know that I love you
Ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen
Guess who
The illest MC in the atmosphere
Yeah the Soul Controller
Who roam the frontier like a Buffalo Soldier
I follow the code of honor like a real man gonna
Never disrespect no women cause I love my momma
These cats be giving us praise but it aint that accurate
I give it up to God all that love and attachment get
Scary wellprepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to em clearly
Yall dont hear me though even when Im coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo why you starting me
I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent with the tears and sweat and what I bleed
MCs imitate the way we walk the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off
You come across soft
Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guestlist
Its like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it MCs in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know its only cause I love you
Shout it out from EastWest
From South to Northern 
From the richest to the poorest 
To the elders in the coffins 
Living native dying for it understand
And know that I love you
Yea yea we got love in the place
Shout out from up top to the middle 
To black bottom sky high 
Whether you colder than December
Or hotter than July
It dont stop til we complete this
And know that I love you
Keep this fly
Its so much to life when you just

Oh what A white girl with a flow aint been seen before
Bow down until your knees get sore
Treat Neimans like a grocery store
And Selfridges get the same rapport
Ask Bey when we off on tour
Hopping out a fly whip screaming This aint yours
How famous can one get fore she get tired
One phone call that make all the money get wired
Uh spit fire thatll burn down an empire
20 deep in the Sprinter tryin the Benz tires
Wave hello when I breeze by ya
Make enough in ten months I could live off or retire woo 
But I just wont quit
Tryna figure out which part of this you just dont get huh

It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Bow down to a Goddess bow down to a Goddess

But how the hell you play friendly when the mention of my name could cause a media frenzy
The cameras flash everywhere make it hard to miss me
Lately I been crazy tell a psych ward commit me
After any competition coming up against me
You think its anything better then come convince me
Until then Ill be leading the race
So bow down put your knee to your face
While I make wine outta water turn rappers into martyrs

33,"Doo Wop That Thing Lyrics
Yo remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like Ooh oohooh ooh 
Yo yo my men and my women
Dont forget about the deen
Sirat alMustaqeem
Yo its about a thing uh yo yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Put them up put them up 
Put them up put them up 
Put them up put them up 
Its been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Member when he told you he was bout the Benjamins
You act like you aint hear him then give him a little trim
To begin how you think youre really gon pretend
Like you wasnt down and you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even foolin him
If you did it then then youd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck sayin youre a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass cause youre thinking its a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine
Dont be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending em
Now Lauryn is only human
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
Its silly when girls sell their souls because its in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
A win win come again
A win win come again 
Guys you know youd better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Dont care who they offend poppin yang like you got yen 
Lets stop pretend the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men still in they mothers basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men
The punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
Uhuh come again Yeah 
Hey yoyo come again
My French men come again
My sister come again
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out

Hey weve got some very intelligent women here man
Do you think youre too young to really love somebody
No No no I dont think so 
I say it for me uh Im an adult I say wait
Youre too young to be in love this is silly
Youre infatuated or whatever you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I dont know
Its the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody 
Well you tell me Whats the difference
Okay You can love anybody but when youre in love with somebody youre looking at it like thisyoure taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do 
Youre crazy You fall in love you can fall out of love 
You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person 
Maybe they aint never been loved before or been in love before they dont know what the feeling is to be loved 
She poetic 
She killed it we could end that conversation with that right

Ive never really had a religious experience in a religious place Closest Ive ever come to seeing or feeling God is listening to rap music Rap music is my religion Amen
What I say might save a life what I speak might save the street
I aint got no instruments but I got my hands and feet
Hands gonna clap and feet gonna tap ElP beats to make that snap
And I ride em with my raps and they all tight as my naps
And my naps is all I got and this beautiful ebony skin
And the music in my heart and the words put in the wind
And the words put in the wind comin back like a boomerang
When I take this microphone point it at the crowd they start to sing
This is jazz this is funk this is soul this is gospel
This is sanctified sick this is player Pentecostal

I got things to do before I meet that glory in the sky
And my baby girl bday six months away she gonna be five
So I pray to the Lord he spare me and I make it by and by
And I help souls stay out of Hell with what I testify
And maybe when I grab that microphone and never lie
Thatll merit that he spare me I wont have to feel that fire
So Killa Kill gonna spit that real on each and every song
And each and every poem until the good lord call me home gone

Prison niggas that ran balloons
Shut down shop from Jan to June and still cop land in the boons
Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed self built do
Down to the mink pelts gator belts and silk suit
If I cant stack a nigga cap get peeled loose

I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where Im heading cause I know where Ive been
The flow is bone crushing its nothing I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting stunting
Its something you want 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that Im winning
Man Ive been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid control your jealousy
Cause I cant control my temper Im finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie Im down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I aint stopping
Til my clip is empty Im simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollowtip shells struck you with your bones broken guns smoking still locing
What nigga lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with lead so dont push me

Right now Im on the edge so dont push me

Fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didnt cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie I gotta get that money
Ill be damned if Im bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama tears got me heated heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas dont want me balling they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause Im a stunner I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I aint lying bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron high as a giant
Im running from nothing my stomach is touching what Im clutching
To give you more than a concussion end of discussion
My blood is colder so Im bolder
Hennessy and soda hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror I see a soldier
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
These are my ideas this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs my ears
This is me whos gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like its all fun and games til they shoot em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we aint playing
Aint saying we aint laying down at night and aint praying
I bullied my way in this game man Im done playing
Man Im done saying that Im done playing
Ima start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
Theres no way Ima back down like a god damn coward
I cant how would I look as a man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at em please
Oh whoa yo ho hold up oh no not me not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall Ill show you martial
I try to show you art but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole nother side I wanted to not show you

2629,"Look at all these haters surroundin me every day
Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all this hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
Pop the locks on the Benz steal his keys
Too high to see his own enemies
Seen his baby mama tears with a short skirt
His last ride was in a car I mean a black hearse
His friend took his life for the mighty dollar
Then ran through the alley mustve been a coward
No more hit em up like in the old days
Homies ride with Mack 10s and AKs
Thats why I roll by myself I mean alone
Cause haters be all up on
Tryna sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
And the same niggas wanna blow on your weed
Set you up for a caper
Dont wanna see you make no money then take ya
And try to figure out how to get what you got
Cause haters be the same niggas on your spot
Look at all these haters surroundin me every day
Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all the hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
How do hatin get started Its started by the jealous people
And they get mad over the things you have and the things theyll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really aint hard to get
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors Im really not impressed
I tell you only one time with my scrilla fool dont mess

I got friends that can turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me
When I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes upon my enemies I gotta watch my friends
Like when Im sittin on top or ridin a Benz
Why dont yall go out yalls ass up and get somethin
Dont worry about how I got mines
Always tryin to point a finger and say thats not mine
And kill me
It kills me
Its disgusting cause I got a few Gs
They try to rob me
But the white manll make it they wont touch em
Smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
But I just cant call it or catch
But I still got Gs and Im still ballin

898,"Tell me you love me now tell the world you love me louder
The most beautifullest things come with ugly power
For now its bubbly hour were celebrating right
Big dreamer a taste for heights
One of the greatest teachers takes advice
One of the peace MCs takes your life
Cold ass world I had to break the ice
Know that girl youre about to make a wife
Nights like this you need the pipe white six
Flip TVs to play your highlight clips
Thought Id be done taking the mob path
Man plan God laughs
Somewhere between my evens and odd clash
You give your life to the ghetto get nothing from it
The shorties run when they see me
I give em hundreds most wanted
Broke my way out of the trap
Looking for change Good I got that exact
My time is now Ill die for something
Came from nothing went to far to look back
Cant even have my style niggas took that
Get where youre going wish they could black
Rather they shoot you down another reason to fly
Reason Im never coming down again
Aint shit here for me you see me highhigh
Lifes a bitch since when you know me sweat her
I is the only letter tend to outshine
Find me the golden era
Naw I cant stop I owe that to my grandpop
The glow that made the hand hot
Beat too much soldiers in the sandbox
I got the hoes hiking dont know a flow like him
Feels like Ive been here before
Ironic Im ghost writing
Chronic and gold lightening
Illuminate Im hype when
I lose them playing them twice then
Them rules thatll cage your life in
Been feeling its my time again
Spill my survival gems
The rap game in question and Im young Iverson
My dawg in a jam and I got to ride with him
Its all out of hand when they let the rivals in
To the sky with them uh
Broke my way out of the trap
Looking for change Good I got that exact
My time is now Ill die for something
Came from nothing went to far to look back
Cant even have my style niggas took that
Get where youre going wish they could black
Rather they shoot you down another reason to fly
Reason Im never coming down again
Aint shit here for me you see me highhigh
Uh the furthest thing born perfect and I deserve it
Ran out of my mommas worth it
One of a kind design of grimy surface
They leave you a body does seem like the churches
Okay to get high just dont get out your purpose worthless
Mad man I feel like its working
Lay down my shit then leave the studio hurting
Killing in two leagues Im Julius Erving
A star was born in April
Thats what Im shooting for when
Back to the future boy
Im in the booth Im super Lloyd
Cnotes sing your hearts serenade
Samples of separation foulest shit they ever made
I spot my people the same corner we laugh pain
Said I aint lose a step knew me since half days hey
Broke my way out of the trap
Looking for change Good I got that exact
My time is now Ill die for something

3508,"Yeah you know the crazy thing is
They gon talk about you when you aint got shit
But then they gon talk about you when you got shit
And see they gon talk even when they dont know
What you had to do or what you go through
Sacrifices
Seeing your family scrambling thats sanity damaging
Gotta make a move cant just stand and be mannequin
Have a man who be managing randomly standing in places he shouldnt
Trying to move that Pamela Anderson under
Stand it be hammers in Grand Marquis paneling
Cause them niggas from the other side are fans of me vanishing
New day new funeral my grandma be panicking
But I gotta eat she just handing me sandwiches
And an appetite like mine got me scamming and scandeling
Riding shotty with my homie but I plan to be phantom and
Bumping something I can feel fam I need sampling
Not no Bieber on the hook I need Anthony Hamilton
I got molly I got white I be Hannah Montana and
Like a Migo its illegal but its grands in my hand again
So it probably aint right but this the land of the scandalous
Til your own friend a snake you probably cant understand it then
When you go youre just gone all we missing is payments
Dr King fought for my freedom that I risked just to pay rent
Aint no love for these streets aint no kissing the pavement
Yeah Im sick and tired of shit but they insist on being patient
But for what To wait on that eviction note
I wake up to some real shit them dreams I have is fictional
Unless I go and get it dont stop get it get it
2 Live Crew money and the Luke dancers with it
Jesus died on that cross thats a sacrifice
Niggas dying for their cross thats a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge thats a sacrifice
If shorty took that charge for you thats a sacrifice

Baby gotta do what a baby gotta do
Baby mama aint got it but her baby father do
Never pick up baby boy but his Mercedes power blue
Now mommy sick of daddy and baby got a flu
And whats crazy about it too
Is all she sees is lies when she look him in his eyes
And her baby got them too
Pay a little child support but whats so shady about him too
Is in the club he pop Rozay but wont bring baby bottles through
I know things fell part I aint saying we gotta glue
But if you walking around in Prada buy your baby Prada too
Telling hoes yes we cant get a maybe outta you
Shit is fucked up and I dont think the baby gotta clue
Whats a lady gotta do Bend over for dollar tips
Cause aint nobody giving young single mothers scholarships
Mama just got diagnosed breast cancer
So when they ask what shes gonna do her best answer
Is I dont know gotta do what I gotta do
And I dont know about your bills but the ones I got are due
People always wanna try and tell you what you gotta do
But theres a difference in what those who dont and those who got it do
Its called sacrifices hate to see my man gone
Bail was like a pop fly just to bring my man home
Cant just leave him out there
Gotta believe in yourself even when theres doubt there yeah
Jesus died on that cross thats a sacrifice
Niggas dying for their cross thats a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge thats a sacrifice
If shorty took that charge for you thats a sacrifice

1756,"Deuce deuce revolver
Was my problem solver
Had a def girl really didnt
Wanna involve her
In the life of a gangster
Used to rob bankster
But now Im locked up
Im just a punk low rankster
Jail cells
Know me too damn well
Seems like Ive built on earth
My own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed
Somehow I always fell
Guess a lot of players got
This story to tell
No matter how cold you roll
You simply cannot win
Its always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end
Pain x4 
Organized crimer
Big trouble finder
In and out of institutions
Ever since I was a minor
But now Im on the bricks
Deep in the mix
Crimesmart searching hard
For some new street tricks
I think Ill join a gang
Sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt
And get myself a name
Fresh sneakers silk shirts
247 work
Ninetofive to survive
You gotta be a jerk
I clock two grand a day
Yes I was born to play
Who me At Micky Ds
It wouldnt work no way
Im a big money haver
But not the last laugher
For me infamy
Makes me no autographer
Custody haunts my dreams
Nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance
Phobia of cameras
My banks bigger
But so are my fears
Past records prove players
Live limited years
But Im unlike the rest
Known to be the best
Fast money true wealth
My eternal quest
I hustle all night long
There aint no gain in rest
12 gauge close range
Bloods on my chest
I looked into his face
I thought he was my friend
My boy had me set up
This wound would never mend
No matter who you trust
You simply cannot win
Its always fun in the beginning
But its pain in the end
Pain x4 
Gold rope wearer
Neighborhood terror
Cant hang around my mother
Cause she says I scare her
Got a light sunburn
From too much poolside sittin
Cordless phone keeps me on
Cause there aint no quittin
Minds in a money mode
Seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie
Got a female overload
Young street messiah
Professional liar
19 got a Benz
21 Ill retire
Crazy money it aint funny
Suckers lovin my jock
But theres some people at my door
That didnt even knock
Task force boomin
Doggin my crib out
Cant shout
FBIs got a gun in my mouth
Threw me on the floor
Called my girl a whore
Pulled ten Gs out my mattress
And was lookin for more
Cracked my safe with an axe
Then they laughed to the max
When they seem my money kickin it
In twentyG stacks
Booked me on ten counts
With bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue
Some that I couldnt pronounce
They threw my ass the book
My life was surely took
Then they gave my girl ten years
For hangin out with a crook
She played the game herself
Fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law
Or the citys health
The sweat of hustlers greed
Is not reserved for men
Its always fun in the beginning
But its pain in the end
Pain x5 
Yeah that aint nothin
Cause when I get outta here Imma get right back in the money
Cause they dont know that I know what time it is ya see
I done learned something I did half my time but I can learn more when I was in here
And Imma go right back out and get paid you understand what Im sayin Cause I did half my time Word
I only got nine years left
PAIN

Whats the result Justice 
Do I deserve it Ask yourself that question 
What do you have All those who come to this surface 
What are you giving Sudaka 
When will you die Allah knows best 
How are you living Sirat al mustaqim 
Incur calamity to bring about tragedies and casualties
Whats your way of life is it blessed or is it blasphemy
I look around me everybodys living so savagely
Trying to stay sane in this world full of insanity
Repeating our mistakes as we havent learned from our history
Kids disrespecting their parents like  
Billions of dollars are being wasted to drop bombs
On poor Bedouin families because they tamper with Bushs poppyseed
As long as I speak the truth I will always think  enemy

Fulsom prison filled with citizens thats proven innocent
Positive man defeat the rights of the indigenous
Violence the number one form of entertainment
Guide us we need to free us from mental enslavement
Alcohol sex drugs guns
A few tools the devil uses to entice what you love
When the dramatic scenes of a movie make you cry
But no remorse for the garbage that we see throughout our lives
Weve got eyes but can we really see
Or hear what we want to hear
Act like we wanna be
Guard your faculties you cant afford to live haphazardly
Your kids with potential not knowing their capabilities
Justice isnt really given to the society
Your love of anything can lead you blindly
This life is a deception
Full of selection
So people use created objects for protection
When death comes you dont have no choice but to surrender
Surprise attack like they did the World Trade Center

I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records never sold dope
So I aint hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But Im a thinker methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman no child no witness no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but its Gods face in that mirror
We was made in his image dialing and its much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan blonde hair blueeyed like the Fhrer
The judge and the jury the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We aint the same color clarity of diamond nigga
Nah I aint got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart its as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading no writing made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings we at it again
Just hand me the crown Im active again
Everything that it seems hear my passion again
Was never my dream the immaculate win
I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble white walls in my new spot
Four chains big studs a nigga too fly
Top down tank top I think Im 2Pac
So Im labeled the rebel nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings only major league teams
Chasing my paper couldnt fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia should enroll in myself
God body and mind food for the soul
When you feeding on hate you empty my nigga it shows
Follow the codes aint no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you my nigga hold on
If you right or you wrong if you riding come on
By the end of this song cant be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered niggas grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Follow the codes aint no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall I got you my nigga hold on
If you right or you wrong if you riding come on
By the end of this song I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
If you right or you wrong if you riding come on
By the end of this song I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on

Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Ive been thinking bout Ive been thinking bout
Ive been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love feel I need another dose
I know its a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice where did the king go wrong
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls I need your warm
The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so Im a keep dreaming on
Its kind of like The Breakup with Jen and Vince Vaughn
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone

I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
They say you dont know know know what you got
Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such yo a lot but the feelings not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasnt able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess its only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you

2587,"Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
Whats the date and time it dont matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homies Impala
She said whats up yeah whats the deal
Check the hairdo of course it aint real
Then I looked down she was fat in the front
I asked how long Well about seven months
Oh how time flies when youre having fun
She said Yeah but the damage is done
Where you been On a little vacation
Oh by the way congratulations
Whos the lucky man I dont have a clue
Then she said The lucky man is you I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy
She said Yeah remember that date
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said Damn are you sure its mine
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times
She said That day no I wasnt whoring
Your ass is mine thats when the sweat started pouring
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw cause then Id really get faded
Thats murder one cause it was premeditated
So what Ima do I dont have a clue
How many months left damn only two
Im gettin faded
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
No cigar G
Ay yo homey man Im getting faded
Its crazy cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
Cause yo ho I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and Im knowing
That Im a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit shit
Im gettin faded
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
Ay yo you know what time it is
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in Whoa yeah 
Nine months later shes ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
Its supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know Ice Cube cant be having that G
Im thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now Im in the closet looking for the hanger
JD and Jinx and TBone wont let up they wont shut up
Im gettin fed up bitch
Cause I know youre tryin to break me
But if I find out your tryin to fake me
Im a buff that duff and hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my nextdoor neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But lets check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative
Damn why did I let her live
After that I shouldve got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the ho who laid me
Excuse me bitch its a switch
You cant fade me
Naw baby not this way
Yo you aint playing Ice Cube out like no booger
I dont fall for the okeydoke
And before I fall for the okeydoke I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
Ha ha yeah baby you cant fade me
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in Whoa yeah

776,"Its the mystery of iniquity
Said its the misery of Inequity
Said its the history of Inequity
When it all all falls down
Telling you all it all falls down
Children eat your bread
Little children eat your bread
Cause it all all falls down
Telling you all it all falls down
Yo Yall cant handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors witness despised
Crooked lawyers false indictments publicized
Its entertainment the arraignments the subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon blackrobe crookedbalance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that In God We Trust
Crossexamined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator receiving the judges favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
For status gratis apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution political prostitution
The more money you pay the further away solution
Legal actors Babylons benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants morally noncompliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isnt making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing hes being used
To discredit edit headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness the paid authority 
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers dodging duty for years
Hating the process waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct Properly serve and protect
Materially corrupt spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind guilty never defined
Filthy as swine a generation purin its own mind
Legal extortion blown out of proportion
In vein deceit the truth is obsolete
Only two positions victimizer or victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma
Trying to own a piece of the American Corona
The Revolving Door insanity every floor
Skyscraping paper chasing what are we working for
Empty traditions reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief brethren can we candidly speak
Woe to the men trusted in the chariots dem
Leaning on horses they run their intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
Internally they absent of light
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first angelic being cast to the earth
Its time for rebirth burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed let him who stole no longer steal
Oh its real surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh selfinterest Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be retaught
Youll find what you sought
Was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die
Its the mystery of iniquity
Said its the history of Inequity
Said its the misery of Inequity
When it all all falls down yeah
Im telling you all it all falls down

333,"You said youd never ever break down
But here I am sweeping pieces off of the ground
You said youd never ever play to crowds
But Ive seen you hoping to play songs to them now
Ive spent all night long scared of tomorrow I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost pick it up slow before its gone
Were fragile
Wish Id have known 
I never thought Id be so fragile
Youre not alone 
If it didnt break before its about to
Weve been here before 
I dont ever want to change
Im fragile
I dont ever want
I dont ever
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and die
N9na be givin the remedy and why
Critics are really the enemy and I
Cant stand the way they slam todays gifted
Effin incredible get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
Im the N9ne Ima look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times itll be better leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin but lies quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin
Hes a beginner and hopes for your demise folks Ima despise
Never do try to listen
Its real Im mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You dont really get why Im so pissed Understand this
Im an artist and Im sensitive about my shit yes Im

Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know youre heinous
Tell me that you love me always thinkin of me
Unconditional Im hoping Im your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
Thats the feelin I get when youre concentratin
On this pen on this pad
Tell me youre willin to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin of pickin apart this track
Stop
Puttin my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin to bury a deep hole for mine
Drop
This is more than you and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin and abusin
What I call the realest comin from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger then I started shootin
That was nicotine Im bout to smoke em all
And journalists involved shouldve known my music

We got this ho muthafucka on a mission
Now the whole entire worlds gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they calling on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip Spice1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap aint done shit for that
Ive even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you trying kick some dust up
Americas been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuckups
And we were always considered evil
Now they trying to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus Devin The Dude
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
So now they trying separation
And sending black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tapping into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So Davids got a silver mag
While listening to Brad David gets pissed and kills his dad
David Dukes got a shotgun
So why you get upset cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you dont dig me than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be saying aint worse than no western movie
Dont blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus Devin The Dude
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
You best to free your mind
Before I free my nine
And stop fucking with Dvoidofpop
Or feel my hot rocks
Bangbang boom boom ping ping Im the black
White boys got a magazine and dont kow how to act
Ill attack and make you vomit
Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad
Do he got a brother Im it now
Im the illest
Wanna kill this house nigga Don Cornelius
Can you feel this
You punk niggas make me sick
Sucking on the devils dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start douching
Houston is the place
I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut

496,"Chad Butler known as Pimp C died in a Los Angeles hotel room
The LA County Coroners office ruled the rappers death accidental and attributed it to a combination of
Apnea
Yes
And syrup and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine
Absolutely we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic
He rolled up asked him what he was sippin on
He said Lean you wanna hit it dawg
Thats the same stuff Weezys sippin huh
And tons of other rappers that be spittin hard
Yup he had five up on
Then went and passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter Pink heard a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip sittin in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimpin as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hotbox let the bass bump
Take it to the face gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddamn he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat just so healin
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up cold sweat scratchin itchin
Tryna escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldnt get off it
Didnt even think he had a problem
Though he couldnt sleep without gettin nauseous
Room spinnin
Thinkin he might have sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutchin that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name shook him but he never got up
He never got up he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinkin that it wont be us
It wont be us it wont be us it wont be us
Nah it wont be us
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed ash in a tin
Pack being pushed harassed by the feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talkin about some shit they havent lived
Surprise you know the drill
Trapped in a box declinin record sales
Follow the formula violence drugs and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
Theres no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup Percocet and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke depressed and emotionally vacant
Despite how Little Wayne lives
Its not conducive to being creative
And I know cause hes my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that Id try after I listen to Dedication
But hes an alien
Id sip that shit pass out or play PlayStation
Months later Im in the same place
No music made feelin like a failure
And trust me its not dope to be twentyfive
And move back to your parents basement
Ive seen my peoples dreams die
Ive seen what they can be denied
And weeds not a drug thats denial
Groundhog Day life repeat each time
Ive seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them we used to chief dimes
Ive seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheatin and lyin
Friendship cease no peace in the mind
Stealin and takin anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken hopeless headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealers supplyin
That rush that drug that dope
Those pills that crumb that roach
Thinkin I would never do that not that drug
Growing up nobody ever does
Until youre stuck
Lookin in the mirror like I cant believe what I become
Swore I was gonna be someone
And growin up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up keep me up
Hollywood here we come
You can tend to um go a little too far with some of these things they have very strong addictive qualities pills and syrups and whatnot so um
Is it changing the music
Um I can only speak for myself personally you know what Im saying
Um we had been taking down toning down the content of certain things in the music lately
My new album of course probably wont have any references to cough syrup in it
But uh its a little bit more than the music
I think its gonna start affecting the personal lives of a lot of artists and people

Callin to see how that joint know what Im sayin came out
Aiyyo fellas keep a eye open watch out
Cause females be playin a whole lot of games like these
Aiyyo fellas you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some dont play fair
You might get caught out there if you not aware
I know this lady by the name of Katie
If you broke shes shady
You got cash Shes ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death well dressed in Chanel Guess nothin less
Body got more curves than a S I smoked the boots like cess
And I confess the sex was the best Yes 
Within a week she had keys to my rest
I done made her my main squeeze and gave her Gs to invest
Then one day I overheard her talkin to friends
Sayin how she didnt like me all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinkin she was wifey
Trickin ridiculous givin her jewels that was icey
I said Its over and what I gave you you can have that
It wasnt even her it was myself I was mad at
Lettin that dame use me for my name and my fame
Thats lame but its a shame how I fell for the game
A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name she replied Monique
Soft and sweet from her head to feet hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat lets go get somethin to eat
She said I was that RocaFella shed been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night she said she wasnt a freak
Yeah right Its all good so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home and said Tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin shes pregnant with my child I think thats quite foul
How is that I wore a Lifestyle
So watch out fellas watch out
You better watch out fellas
Yeah you better watch out
Watch out fellas you better watch out
For real

Running round killing shit and telling cops I didnt do it Niicee 
Thats why they call me Young OG
And Ima spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chilling in my city but my lungs OT
And fuck them niggas online reply why
Broke niggas talking cause its free WiFi
I hear you you know the problem with you lil niggas
You think you know everything about the damn world and you dont know shit
Well I see you got yourself a lil business goin
Well thats good thats good when you make that paper
But when you makin paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
There are two types of niggas in this world there are niggas with guns and niggas with butter
Now what are guns The guns thats the real estate
Thats stocks and bonds artwork you know shit that appreciates with value
Whats the butter Cars clothes jewelry all that other bullshit that dont mean shit after you buy it
That is what its all about guns and butter baby
Lil dumb motherfuckers

Two pumps ready for a riot
Full Baretta six hostages with a loss of oxygen
Wet as a river sixteen bricks to flip

Hyperactive with a automatic snappin reaction

Kick the door in for sure double fours rammin
Hollow bandit ready to knock him off if he standin
Position the cannons telegraph the whole parameter
Paralyze anything that walks through perimeter
Cervical veins lacerated lost to missiles
Interrogated and I paraded posted with pistols
Time for war this is when the hearts exposed
Change up the game cockin and sparks explode
Im a marksman touch of death ten steps then draw
And thats all end to anything before
In a world war off like a Concorde jet
But fool DPGs the set
In a world war this is when the hearts exposed
Change up the game cock sparks explode
Manicdepressive panic and then start skitzin

She said Ooh baby just take control baby
Long as you take it slow baby then you can hit it all night baby
She gave me the green so I had to go start screaming my name when I went low
And every time I started going real fast she looked at me and said
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light
I told her that I wanted to beat it up fast so lil mama let me know when to go
Tonight she dont want a drill session she wanna feel it so she told me to take it slow
Im so used to mackin it pokin it back to back when Im attackin it I wanna go get in
She blew the whistle like beep be still hold it in now roll it in
She lifted her palms to hold my face because she want me to control my pace
She said she wanna feel it all slide through the windows of the wall cause the feeling was too cold away
Well I can break it down to 50 down to 40 down to 30
In the speed you want me to I can do for you shawty tell me how you want it
Do you want the lambo I give it to you like uh uh uh uh uh when I do it baby
Or do you want the 64 I give it to you like uh uh when I do it baby

Green uh uh too fast red uh uh too slow she want it in the middle so I gotta
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light
Now with a subtle way to soothe your soul got her lovin the way I move the pole instead of rude and bold
I want her to see what it feel like when a playa break it down into cruise control and still rule the role
Never stuck in only one speed dick shift in the stick shift I am not them dudes
Its not a jack rabbit when I be tappin it I wanna slow it up and give it to her chopped and screwed
Come here shawty and let me knock them shoes feel it sensual when I rock to the groove
Make it hot then cool if you think you butter show her how to stutter step stop then move
But I get not the order narray canary and my flow is like a shop of horror
Scaryin berries whenever I rock with the R Kelly in every position for power we slaughter
Im petty like veli Im getting money cause I oughta
I tell the girl to slow down lil mama cause you aint gotta be so anxious
Going rapidly when you flex yo thighs its still good sex if your exercise your patience
We aint gotta do it like we racin cause all the time that aint how I like it
Green uh uh too fast red uh uh too slow Im on the mid level so she gotta
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light

I tried to be a friend motherfucker you under handed me
Lucky this is personal and God got a plan for me
Cause I handle my business never let my business handle me
Sayin your name could do more for you than it can for me
You give niggas and they forget your philanthropy
You aint have a penny to your name Anfernee
Dont ever bite the hand that feed you and then stick out your hand for me
We dont bass we throw niggas in the trunk for real
Chase you out the hood make you live with uncle Phil
Champagne every night I done drunk a mil
Yeah now thats money wasted
But now its kinda hard for me to buy Ace
Specially when I just seen Hov buy Ace
Moves time to make moves
No more jab steps those is fake moves

1185,"I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a 100 the Game spit 3 I said Fuck it
Ima have to show these niggas something
Too easy whod believe me if I said that it wasnt
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didnt think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said Nobody benefits everyone perishes
I tell them this they say Here its time for your medicine
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to 44 4s 22 times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lying
You like red or white wine Lets talk about it Im buying
Lets talk about the Children of Zion excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming Ive mastered it certainly surely
Ill celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it dont coagulate
The sex magik wont work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor more than a rapper
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour then a taser then a laser
Then a maser then a phaser then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why Coup de grce for the coup dtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think Ive had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off I promise you well just talk
No biting allowed just bark dont run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought thought manifests words actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
Im a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself then how would I be
If I do not look tell me how will I see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still cant recognize myself
I dont need anybody but myself
When Im rhyming like this I dont need no help
But thank you for your purchase these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy you wanna be the best you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield ED Fields
Chew MCs like Im eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
Its no use if you cant use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone numbers placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it I dont wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress shes an actress
This is Monster Ball practice Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I dont care if were not the same colour nigga Im your brother
I dont care what you say nigga you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind waves bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing where are you Are you hiding
No I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so Tell the people they need to know
And if you dont think so youre a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say Im crazy I say So tell me something I dont know
Something my psyche profile doesnt show
I dont have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus Answer me
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out No do not go
Where the fuck are you going
400mph wind belts blowing think for a moment
We got to wait it out thats what the trainings about
We have to survive thats what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing
Tough pliable relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I cant rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasnt been made yet
Cause I havent been paid yet not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating I tried to save them they wasnt patient
Responsibility entrusted
Theres only one way for me to prove that I love it thats why Im busting
If you pursue revenge dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that youve made
Musically still producing I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureates my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it concentrate you can hear it
Ive almost perfected this Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you cant forget
Oprah Winfrey dont like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably dont like black
I dont blame her she dont understand its only entertainment
She probably wouldnt feel different if she wasnt famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist if not racist with colour
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon not the sigil this is for real though
I sit down and think when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God even Im stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead thats not fair
Who I talk to Go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
I procured a small piece of the treasure collections from a former era
Dating back to forever the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law I dont govern them
I summon them speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet woodwinds strings
The conductor brings the drums in finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance Hip Hop justice rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered liars are denied water you still alive
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary patrolling the open seas at UBoat speed
Beneath the Tsunami where Im supposed to be
Industrialists civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Cosigned by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding lyrics timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it its going to have a word with me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this theres no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieris Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit whos ready
Ill need a volunteer do I have any
Next year Ill get my SPINGS a master space badge
After that Ill stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devils chamber
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The leaders lies got me reassigned my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
Im a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
Well shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like theres a bus up the street
The Dr and I would meet at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health killing myself
Rebuilding myself nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill getting more ill
The woman who is there she will take care of you
With Nexium Avodart Lipitor and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second One answer per session
Hip Hop made me Hip Hop praise me
Aint nothing changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy battle me baby
1000 Bars nigga after that maybe
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians I do it for the soldiers
Raptors Comanches Strykers Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fighting the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where we gon go
Starving in destitution dying for retribution
Why would you wanna blow a hospital You stupid
Why would you not force yourself to make better music
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot 4 ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor I see excitement coming
I raise my hand lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say were divided I say were small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
783 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
1000 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary but tell me whos the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when Im touring
Acupuncture point or plus is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute or debate
My face is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing from the other side it looks like its opening
Where am I trying to go with this
Fire and Ash fallout thats what its all about
We must construct a shelter and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
It wont happen til AFTER the official autopsy
A good psychological environment for science

As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But Im unprepared to take action just like you

Spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die Now its dont vote Why
Weed is now legalized are you high
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
Be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
But not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr Iconoclast
If you dont leave the bottle outside you cant pass
Gather the evidence then give it to the President
Dont reprimand him ask him for help next 190
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I cant wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web everyday we are burying dead
Every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
Youll never reach the end of it 200
Fire and forget rhyme for respect
I didnt get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause Im familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said let it be written let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity

This never been done before in history
I spit at a thousand KIPS kilo tons of pressure

A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull

Deja Vu in the booth is the truth when you apply it
Devine design a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I cocreate rap 30
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets I attack it
Access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
Finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
They cant battle me so theyd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy

Emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions Reality
Thats how it has to be
In front of me on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me 60
Sitting down at the mixing boardroundbanquet table comfortably
They begin to study me by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely I rose I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship pulling me with planet like inertias
Words blinking like the text edit cursor

1934,"Yeah Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder
Like those motherfuckers runnin away from the Twin Towers
Gunshots rock the Earth like a meteor shower
Bowlin For Columbine fear givin the media power
Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box
Government cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock
Corrupt cops false testimony at your arraignment
Check to check constant struggle to make the payments
Workin your whole life wonderin where the day went
The subway stays packed like a multicultural slave ship
Its rush hour 230 to 8 non stoppin
And people comin home after corporate sharecroppin
And fuck flossin Mothers are tryin to feed children
But gentrification is kickin them out of their buildin
A generation of babies born without healthcare
Families homeless thrown the fuck off the welfare
Homicide Harlemblaow Whats the problem
Homicide Harlemblaow Whats the problem

Homicide Harlemblaow Whats the problem
Its like Cambodia The Killing Fields uptown
We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
The sound of conservative politicians on television
People in the hood are blind so they tell us to listen
They vote for us to go to war instantly
But none of their kids serve in the infantry
The odds are stacked against us like a casino
Think about it most of the Army is black and Latino
And if you cant acknowledge the reality of my words
You just another stupid motherfucker out on the curb
Tryin to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
But you cant read history at an illiterate stage
And you cant raise a family on minimum wage
Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage
I give niggas the truth cause their pride is indigent
You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
But Im sick of feelin impotent watchin the world burn
In the era of apocalypse waitin my turn
Im a Harlem nigga thats concerned with the future
And if youre in my way itd be an honor to shoot ya
Uproot ya with the evil that grows in my people
Makin them deceitful cannibalistic and lethal
But I see through the mentality implanted in us
And I educate my fam about who we should trust

Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok
If you do it my way my way my way 
Hush baby 
You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood
Mildmannered or up to nogood
It really doesnt matter either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop Spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But theres faith in our mind
Were spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast the whole worlds in a rush
Everybody just hush

The villa in the Bahamas
The highs the lows
The Hooptie the Rolls
The money flowin
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortons or Sizzler steak
But everything will be okay
If we do it my way my way my way
Cuz I believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl Ill swim to France
Cuz ya beautys unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love forever we are attached
Deal with the drama we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach

Walkin thru the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothings gonna change

Come on yall and feel the groove
Get on down and make your move
Welcome to the funkiest
Brooklyn style laid out like this
Chorus
I kicks the flavor good to represent the neighborhood
Where I come from and thats the place of Brooklyn
Where the grimies are born and bred
And bullets are like eyeballs two to the head
Well is it Brownsville Time to represent for the map
Where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps
The party addict about to explode
From the 112 the double3 ill zip code
Parlayin on the corner drinkin 40s shootin ceelo
Its a Brooklyn thing aight You know our steelo
And for those who just dont know how it go
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know
So yo who wanna set it You better kick your best G
You and your whole entourage couldnt test me
I represent for the fo main
And if youre not a booty bandit then niggas cant hang
Chorus
Now lets get straight down to the point
I represent for this Brooklyn joint baby pah where were takin it to
Makin a few dollars dont mean you gotta forget
Where you come from and try to be someone that youre really not
And front with what you got
Youre gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real
What type of mission can I say you on
Because you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon heh
Im really happy to see you blew up
But always remember my man you grew up
In the PJs all your life in a broken home
Scoob Well alright now 
Up in the PJs all your life keepin it strong WHAT
I be the Louis Ave livin live long lastin lover
Bonafied black brother word to the mother
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made
The man with support and always stayed a fan
My dialectic style is perfected
In ways you cant imagine rap bein accepted
Funkll slam like a doper jam pops
Im takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam
So check out the asiatic type of flow
Like water in the Nile but its Brooklyn style
Chorus
Yo this is Big Scoob no practice
Im flippin on niggas like little kids on that mattress
You know my style Baby Pah from the PJs
My lyrics so dope they too fat for local DJs
So hear me out no doubt no need for screamin
My boys in the back clockin your jewels and they scheamin
Why did they step to me I hit em bow budow
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile
No need for beef chief Im rollin mad deep
So pick up your teeth I got him shakin like a leaf
Not tryin to scare you I just wanna aware you
I bet you wont even look at my face WHAT WHAT WHAT I dare you
Yo nigga please yo Im nice with these
While youre guardin your grill Ill be beatin up your kidneys
Me and my boys with the fat tec 9s
With my joint cocked back in case a punk tried to take mines
Where Im from theres no need for hesitation
We cock and squeeze now wheres the doctor for this patient
Hes drippin blood and now hes down to his last breath
But he wont make it cause he knows that my joint is def
The ill type of Brooklyn artist
Who rocks the hardest regardless
Who you know and where youre from I pull your file
How Brooklyn style

2861,"What do you see when youre in the dark and the demons come
I see you I see you standing over the grave of another dead President
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fighting over heaven heaven heaven
Its real
Americas nightmare young black and just dont give a fuck
Run up in the courtroom and wet em up
Got nothin to lose but my handcuffs
Every man must choose to lay down or stand up
Its war time everything is fair no fear
When they say the homie murdered the judge I dont care
Fuck em he deserved it long as the homie get away
And dont get caught for the crime I encourage it
We rootin for the villain in black
Pourin out Absolut salute niggas is shootin back
In selfdefense we bang the pistol like
Larry Davis or Brian Nichols
Every pig every public official the boomerang
Is coming back to get you you reap what you sow did you
The system you created created a monster
And now you scared cause its coming back to haunt you
Since we gonna take the blame Imma rep my name to get my aim right
Lets have an overthrow and after party in the same night
Same height as Huey same muscle build as Malcolm
With the same circumstances in the hood you know the outcome
And read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain
Dont take this as a warning just another nigga rappin
Fuck the way we organizing fuck the training and the grapplin
And fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smack them
And fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions
Cause we bangin on the system Gd up fuck the factions
And if you didnt know the G was for George Jackson
And long live his warrior spirit packin the Magnum
Watching over the soldiers knowin niggas be blackin
When we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions
When we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin
Till then inside the blood of my eye you see the dragon
Im like the birth of baby Mohammed the movement I started
Can spar with the hardest the martyr regarded as Spartacushearted
It doesnt matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest
When youre a target in an Afghan Teutoburg Forest
Close quarters combat over corrupted elections
Bilderberg is like cancer it grows an infection
Nepotism is the gold and the conductors connection
And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
The military aint there for the peoples protection
Theyre just there to protect an investment
Thats why people get arrested electrocuted molested
Connected streets are infested with those tired of protestin
Traumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons
911 generations pale in comparison
And you will learn a lesson repeated through history
That no matter what you think occupation is not victory
Somalia Kashmir
Nigeria Palestine
Iraq bring it back

Free as a bird spoken word in my verse
On my knees prayin niggas shootin in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard where the fuck to go next
Go against the odds youngin go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but Im close to my kids
Thug cry for Mac Dre nigga throwin up Thizz

Richer than a bitch but still I cant afford to

My head stay in the clouds I really feel like a giant
Cant trust none of these niggas I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas still got dirt under my fingers

118,"Huh
What are you crazy You know who I am
Moe Dee Yes Im the man
I am the flyest cleanest baddest meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
Ill take you where I wanna go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if theres someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross theyll say Dont you know
Really really really dont you know
Cause Im a real rap warrior Elite Astoria
Ill take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And Ill prove that theyre all ducks
Cause I dont care nothin bout your money and gold
Dont wanna hear about how many records you sold
Cause none of that dont mean nothin to me
Cause Im the greatest but not Ali
Im Kool Moe Dee
What are you senile Have you lost your mind
Im the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rappers hall of fame bein that its all a game
I might not be down because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin thats why Im tellin
You when I go homeboy Im gone
Cause Im better but dont get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And were all enemies on the court
But when the game is over Ill shake your hand
Give ya a pound cause youre still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy its a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause Im an intellect ya
Bird brain rappers I call hiphappers
Not hiphoppers cause yall just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But Im perfect I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause Im the greatest but not Ali
Im Kool Moe Dee
Dont piss me I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off Dont diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers beam em up take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by megamillions you witness a birth
Of a new society rappers with variety
So much prestige flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
Its hard to believe but think about it it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
Theres no race no contest Ill never have to jostle
Theyre small time to them I am collossal
Im a gladiator with the image of a god
Im powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm recite em as a poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement lo and behold
The Ice Man cometh Kool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god apex of the hiphop cult
Im the leader rhyme breeder yes I am the ult
imate idolized figure theres not a name bigger
Than Kool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and thats cause I
Really feel that Im the best so I personify
Rap to the fullest I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I dont stop rockin under no condition
I rock nonstop but dont ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if its your brain the answers of course cause Im a
Autohypnotic reversepsychotic
Thatll make you feel if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
Im the greatest but not Ali
Im Kool Moe Dee
Im Kool Moe Dee
Im Kool Moe Dee

While the ladies all beggin me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now its all happy endings on my lap in Japan hey

Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago

Look like he been swimmin in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga Put your hands down
If you smell like you been at work all day and Drakkar
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say Put your hands down
If your spinnin rims spin counter clockwise you are not pimpin
If you are dancin on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what You guessed it you are not pimpin
If your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
Thats because you didnt order Vodka buddy
Thats why its three dollars a glass aput your hands down

1139,"And yes yall the sounds that you hear is gonna be so real
Youll have no fear cause three live brothers are here
We got KRSOne from Boogie Down Productionsn special shout to Melodie
We got my man Chuck D in the house from Public Enemy
And I am Kool Moe Dee
So are you ready
Are you ready to elevate
As I rhyme on time youll illuminate
Hard as diamond knowledge shinin
Its that time and its all in the timin
Four hundred years blood sweat and tears
The rain is over and the sun is here
Yeah bright and clear countdown to the year
No fear cause Im in there
Holding my mic like the staff of Ra
Bringing true light after dark
Brothers are live but still unborn
Its almost morn and its time to mourn
See the light like a crack of dawn
The comatose and the cracked are reborn
Regurgitating the garbage were fed
Cause this time dawn is dawn of the dead
Aint that funky Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky Yeah thats funky 
Rise and shine
Aint that funky Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky Yeah thats funky 
Get up
I rise and shine like the sun on the one
We dance together we overcome
A wakeup call to wake up all
Stand up tall get up and get up yall
Clap your hands in jubilation meditation
Recreation procreation of the mind
If you seek well find
Born two times but still one of a kind
Learn your past find your path
The truth is infinite like math
Countdown to the year two thousand
The thought alone is arousin
When we sing Ill wake with the third eye
Rise with the sun and think with a birdseye
View as I watch our exodus
When the higher conscience connects its just
The microphone is my funk receptor
When I speak on beat Im trying to connect us
To whats left us messed up
Egos dressed up got us effed up
You see onto instead of into
You see what you want to instead of what you been through
You can take the rhyme I say
Read it hear them see them three ways
Combine the rhyme to any one of nine
For some still the light wont shine
You can take a shot in the dark but keep missin
You aim with one eye you just dont listen
Cause see in the dark you need all three
Your eyes are ears when you hear what you see
The five senses are all correlated
The sixth and seventh is how you elevate it
Ringdingdingdingdingdingding
This a KRS with a different something
What come in a dance and we come down for sing
This a KRS me say go
Nuff slaveships come from Africa
Full of Africans sold in America
Now you want me to call myself American
Even though America kill the African
Check it white man is European
And black man is African
White man never say EuroAmerican
So why should the black man say AfroAmerican
If the black man is American with a afro
Then the white man is American with a long nose
It should be LongNoseAmerican for the white man and
Jump around and move your bottom what
Make no mistake we dont shake or stutter
So heed the word of the brothers
Who makes a boy into a man
Its the job of another man
Who knows his role as a father
He bothers to give his son his soul
And pass it on to never flunk
Cause papa dont raise no punks
Got to make it known and to pass it down
Yeah sounds like a job for the brother man now
Got to help a mother for me uh
Each one teach one if you cant find one
Talk to the little ones
And youll see theyll listen
To fill the missin
Peace to rise and shine

1094,"Yeah Kool Keith should keep it real
He should ent rap about space and Mars
Yo Im tired of looking at everybody Same boots skully hats in
90 degree weather looking to get into clubs for free Im not
Smoking blunts or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt
I left New York the city itself was stress depression
High boots and urban beats that wasnt my direction
Producers filtering join in with RB
A million rappers some clones trying to sound like me
Biting my space styles biting my horrorcore
All I saw was little Kool Keiths on my tour
Record companies I Gdoff all my royalties
Watching vinyl spin local groups wack MCs
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap
Karl Kani jeans fat stomachs in the limosines
Mixtapes by wack DJs as doo doo play
Im on the turnpike the city drifting down the highway
Like a mirage the style there is all illusion
On videos out of town peoples spot confusion
Rolling high with caps pulled over down my eye
Since I been out yall cant see
Chorus x2
Is the world made of plastic
Is the city buried in dreams Yeah 
Is the world made of plastic
Cause thats the way is seems Owww 
Watching TV so bored while imbiciles hold the mic cord
Graffiti playgrounds are played out yo howd that sound
Army fatigues are weak is for the minor leagues
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz
Crews on stage acting hard with a thousand friends
I saw the place turn plastic crack heads looping beats
People with no deals walkmens rappin on the streets
I turned my back 90 of the city sounded wack
Payola scams switch DJs like a rubber band
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier
Clearing your samples your SP12 fake examples
My money grosses with green from my own label
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label
Your tristate ways are shut down by barricades
In fact I pack my bags and listened to E40
Mac Mall CBo and other rappers you dont know
Youre narrowminded in styles of mine you wont find it
My sound proceeds with Moog and undertone bass
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face
I come back real solid rock razor steel
Tappin your program show the world Im the man
You copy Poppa Large the industry is robbed
Chorus x2
As I do see soda wack rugged beer commercials
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles
From Manhattan I heat up yo light up Times Square
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare
No promotional shows girls wear corn rows
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes
I walk with straw hats and glasses in the projects
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage
Playing my numbers waiting for the Five to come
Spaghetti out the window people acting dumb
Fire hydrants wet the neighbors your familys nosy
I come and go as I please on blockhead MCs
You bought sneakers no car scrambling on the corner
Im not the star you are the citys fallen far
My mechanism youre on my tip
Stay off my penis youve duplicated me for years
Yeah yeah yeah you are the one
Chorus x

Cause if we wont then who will True 
Terror Squad style yo
Speak on it God 
Yo I was a wild adolescent blessed with the foul essence
Messin around with the wrong crowd I learned my lesson
Stressin all the things that I have not
I pray to God I get my Uncle out the crack spot
I hear mad shots homicide come and play Matlock
But never crack the case cause the defendants a bad cop
You feel me fam The devils got a plan
Thats why Farrakhan formed the Million Man up in Washington
The Hidden Hand even planned this man
Have me goin hand to hand killin my own clan
But now I understand and see the big picture
Fuck cryin about the struggle I teach you how to get richer
Shit is a hassle in this rotten apple kids robbin coppin capsules
Rockin tattoos boppin with ankles locked in shackles
Got the cops joggin at you spittin rounds of clips they down wit it
New clownsll make you feel as if the Bill of Rights is counterfeit
Now its been written that all men are equal but then its legal
When they beat us and treat us as if were different people
We go for delf fuck the cops health
Id rather drop shelf and let off shots until my Glock melts
Cause God dealt us a helpless hand they made us sell this land
So the palest man could build a selfish plan
You know we cant trust the government cause Uncle Sam is smugglin
Drugs for us to hustle all the stuff for him
Even McGruff is in it gettin a percentage
Takin advantage punishin just blacks and hispanics
My heart is cold as ice so I know Im sheist Big Pun was the kid
That no one liked my whole life is one big roll of the dice
Payin a price twice as expensive as white kids
Destined for Rikers not knowin my existence was priceless
Its like this my soul was lifeless I earned stripes
Fightin the nicest in the crisis I slice em in half and make em dash
Like hyphens invitin any rapper to Clash With the Titan
The writings like fighting cause rappers be biting like Tyson
Im hypin the crowd keepin em Loud like my label
Im proud Im able to lift from the bowels of the ghetto
I found me a little sanity inside a career and a family
No more wars and renderin tears to insanity
So keep the salary and tear the mic cause I love it
Theres my life you judge it fuck it Seis I dont want it
Im a Dominican stranded in New York like Gilligan
Dont wanna get locked up in the pen again
But here they come the badges and cuffs searchin for guns
Turnin they ride on the side of the curb to see who runs
They authorize the beast to walk the streets holdin heat
Four deep we puff production my cheek you know my steez
Fuck the police usin probable cause to break laws
Behind the badge you try to cover up your racial war
I got somethin for you boys in blue
The system poisoned you blew your cover now what you supposed to do
I never let the faggot pull the trig first
It wont be no American flag over my hearse
Whats worse you know they disperse for bucks
So take caution in the streets cause our protection sucks
This dude he had the darkest pads
Who dressed up in the heart of brash
Forever talkin trash
How he stacked niggas to almanac
Gunshots to corner four police informants
Stood like he modeled the latest fashions sidewalk sideshow performance
He raised to pull a graceful razor blew his face
Four is commissary plus a pack of dadundaduns laced with toothpaste
Life aint to be gambled son you could get trampled
By people that act more like animals than mammals high off enamel
Thats what his poppa said whose locked for droppin Ahmed
In the candy store robbery probably to get his veins fed
He aint listen he became a braindead cocaine head
Older Mexicans knew they killed him eatin bacalaitos
But hey little kids dont follow these dopes
What Uhhuh yea I can dig that
They call me Prospect I just came back from New Paltz
Had this track on pause now Im back on course
Its lost on the Ave tryin to take my life from the past
Get this legal cash look what I done grabbed without dad
Kinda sad how he got dragged down to negativity
Only if he had one love trust for liberty
This world would be a better place get what it takes
In a race to racism replace the snake in em
Bad ones want to spend lives and discriminate
Im tryin to keep this positive vibe and from that
I generate to the top like Puffy wont stop
Im mature now with one knot from tryin to get locked
And to the shorties on the block tryin to twist 40 tops
Get your act together do some carpentry with a Black n Decker
And stop speedin like a Kawasaki
From my life to your life Im touchin everybody Twinz watch me
Everything we speak is the truth
From Prospect to Munroe here in a hot second
The whole world run know everything we speak is the truth

2445,"What Your Life LikeÂ 2 Lyrics
Cmon lets try this Guru
When I was five years old I realized it was a road
But at the end I aint seen lots of pots of gold
I seen a long cell block the box the hole
Six hundred fenced in some innocent some rotten souls
Some men with men stop it whoa
I aint runnin up in shit but a broad or a bank
Tryin to cop a small hammer move out like Shawshank
With Redemptions I got my mind on revenges
They tryin to kill me at the same time keep me alive
Im movin out like Adebisi on Oz
With my skully on tilt two whacks in my palm
Posted up in the yard everyday I think of pokin the guard
Throw a crack a nigga turnin me in
Tryin to crack a nigga turnin me thin
Food soakin in lard news fools get opened in cards
For deputy drapes in this prison life what you livin like
Can you tell me what you live like
Can you tell me what that bed like whats that cell like
Whats livin in hell like Tell me do you eat right
Do you even sleep right
Yo tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights tell me what that life like
Gettin no kites like no flicks like
Make you wanna quit life
Them four letters is a motherfucker
Thats forever like a motherfucker
Without a letter from a motherfucker
It aint even bout the cheddar from a motherfucker
Write a kite some flicks from a motherfucker
Some drawers some socks some kicks from a motherfucker
I cant believe Im doin this bid for you motherfuckers
Im down for another joker case
I was dealt this hand and Ima play it with my poker face
On the block ready to POKE a face
I got an L goin around with a smokin case
You steal the deodorant out of CVS you locked for retail theft
I got it body half a block stolen DT vest
My rap sheet read three deep breaths
Dangerous duct tape daughters
I take to the street like a duck take to water
Get your duck game in order
My bust game in order I fluff caine with water
Can you tell me what you live like
Can you tell me what that bed like whats that cell like
Whats livin in hell like Tell me do you eat right
Do you even sleep right
Yo tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights tell me what that life like
Gettin no kites like no flicks like
Make you wanna quit life
Thats fucked up you bout to take your longest trip
And cant do shit but suck it up be strong and shit
Handcuffed ankle to wrist in back of the bus
Flashbacks of you back in the world
Cant fuck now you thinkin bout who in back of your girl
Got her ass up kill this bitch playin your crib
Thinkin bout who raisin your kids
Shit was all good a week ago fore they came and raided your crib
630 in the mornin they kick your door in
Feds pour in snatch you out your bed while you snorin
You unaware of whats goin on and
Come to find out clients you had for years turned informant
Told the law about the drops you make
How your clientele first started to escalate
Givin him keys to your crib was your next mistake
At that dinner table breakin out that extra plate
You cant turn a career addict off his coke habit
Put him on post with the toast that promote static
Back to the operation they got you locked at the station
Fuck your back time you worryin about what you facin
Heart racin situation gettin scary
Old clients are showin up at the preliminary
DA tryin to bury a nigga to Neveruary 31st
Goddamn that gotta hurt

Attention all you niggas all you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal
Time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker
Turn me up some
Yo
Oh shit who those motherfuckers coming in here
No it cant be Yo 
Yo give me some room Im throwing elbows
Timberland boots Air Force and shelltoes who the fuck is them
If I gotta pay to get in the club
Ima go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I aint on the guest list I aint VIP
I snuck in the exit learned to DIP
My dress code is all black when Im making the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I cant help it if the club only packin a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down at three
And you ballin ass niggas whos dressed to kill
For the hoes showing the toes with extra heels Man 
I gotta get in I drove here
With a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch
Yo Red whats up man
Ayy they aint trying to let you in the club
Yo DJ Kool to the rescue

Blazing like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Dont sleep stay wide awoke
You dialed doc not dialajoke
Crawl or youll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe beat it when the dark is out
Im outside of the line and Im acting a fool
Like a three oclock bully waiting after school Punks 
Ive been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in
Jump move crash smoke drink
Shake that ass thang the fuck you think
Papa Bear at the table and the porridge is pouring
Since Def is the label I belong in a morgue
Im walking half dead acting senile
With bigger niggas from jail than the one on Green Mile
Ill huff and puff blow the club down
Ill snuff a duck Im headed uptown
Yeah thats right we up in this joint now
Ayo we getting ready to take over
Freddie you grab the mic Ima grab the turntables

New Joe Budden
One and two was for yall
This ones for me
Check this talk to em 
I finally found a passion I lacked before
Cant believe I didnt catch ya under the act before
I mean I voiced my complaints that went ignored
A few things you felt that you was too attractive for
Cause eerything out your mouth said that you aint wanna hurt
Love the lifestyle we lived but you aint wanna work
So Id sit you down and say its getting outta hand
While you shoot down eery idea busy worried about a brand
When ya baby dad said all that shit that was trife
How you was married requesting dick pics from Lyfe
Though it all seemed shady maybe I was crazy
I ignored my gut feelin nah not my baby
Accusing me but pretending yourself
I couldnt catch it too busy defending myself
Or was I wrong not seeing a life without you
Or taking eerything that you said at face value
You packed up and left dude I was so glad
Shouldve questioned how you easily became a nomad
If I could do it all again it wouldntve happened so fast
And it burns with every line jotted in this notepad
Cause at first you resembled my twin
Fast forward you gave me identical twins
But then you lost it honestly that murked my soul
Cause though we wadnt tryna have one we got off the birth control
And we was right back at it fucking like addicts
While you was disrupting what was seeming like a marriage
You never got embarrassed interrogating me but that was just Yaris
Yeah we beef and I dragged you off the bed
I swear to this day I reenact it in my head
So I hemmed you up wasnt what I aimed to do
I aint attack you bitch I was restraining you
But you was wifey though I understand that its not a game
Can you imagine my surprise when the cops came
Handcuffed me you pressed charges
But I made bail its just heartless
You cant smash my laptop on the wall
And then think I wasnt gonna react scratch that
I mean you cant call my mom like can I crash at your spot whattup
When Im her son and you just locked me up
But wait this is when it really gets deep
Judge says she get control of the house for a week
Filed a restraining order so she couldnt come near me
The fuck else I do but go right back to Tahiry
Im sleeping on her couch not discussing shit
Staring at the fattest ass not fuckin it
I guess despite everything that she showed me
It felt good to be around a broad that really knows me
I missed all our arguin and yappin
Percocets and muscle relaxers in a napkin
Cant believe that it happened why 
I lost my unborn daughter when we fought
Im thinking I killed Aspen
And thats when I thought that wed be dead awhile
But we decided to reconcile
So hungover from love and what not
How could you not expect us to take another shot
But during all this time we dont live together
Stupid me thought youd go get your shit together
You know get a job or if actings your career
Seems youve pursued the shit for a year from right here
And it appears along with all the yelling and the screaming
We both at the table but my side is leaning
But rather than end it we tried to mend it
Fuck bein a couple lets work on a friendship
But then it got weird I was stunned from that
You took it to a place where there was no coming back
Off my last break up I was able to stomach that
Two weeks removed and you fuckin with a running back
Life is in shambles disguised as a damsel
Lies are a handful
Bouncing off of different guys lookin scrambled
Despised how it was handled
But when you aint got a dime why not decide to gamble
Said youd be in LA doing business
Im thinking thats great I cant fault her
Said youd be with Jennifer the whole time
But you probly didnt think that I would call her
She said she aint seen you since you landed
And for days she been blowing up your phone like a stalker
And all I could do is laugh at myself
As I thought why is old girl sucking off Derrick Ward for
Said we was makin it right but you couldnt
Was on the phone I said Skype but you wouldnt
The puzzle starts coming together and its brutal
Wont Skype Gmail chat wont Oovoo
The whole time Im noticing you actin unusual
And I cant figure out who the fuck you being true to nah 
Said the WiFi was down in the tele
But you aint say you was at hotel his house
Lookin like a groupie
Or maybe I misunderstood when you said yall two was makin a movie
Looking at the shit pile I stepped in again
And to top it off your hoe ass is pregnant again Not again
I been through the world so I suck it up
Its less about the lie more about the coverup
So you busted but you addin to the friction
Cause you deny it all but you do it with conviction
So you talkin to me real disparaging
So what attitude coming off arrogant
If I wanted a trophy wife then you could be
But all it look like is that you renting out pussy
Less about you nah you aint the one
You grown you got choices Im worried bout your son
Thats what got me up being an insomniac
Little nigga cant control how his mommy act
As for me Im tryin flush you out my system
So I counter by filming all my sexual encounters
Mentally not there while Im screwing
And I only keep going cause thats what your doing
Im tryna see hows it done hows it possible
Enough to put a weak nigga in a hospital
Starin at one ex talking about another
But this one would kill if it meant I wouldnt suffer
But she taking little shots Im getting ridiculed
Cause all she complained about I went and did with you
Said she knew it wouldnt last when I lived with you
Shes not your type she aint got the right hips for you
So you try and take somein for pain it dont work
You still feel it all the Novocaine dont work
Nope so we good I dont let it get me down
Not a pussy that good nor a titty that round
For anything to work yall trust is a must
And I learned gotta let a mutt be with a mutt
So I dead that bitch and though the shits been over
Some situations dont end without closure
",to take another shot But during all this time we dont live together Stupid me thought youd go get your shit together You know get a job or if actings your career Seems youve pursued the shit for a

few things you felt that you was too attractive for Cause eerything out your mouth said that you aint wanna hurt Love the lifestyle we lived but you aint wanna work So Id sit you down and say its

Ahh ohh What the fuck

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dawg and I cant see

And niggas tryin to take my life away Cmon

Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause Ill come and take your life away
Many men

Now man these pussy niggas puttin money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker I aint dead
Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme somethin special happened every time
Im the greatest somethin like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over

Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin life behind bars
I dont say Only God can judge me cause I see things clear
Crookedass crackers will give my blackass a hundred years

Every night I talk to God but he dont say nothin back
I know he protectin me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pullin TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I aint gon spell it out for you mufuckas all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the Bible it says what goes around comes around
Hommo shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fuckin breathin
Many men
Many many many many men

Lord I dont cry no more

Have mercy on me

Somewhere my heart turned cold

1451,"These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
I met this girl her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann I shook her hand
We ended up freakin by a garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
Theres another girl her name is Mary
Talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard she was freakin from my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girls a beast
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece
Shell only start talking about signing a lease
I met this tender her name was Lori
An Xrated movie wouldnt tell her story
She had a twin sister her name was Lisa
And just like Lori shes a real dick pleaser
My girlfriends name was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than a tail on a whale
When I freaked Michelle I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames in hell
I Gd this girl her name is Tammy
I didnt wanna do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend her name was Jane
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespan
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender her names Janine
She was 32 and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak shes just a fiend
It really didnt matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big freak fat and sloppy
I kick on back and I watch her mop me
Two tons of fun big Mamma Jamma
A countrygirl from Alabama
I met this freak her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell I was drippin sweat
But I was all up in her trying to hold my breath
Bake and shake us I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Dinah
She was a built little freak from China
I said I dont pimp or gigolo
Im having so much money I dont need a hoe
You can break yourself but you cant break me
You never met a player like hort baby
I knew a dick sucker named BettyJo
Took her to my house and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and Ill tell you more
She was down on her knees begging to blow
Shes like another freak named Rene
You get her alone and shell make your day
Like Burger King she knows the play
But a freak like Rene you can have it your way
These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
I met this girl thick as hell
Only sixteen said her name was Linell
I took her to my house I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than a Century Safe
Let me tell you this since were talking young
I met another girl said her name was Yvonne
Always talking about having fun
Once again at the pad I had it going on
Im Sir Too hort couldnt be no punk
Im trying to get funky like Female Funk
So when you see me coming or see me going
I keep my money let the hoes keep hoeing
I once met a hooker she did it for free
On the Foothill bus number fortythree
All the way in the back she was working me
Had my big beatbox and I was jamming the beat
I met this freak named Antoinette
Macked on baby like an ice cold vet
Everything she had is what I get
Cause Im Too hort baby I dont play that shit
I met another freak her name was Rita
Baby thought Too hort just might eat her
I told her like this she could suck my peter
Or either go home cause I knew I didnt need her
Scratched her name out my telephone book
Never again took a second look
Cause the next young freak her name was Sharon
She kept looking while I kept staring
Baby came through with my homeboy Darren
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearing
She never left he cut out
I know you all know what Im talking about
Theres a freak named Shannon such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and shes getting thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and its going on
She had another buddy came by my place
Thick ass bitch said her name was Grace
She walked in the door working lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
Shes like this tender named Belinda
The homeboys called her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl looked like Olive Oyl
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad her blood would boil
But I wrapped her all up like aluminum foil
These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
Sugar Delight
Friday night
Its going on
Too hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Marys sheep
I hid around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita
Her mans in Santa Rita
I took her to my house and homeboy I Gd her
Sent her on her way
The very next day Playboy hort was ready to play
I bumped into this girl her names Roshawn
We hit the motel and had it going on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Shari
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan she loved my beat
But I wouldnt raise my leg and let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top she was up under
The bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with a girl named Kitty
She was so fine with her big fat titties
All night long she was acting shitty
So I macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
Theres another girl her name is Rose
I use to ride baby like brand new Vogues
I never saw Rose wearing clothes
Shes a Penthouse pet ready to pose
I was riding down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere I just cant stand it
Tried to palm it but I could not manage
I had this freak her name was Bunny
Said Im the only man who ever called her honey
Everything I did to her was funny
I macked on Bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirley
She was real short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirley was freaking like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed then I got on
I grabbed the microphone and started singing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this they might be freaking
But boy you never had that TPTreatment

1317,"Go ahead and wager that you never listen to another song of mine
I cant say I blame you either
Cause if you made records you aint gonna catch me listening to that shit
But if you do I just want you to know I didnt make this to hurt you
God knows you done hurt enough
Just I dont know try to make some real shit you know
Bye you aint never gonna see me again
If I can help it little fellow take it easy
Fresh out of forced tears kisses and hugs
You about to lose the company your misery loves
Aint never did nothing but try to kill your disease
At least help the symptoms instead you infected me
Im not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you gotta draw at all then its time for you to scram
PS you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
The struggling I did with you was all for nothin
It was never enough your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginnin
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didnt think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my mama
Since you never listen to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head
I dont love you I dont think I ever did
And if you hadnt tried to kill me Id stayed for the kid
X 2
Theres nothinmore for us to say
Got my mind made up Im walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to you story someday
Round and round and round we used to go
I never fucked you right or made enough bread I know
If Im such a bastard and mistreated you so
Then how is it youre losing your mind to see me go
Truth be told I held you together
For all them years and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor took in your mama
When she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama
You got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is suppose to live
Sick twisted and vindictive with your windows dim
Baby youre not wicked hard bull fish you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that youll ever be blessed with
Unless youre twisted demented and depressed and shit
And alone cause you faithfully slayed your friendships

Stools on the mattress bruised and battered
Blown out your shoes and your fabrics
With Jakes searchin for clues and maggots

Do you feel that the Blacks in your community
Are still mad at the racial situation
Yeah they still mad
And if you dont take that funny smirk off your face
Ima kick your
Over 300 ghettorelated crimes happened in Newark New Jersey alone
Still the saga continues
Stick em up stick em up I got the jammy to your guts punk
Dont make a move before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block cause my stomachs in a knot
And it growls twentyfour hours a day around the ticktock
I got roaches and rats up the back
Carryin bats and gats so I fart fore I snack Jack
Then guzzle it down with water from the hydrant
My moms taking a bath and my brothers next to dive in
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I havent had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squad up cause Ima set up this kid
Carryin loot out from Burger King and what Ima do is
Run up on him snatch the bag of money
Then bust the dummy
Cause my man when I think of a plan theres no shorts take
Cause I pack jammies inside of my North Face
Coat had the Black brother on scope
No jokes what I am cause the mans a pure pro
Yo my man you got a light Straight jackin 
Yeah yeah give me the effin money too G Yo stop stop stop 
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
Cause I was set up now I have to go head up
With the cops but they carryin black Glocks Shits thick 
Whats my next move My lifes on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on once again its on
I fell Ow and then the black Glocks went Pow 
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing Im sniffin is dust because its
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough

In the 4Runner blastin my tape puffin ganja
Since Erick got props
I stepped to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that babycakes was hawkin me
So I kicked it upped the digits terrific
Not knowin she was scopin me cause I was mad splifted
Later on that week honeydip freaked the funk
Playin Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin him weekdays callin me weeknights
Who had her weekends Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
No hats Damn Black The Funkadelic
Took a splash you know how that go fellas
Two months later See you later alligator 
She was pissed and I ended up seein my physician
She took a blood test she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin Why the hell he isnt dead yet
Then I asked her Why you lookin at me
She said Redman because you have the HIV
Called Erick and his set that girl dont mess around
Too late cause Erick already had his drawers down cause its
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
To all my brothers wear your hats wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters make em wear they prophyllastic
Cause its drastic havin another ghetto bastard
Think Im dying for a piece of butt Honey you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss so pucker up
Cause you end up messin around catchin the heebiejeebies
Lookin like who done it With your face up on the TV
So next time you want sex get wreck but protect
Cause you could be like sexin to your last death
And if you still dont know the time press rewind
Cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline word
Beep

Oh I believe the fire burns we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us
These are the words of a believer achiever leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and its process
Birth of a son death of another
With love I caress both mothers
And told em whos in control is the one thats above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
Its tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us
Look at the picture hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we havent taught them
Is it what we talking we really aint walking
Dues hustlers pay how much did it cost em
Find myself on the same corner that we lost em
Real talking in their ear like a Walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them I see my baby girl believe
I believe in the light that shines and will never die

With the steel up on the dresser killing will aggressors
Destinys children survivors soldiers
In front of buildings their eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons sirens holsters

Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning shawtys know to keep learning
Lessons in our life are like stripes that we earning
Took gramps advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors
Of a contest that seems beyond us
Even through the unseen I know that God watches
From one Kings dream he was able to Barack us

Nothing can stop us

1746,"I Used to Love HER Lyrics
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
And to the beat Com Sensell be the sure shot come on
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh yo when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
ACom Sense yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
UAC yo we gotta be the sure shot
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me by not preachin to me
But speakin to me in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in LA
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the problack was goin out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into RB hiphouse bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
If you dont check it mmmm bust it bust it
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once The Man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the innercity circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin rock and dressin hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin about poppin Glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now shes a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it but Im committed
Girl hes committed But so many niggas hit it
That shes just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin her and takin her to the sewer
But Imma take her back hopin that the shit stop
Cause who Im talkin about yall is hiphop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Mainframe yo they gotta be the sure shot
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two Com Sense is gonna drop haha
I used to love HER
I used to love HER
I used to love HER
I used to love HER

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell word 
Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally thats confusion to a youngn tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say thats where you go when you die
But how they know
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons it was a blessing not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and thats where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
Thats why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that aint vein to me
Its just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin to go inside
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup 
Living in mass confusion looking for absolution
The gas seducin and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
Momma say its her after me
Preacher say its blasphemy
I say theres gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God heres you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean
We know hey 
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd dont mean I gotta be no sheep
You feel me
More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history
We saying the same thing

545,"I used to be in love with this guy named Sam
I dont know why cause he had the head like that of a clam
But you couldnt tell me nothin cause Sam was number one
Cause to me oh my gosh he was one in a million
I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
That hed use me for my money and then break my heart
But like a fool in love I fell for his game
But I got mine so I show no shame
In Empire winked his eye and then he kept walkin
And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what Im talkin
The roller disco where we all used to go
Just to have some fun back in 1981
You know the place Empire Boulevard
Is where I first saw the nigga and he tried to play hard
But I knew the deal cause I knew his brother Jerry
And Sam he just broke up with his girlfriend Terri
So Jerry introduced Sam and I that night
He said Hello my name is Sam I said Hi my name is Lyte
We yipped and we yapped and we chit and we chat
About this and that from sneakers to hats
He said Look Im in the mood for love
Simply because youre near me
Lets go To my house lay back and get nice
Watch television Riunite On Ice
I said Slow down I know you wanna shake me down
But Im not one of the girls that go rippin around
Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Next month I finally went to his house
I walked into the door there was a girl on the couch
I said Whos the frog the bump on the log
You chump you punk how could you do me wrong
Singing sad songs about your love is so strong
You said Wait Lyte youre confused the girl is my cousin
Your brother agreed but later she said that she wasnt
Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Forgotten next month we went to the Deuce
Well I thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice
You knew the dopes the pushers the addicts everybody
Asked ya how you met em said you met em at a party
Then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff
I said Its not your business so shut the fuck up
They said Okay Lyte think what you wanna think
But its gon be some shit when your man becomes a fiend
I said Look to bust a move I dont even know you
To put it Lyte I really dont care to
They kinda got mad and sort of offended
They said We only lookin out for yo best interest
I said Thanks but no thanks in an aggravated tone
When I wanna find out I find out on my own
Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C
Well Im clawin my thoughts I wonder who she could be
Youre spending all your time with her and not a second with me
They say you spend your money on her and youre with her night and day
Her name starts with a C and it ends with a K
I strain my brain lookin for a name to fit this spellin
But I just couldnt do it cause my heart kept yellin
Burning begging for affection from you Sam
But just like a test I cram to understand you
Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man
But Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Then it came a time you started looking kinda thin
I asked you why you said Exercise tryina stay slim
I bought it even though I knew it was a lie
Cause it really didnt matter you were still lookin fly
But oh no oh no you started askin me for money
Butter me up beg me and call me your honey
So I gave you 2 yards and then I gave you one more
You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door
You came back an hour later and you asked me for a 10
I said I only got a 20 you said Give me that then
I said Nope Ill tell you now you better stop slobbin
Find you a job or you better start robbin
So I stepped off with a giant step
Picked up my belongings and I just left
And now I see you in Empire every Sunday
Juicin the girls up for some money and a lay
But every time I see you doin it I just ruin it
Tell em how ya on crack smoke sniff and chewin it
And as for this girl Miss C oh well
I was shocked as hell when I heard Samuel
When your homeboys told me I almost went wack
That the girl you was addicted to her name was Crack
",shit when your man becomes a fiend I said Look to bust a move I dont even know you To put it Lyte I really dont care to They kinda got mad and sort of offended They said We only lookin out for yo best interest I said Thanks but no thanks in an aggravated tone When I wanna find out I find out on my own Just like a test Jujust like a test Jujust like a test I cram to understand you Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C Well Im clawin my thoughts I wonder who she could be Youre spending all your time with her and not a second with me They say you spend your money on her and youre with her night and day Her name starts with a C and it ends with a K I strain my brain lookin for a name to fit this spellin But I just couldnt do it cause my heart kept yellin Burning begging for affection from you Sam But just like a test I cram to understand you Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man But Just like a test Jujust like a test Jujust like a test I cram to understand you Then it came a time you started looking kinda thin I asked you why you said Exercise tryina stay slim I bought it even though I knew it was a lie Cause it really didnt matter you were still lookin fly But oh no oh no you started askin me for money Butter me up beg me and call me your honey So I gave you 2 yards and then I gave you one more You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door You came back an hour later and you asked me for a 10 I said I only got a 20 you said Give me that then I said Nope Ill tell you now you better stop slobbin Find you a job or you better start robbin So I stepped off with a giant step Picked up my belongings and I just left And now I see you in Empire every Sunday Juicin the girls up for some money and a lay But every time I see you doin it I just ruin it Tell em how ya on crack smoke sniff and chewin it And as for this girl Miss C oh well I was shocked as hell when I heard Samuel When your homeboys told me I almost went wack That the girl you was addicted to her name was Crack,I used to be in love with this guy named Sam I dont know why cause he had the head like that of a clam But you couldnt tell me nothin cause Sam was number one Cause to me oh my gosh he was one in a million I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start That hed use me for my money and then break my heart But like a fool in love I fell for his game But I got mine so I show no shame In Empire winked his eye and then he kept walkin And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what Im talkin The roller disco where we all used to go Just to have some fun back in 1981 You know the place Empire Boulevard Is where I first saw the nigga and he tried to play hard But I knew the deal cause I knew his brother Jerry And Sam he just broke up with his girlfriend Terri So Jerry introduced Sam and I that night He said Hello my name is Sam I said Hi my name is Lyte We yipped and we yapped and we chit and we chat About this and that from sneakers to hats He said Look Im in the mood for love Simply because youre near me Lets go To my house lay back and get nice Watch television Riunite On Ice I said Slow down I know you wanna shake me down But Im not one of the girls that go rippin around Just like a test Jujust like a test Jujust like a test I cram to understand you Next month I finally went to his house I walked into the door there was a girl on the couch I said Whos the frog the bump on the log You chump you punk how could you do me wrong Singing sad songs about your love is so strong You said Wait Lyte youre confused the girl is my cousin Your brother agreed but later she said that she wasnt Just like a test Jujust like a test Jujust like a test I cram to understand you Forgotten next month we went to the Deuce Well I thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice You knew the dopes the pushers the addicts everybody Asked ya how you met em said you met em at a party Then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff I said Its not your business so shut the fuck up They said Okay Lyte think what you wanna think But its gon be some

Another day another Glock fired like were not tired
Hollow men in the wasteland like T S Eliot
Spear stickin out of the flesh of a fresh elephant
News comin out in the press and they just relish it
When your hopes shattered in stress you say To hell with it
This is for my young boars in them gun wars
Out here on their going dumb jawn on the front lawn

And we definitely not goals and we definitely not vows
You can feel it in your soul we aint nothin nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga
Im an unapologist knew women like Solomon
I can burn bridge walk water like the prophets did
I can read niggas futures like astrologists
Why Im so clean Im next thing to Godliness
Niggas try to starve my kids and give my money to his first born
Im not the nigga posed to work for em
You pose the teach culture P about your legacy
And said that niggas follow you you teaching treachery
And now you say you check for me without a check for me
Now what you talkin bout this murder niggas double jeopardy
Niggas sayin let it go you buggin nigga I cant let it be
Tell niggas dont call for me I can only talk for me
I know what my budget read I read the budget every week
Im on the way I talk but its a way out for me
Then they try to dangle money they didnt think Ill ever leave
Niggas never pay the artist but they love to pay the freaks
We aint gang we aint goals we aint family we aint foes and we definitely not bros we aint nothin nigga
And we definitely not goals and we definitely not vows
You can feel it in your soul we aint nothin nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga no we aint nothing nigga no 
We aint nothing nigga no we aint nothing nigga nah
We aint nothing nigga
He that is from above is above them all above them all
Yeah I show up when thunder fall I aint runnin from yall cause I come for it all
Now I fire on Goliath and watch him fall
Didnt want to kill the short first cause I come for the tall
And when your main artist died who the hell did you call
I bring smoke with water on Im used to the fog
And I empty pipes when clips get clogged
And go to church on Sundays Im the illest of all
Dont ever put Mase with other Bad Boys who had hardship
You know I get it jumping like a mosh pit nigga
Im the first level dirt level yall can never hurt level
Niggas mad I made it to the I will never work level
Since Cain killed Abel Im able to kill Cain
And Love dont steal my nigga change your name
And I see no integrity in you name
And Im haunted by the voice of St James
Champagne came matched my Rollie plain jane
And I say blame God I aint changed
And if niggas never found the killer why is nigga livin here
Everybody Brooklyn niggas gotta play a vision here
And niggas be selling their soul to go to a brunch
And niggas might end up sweet drinking that punch
I suffer good and niggas know Im from another hood
So keep your brotherhood Im tryna make sure that my mother good
I ask sheep but Im really goat to the goats
No matter with Top 5 Im the nigga quoted the most
Im the ghost of Wolf ghost of Rezar
I come with the facts you never consider Im a ghost of Shyne
I speak for every artist never spoke their mind
Representing every artist that was left behind
From Craig Mack to GDep
I still remember them kids trample
For every producer you every stole they sample
Why you playing with me Knowin I make examples
Niggas hide behind money you know thats not a man move
You know youre Frank and Im Tony
You know that itll get lonely its never safe when you owe me
You know the sayin true
You has a chance to do right I dont understand you
You cant stop a nigga came from Wick and Cam fool
But Karma came in getting hold of movers
You flow for the man causin Georgia may show his wrist and piss water
He could have made it right that nigga couldve saved his life
Now there aint now way to fight now he out there waving white
Ay know your strategy
Now what you have is being right now I got a mole in your faculty
So when you get the nerve to come after me what audacity
Gotta know the dollar sign wasnt rappin free
Actually after BIG died what a travesty
Cause when Mase left nigga wouldnt nobody after me
I guess I got the last laugh niggas aint laughing huh
Niggas stay strapping up Im ready for a massacre
Cam blackballed Mase the ball aint black enough
Tupac for us nigga I aint even mad at ya
Pretty nigga always make they hearts melt yeah
Guess you can say I know how Pac felt yeah
Im just a Harlem nigga reppin down a Vegas strip with my own Suge
You from Mount Vernon go and rep your own hood
Im not hating on your billi worth
Right now Im only saying what you really worth
You aint no architect
You just a nigga who know how to market death
Go pay his momma what hes really worth nigga

In Mexico fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it the wrist is magic
The left is Patek Philippes replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature

While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Cant you see my Total Pam Kima Keisha
Im aiming for the moguls why yall niggas aiming at the locals
And rap niggas broke like them theyre mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like interior gauze
It feels like still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceilings open I CrossFit the coca

These kilos are drought killers I flooded the Jess I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across

Up steps the one and only in the flesh
Senegalese Sierra Leonian fresh to death
Big homie and them reps the best
Knew you knew me from somewhere
I get wrecked with Questlover
The brother get it on bring a song
More brutal than Genghis Khan
Whose name ring alarms to fakes
You couldnt place but know Im the truth
Thats before you recognize its the one from The Roots
Armed to the tooth trying got take an eye for another eye
Im from we hear gunfire for a lullaby
Yo forget it who the hell am I
Yo Im the reason these MCs lives became nullified
The stuff of legend so tell me whats tougher brethren
Well Im the blast form the past that started the present
Vision of the future me and the super producer
And Im ten times as smart as Im used to being
Im still seeing the voice through the speakers
Porsche two seaters Jimmy Choo sneakers
Real rap remedy man a true genius
I brought Yosemite Sam two heaters
Asking these bastards if its any last word
Besides what when why and all them adverbs
You bout to be the next fugitive captured
Just keep thinking you can lie and live after
Slow your roll playboy rabbit ears
Cause damn right its on sight like Vladimir
And by the moment of time you will be out of here
Scrap get slapped for acting so cavalier
Im from Philly and them cabbers dont travel there
Brothers let the heat rattle there
They dont battle there
Itching to leave you in the pool like Mike Phelps
Learning to fight might help but thats light help
Cause the bullets make flak melt
Then just imagine what itd do to you even if you a black belt
Ayo my brother still concealing with a gat held
On a block where there used to be a lot of crack dealt
Lo and behold this is information overload
I put the crowd in a trance like Paul Oakenfold
I used to be the lowest on the totem pole
Until I reconstructed my goals left a broken mold
Setting sights on the open road
I hit them anywhere and everywhere the realness is bought and sold
Ayo they got me on the honor role
That mean whenever speaking my name
Begin that with The Honorable
TAR one I like a monocle
I bring the riot to a laugh cause you comical
Look get in that ass like your father do
Hit that catatonic chronic out in Bonnaroo
Im psychological jump like Geronimo
Probably get yourself knocked down like a domino
Whoa if I dont work then I wont eat
No I dont Facebook but I might Tweet
The industry is out of control like OC
So take this L on the chin like its a goatee
Im kinda like a cellar door lowkey
I used to mix bottles of champagne with OE
Im Aristotle I cant fail Im OG
I came through to get free like no fee
Ayo they got me on the pedestal trophy
Got them singing Damn Riq cheating like adultery
Sycamore sitting on paper like upholstery
Noam Chomsky Im on an organized rhyme spree
Messing with this is borderline robbery
And thats what it is im jimbrowski
Certain circles call me the Big Lebowski
It would behoove you to find out about me
Agh ahhhh Whoa hohoho
You whack rappers better step your game up
Wow give it up for Black Thought one of the greatest of all time
Man man man man Man dude
I dont know if any dude got anymore lyrics than this dude right here
The Roots are here we celebrating the release of their new album and then you shoot your cousin

712,"We must love and support each other 
We have nothing to lose but our chains
We have nothing to lose but our chains 
Now you say that shit so loud them motherfuckers outside hear you
It is our duty to fight for our freedom
It is our duty to fight for our freedom 
It is our duty to win It is our duty to win 
We must love and support each other
We must love and support each other 
We have nothing to lose We have nothing to lose 
We have nothing to lose We have nothing to lose 
We have nothing to lose We have nothing to lose 
But our chains But our chains 
Send this one out to
To the mothers they neglected to the fathers they rejected 
To the sisters disrespected to the brothers unprotected 
All of us all of us all of us all of us all of us
We send this one out to
To the mothers they deceited to the fathers they mistreated 
To the sisters they misleaded to the brothers that get beated 
All of us all of us all of us all of us all of us
This is happening to all of us
Yeah if our struggle is a strain then the strain is dominant
My name is prominent for entertainment thats laced with consciousness
But really its just common sense like Lonnie Lynn
You dont need binoculars to see the light coming through the dome like its an oculus
The common myth that were savages with no history or accomplishments
Or knowledge of ourselves they did a job on us
Considering the prediction of economists machines will do our jobs for us
The future for the working class is ominous
They got us indoctrinated through a bitchs brew a religion mixed in with abuse
Emotional we sit in pews its physical we get the noose
And hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves refuse to change ourselves
When I talk about our past it doesnt ring a bell
They make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
Theyll take you from your family your kids will never respect ya
Attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message
We start acting if we cracking the whip better than the oppressor yes
Every problem cant be solved at the ballot box
We unifying Africa like Gaddafi thats what got Malcolm shot
They out to stop anybody with knowledge that figured out the plot
On the balcony like Martin Luther King I been to the mountaintop
The blue wall of silence its really the blue wall of violence
The good cops who retire and get fired
They screaming black on black as an excuse for you to not care
Til the cops roll up in their SWAT gear
I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan
Sweating all through the night just like the Holy Prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with J Cole and Kweli
Just before Jehovah the God crowned me the king with his goldie locket
Alhamdulillah weve come really far aint it
The little engine who could could power any car cant it
The mothers in Chiraq say the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times the holy Quran and Bible
We on the last page and line the verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the matrix inside of the spaceship but the saviors blind
Or so it seems years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs
I hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways
Officer friendly is an enemy now looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the asiatic ancientsemitic peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple
To the mothers they neglected to the fathers they rejected 
To the sisters disrespected to the brothers unprotected 
All of us all of us all of us all of us all of us
We send this one out to
To the mothers they deceited to the fathers they mistreated 
To the sisters they misleaded to the brothers that get beated 
All of us all of us all of us all of us all of us

All of us all of us all of us all of us all of us

Weve got to live
Live to the end we gotta do we do 
Weve got to live for our grandmothers 
Live to the end and granddaddies too 
Weve got to live live for the babies

The truck or the Lambi Cam be stuffed in some candy

Fine play I keep it neutral but my familys nine trey
Soo woo my Aalikes that stay to fight from day to night

They wont play it if I cold get ill
But Im like that and thats an actual fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I dont do dope but Im dope not a dope
But Im doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme Im displayin
And the beat thats playin
Yo you could try allday
And you still wont match up with the Ruthless POW
Cause Eazys doin it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo its easier said than done
Woo woo
Now its easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya dont ya might get lost
Im not a role model or a Dr Seuss yo Im a gangsta
And Im about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trauma
With the EAZYE comma now thats drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
Im comin off hard in the third dimension
With the glare
But you dont need no glasses to stare
Itll probably take you in and its just like youre there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think Im a flip or slip dont even trip
Cause Im a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on Ruthless and thats my label
To get the money the women and cold bust the fat cables boy
Master Rhymes a toy
I mean straight while you suckin with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or you lonely
How you gonna diss me if you dont even know me Yo Ren 
Whassup
Get the gat show em where its at
And thats just the sound
And next time Im peelin your cap
To let you know where Im comin from
Eazy said it and it shall be done
Woo woo
Creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
Eazyer Said Than Dunn yeah thats the title
Lovin the ladies only the fly ones ya know
But what if shes ugly
Eazy come Eazy go
Dont ask to battle me homeboy whats that
You wanna battle me Boy ya better be strapped
Cause where Im from it aint all about that playin
Now thats what Im sayin
Said before that I was born in 73
Now everybody wants to know the AGE
Girls on the tip fellas too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin I was only 15
The fellas would ignore me
The ladies would adore me
And what was I to do
I wish theyd let the ladies through
Cause the ladies I love em
Nice tender and soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
Im the real Eazy those others be fakin
Tryin to gain fame off the name Im makin
Sayin on your records you could get some
Yo homeboy its easier said than done
Woo woo

Nam myoho renge kyo
Ask Tina love aint got shit to do with me and you
Or the 44 under the pillow
Put in the dildo I like to play while Im workin
And thats for certain
Keep jerkin I aint done with you
Lights cameras curtains
In a second
The show begins
Invite your family and friends
They gotta see this
Oh they wouldnt believe this
You got stuck and left naked with a hard penis
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe

Out on me by your man Big D
Stink cucarachas I bought his life for 3 Gs
Then some watches then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin goin on
We caught him down at the Shark Bar up in Marks car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin in they Morays sippin Dom Ps and Cristies
I reminisce how it used to be
On the run from police we bust shotties out of Maseratis
Bloody bodies in the telly lobbies
When in need I lied for ya I cried for ya
You know this downass bitch woulda died for ya
I used to sweat you but now forget you
Id rather dead you and wet you like I never met you

With the passion
High fashion
Who you askin
To keep the tum numb from index to thumb
Push the Vs with the coke from the DTs
Dope take the titties from city to city
I aint see a G off none of them kis
At ease when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if I didnt snitch youd make a shorty rich bitch
I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin on the Peter Pan to Maryland
Was worth the bitch marryin
This nigga I so worked so hard for
Chose my life to be hardcore
Laws didnt appeal no more
Gats I couldnt feel no more
And now Im the shit
Go by the name of Lil Kim the Queen Bitch
And MAFIAs lieutenant
Instead of playin Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream and dinero
It dont pay to be nice but its nice to pay
And if you die before you wake may your soul God take

Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores

Started sellin white we wont sell it no more
Im like Trump aint feelin us cops still killin us
Niggas takin shots cant stop me they aint real enough
Cut her off act like shes dead and its killin her
New Dawn Hermes seat I let the ceiling up
Just to kill em softly ooh get em off me
Try to crucify me like Im Jesus the way she cross me
Im too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo on point like an arrow
We started off with zero now Im seein Ms
Diamonds like water and they jumpin out the gym
Shootin like Harden if your head was the rim
Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim damn
Back when I was broke they was cool with it
Now every move I make Im in the news with it
Even if I aint do it they be like You did it
My teacher always used to tell me You gon lose nigga
Thats why I never went to school nigga
And why Im rappin like I got somethin to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp I get two with it
Move with it cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin thotties in the Phantom thats the way of life
And make em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin for the Glock every time I play the light
Im on 12 oclock every time I play them bikes
Im with the pack uh gettin back yeah
Spendin dope nigga sellin smack gang
Im gettin chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah 10 mil in cash of Ethika thats a fact
Money power respect eatin breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset they aint see me fall yet
Wins and losses
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
Im on some shit that they aint seen before
Dream chasin catchin all my goals
And I dont need these whores

Play with me you know its allout war
The young niggas goin all out for us
Bloggers in a frenzy truck to the Bentley
Aint doin no interviews Im busy nigga we litty
So when you see me out dont ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens we was servin fiends
40 bust your windows out Jazmine Sullivan
They told em pop Mollys I told em to be kings
Sippin 1942 like its lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So Ima give it to em every time Im on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it I go through it dont show it
I told niggas who wrote it aint takin back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon rob me put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing bout Meek Milly Ima get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan totin Ks like its Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
Im on some shit that they aint seen before
Dream chasin catchin all my goals
And I dont need these whores
Im gettin money me and all my woes
Play with me you know its allout war

Rain sleet on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap we started poppin though
Heard that bitch say she cut me I was like adis
In the field knock em down it look like dominoes

When you get a dollar they gon hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies now they straight nigga

3168,"Yeah
I wanna share some shit with yall
All truth all truth
Uh like Im standing inside a Tabernacle
I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
I started out as a battle rapper
All I knew was Maxells ADATs DATs and gats
Uh my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
Recovering alcoholic I grew up on 9 Mile
Uh Im not a gangster drug dealer or thug nigga
Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
Now sometime around 95 I found my calling
And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see
My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
Hallelujah Im the son of a addict
My addiction was music all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
And listen to Redman and Heltah Skeltah
Aye yall remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called
Sean Price be like Im not sure any yeah that was my shit
I used to bump that shit all day
By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist
I didnt want to be anything else
You know but my mom had plans for me
She wanted me to go to school so you know
Uh to make moms happy I took some general courses in college
Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
Because the bus stop I had to walk to
Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
As soon as I stepped foot in the openmic it was like a reunion
I was a shoein
I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
And that was back in like let me see
97 my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
And the way he started blessing me uh
I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
Needless to say that December 29th was the day I became a believer in fate
Okay now its December 28th my day has gone great
Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
I got a call from my girls people saying shes in labor
In the hospital right now 9th floor
I get on the elevator elevator stops on the 5th floor
Elevator opens up my uncles standing there crying
Now Im caught off guard Im like What the fuck
My uncle standing there like Ryan they that way
I walk out I see my momma and that entire side of my family
Looking like theres some kind of drama happenin
I said What happened They like Grannys been in a bad accident
And it aint looking good Im like Man what
Im having a baby four floors up before I froze up
Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
Or maybe chose me to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
My momma said The baby here yet I said Maybe
She said Maybe Baby go see
I walk away feeling like a good father the same time as a terrible son
Get to my girl she 5 centimeters dilated so I waited
She got to get to bout nine til its that time
And meanwhile Im more popular in this hospital than the doctors
Nurses watching whispering like Thats the one right there
Who got a lady in labor on 9 and another lady dying on 5
By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show
Somebody had to remind me the doors was already open at the venue
I got emotions runnin every which way
All the nurses and stuff is like Well keep you posted about the baby
Well keep you posted about your granny
I didnt like seeing my mama like that so I had to get out of there
Yeah I hit the stage at 1150 killed it
I got off at about midnight with about six types
Of different emotions floatin around inside me
Hopeless tryna find me hopin in time Godll guide me
In the future just as I was about to leave out
I saw Kino talkin to Marshall and then he introduced us
We talked about collaboratin and how chasin this rap thing is aggravatin
But Ill get back I got the family waitin
I get to skatin
As soon as I get to the hospital they tell me that my granny didnt make it
She just died Im feelin helpless it hurt me
On the flip side my little boy is healthy in the nursery
I picked him up looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried
Aint no denyin this is the power of God
I said I love you Granny and looked to the sky
Like even though he just got here goodbye
This is how the story goes
Powerful day now you know powerful day now you know 
Most significant day in my life
I mean aside from meetin my man Marshall
My son bein born and my granny dying on the same day
My grandma didnt live anywhere near that hospital
I learned a lot this day
I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
It showed me that God is real God is real
And you know what they say God giveth God taketh away

Her hips tossed back and forth
Side to side and up and down
She touched the ground it turned me out
Im battling desire

This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo

Belly dancing in a circle

Enough to make a weak nigga go mano y mano

Four inch whips on a buggy six
First class trips and the bubblys Cris

Yeah I got her she hop in the ride so I could holla
My favorite girl outside of my Impala

The innocent role aint workin work harder
I aint tryin to lock you down Im no father
But maybe we can go further if you just listen
Its hard as hell for a man in my position
To pick a good girl out you gotta know the difference
I wonder if its even in one in existence
Enough to keep my attention to go the distance
And Im have to look hard to find a better one
Cause yo sex is a 187 hon
You get a nigga doin shit I aint never done
So now even when Im on tour I let her come

22,"Alright listen Im back again cause thats what you required of
Me steady rhyming and Im so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But Im not buying so never sound like I dont bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me cease it you dont know me
So dont smile in my face behind my back take a line or two
Im not an idiot so who you think you lying to
Queen Latifahs here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because its a showdown
The 45 King is arising suprising hypnotising star hes up to par
So I hope youve prepared yourself for what youre in for
This is Latifahs Law
BMWs and gold rope chains dont impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed you nose will bleed thats how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype Im sorry your sound died
Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and hoping that Im soft but Im dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life its trife yeah but these things happen
You need to make it better stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the African way
Cause theres a sucker born every day
Crimes the way for you to see what the Queen saw
And this is Latifahs law
Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The Flavor Unit keeps all and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall cause Im heavyhanded
Whip out a 45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to Africa cant forget my other land
Wont fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say youre living right but we know its nonsense
In case you forgot just check your conscience
At showtime I blow lines you dont get yours I get mine
Your showtimes you behind the Queen Latifah divine
Rule number one dont step across the line that I drew
Number two dont take credit for something that you didnt do
Number three check your heart every man has a call
Its time for me to go but Ill be back yall

Now Rubio was taught to gather everything that could be gotten
In school he learned an awful on how he could become a lawyer or physician
Not because that was his earthly mission but that lifes all about the jackpot
And teachers only in it for the earnins
Now memorize the knowledge only to forget it later now its worthless
But never taught a sense of purpose
Cause happiness is money focused on what you can get instead of service
In graduation he was nervous
He didnt know which way to go which way the wind would take him
Determined not let the pressures of life bend or break him
No more allowance now its him that must bring home the bacon
He stands behind the counter
And hour after hour
He takes commands that he cant stand
Feelin as though no power
Is in his hands to take a man
He wants to stop and leave
But remains realistic he was never taught to dream

Now Ana graduated school with top honors
And to her parents and her family a lot promised
Started to study to become a doctor
When she was young she used to sing and mesmerize the crowd that used to watch her
She thought about recording
But then decided that was far from a sure thing
And with the house to ride the loot and all the money flowing
She feels a void inside does she enjoy the ride
And really wheres she going
And every time she sees a singer on a stage she ponders
The present circumstances is the life that she belongs to
And all the money does is seem to fill the empty void
Its like shes living out a life she really dont belong to
And will she ever know
May talent ever flow
Some people see the life of fear will make them never go
She saw the ledge but couldnt jump off of the top and leap
But remains realistic she was never taught to dream
This is for the dreamer in you
Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do

And were not taught to dream just get the dough
And wonder why the youth result to hustlin
And no one wants to be behind the counter money crunchin
And when you speak your dreams most people quickly change discussions
Cause dreams they come and go
And scientists deliver mail
Poets work customer sales
Authors teach at yale
Forces off and then derailed  
And money rules his soul buried deep in economics
He never smiles but deep inside him is a brilliant comic
Free thinkers caught behind limited logic
Will never look beyond the stars because they cannot see beyond their wallets
Dont keep it safe cause everything else will be too extreme
So on lunch break they drift off in American day dream

Abstract Queens cat what we lookin at
Sixth sense too immense smellin is the fact
Out here you got your shiesty cats stabbin back for some track
Until we take it back you probly wont be feelin rap
Wordsworth Brooklynite what it lookin like
5 senses 9 inches 5 foot in height
Out here you got ya crooks and heists shook and shiest look alike
Payed off the books from dice good lookin and hookin tight
Us you they and them
Yo Her and him
We make it blend I say we makin it blend
Yo Uhuhuhuhuhuh
Cmon
Back when I came out first joint I hit it out
New styles to talk bout new ground to walk about
Still breakin shit wit the hammer of Thor god
Bigger than Asgard hittin ya ass hard
Act it out cause theres no time to word shit
You never win wit Wordsworth the wordsmith
The verse gets tighter every second the earth twists
Heard its QTip and Words you had to purchase
Prefer this now wait a minute whats that I heard skip
Nerves twitch played this so much its probably your third disc
On purpose at your service basement to surface
Learn this how can you rehearse somethin thats perfect
Isnt it funny when you use your favorite pen
And get your rhyme pad write shit thats truly bad
Embarrass yourself make a fuckin mockery
End the hypocrisy you never toppin me
Im the monopoly in jail is your cacophonies of unfair policies
In there youre rottin B
You hit the lottery well then you spottin me
Im extortin you of all your natural bodilies
Ayo it gotta be the way I respond that makes you honor me
Song hittin award winnin yall just the nominees
Play it safe Ill arrange your wake
My paper mate will have my label mates album released a later date
Police patrol the city til Im as old as 50
Hat back clothes wont fit me causin 50 to frisk me
My hands are ammunition banned like contraband in prison
Im who you wanna be blowin out your candles wishin
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend

Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Make makin it blend
Yo I like a woman wit a bangin body the face and frame of Halle
Attitude angry snotty
Speaks slang and cocky
Time to hang Aint gotta bring a posse
Through rainy days she got me like Whitney stay wit Bobby
Yo your cake is in the kitchen your wishful premonition
Is turned around by my firm thoughts of demolition
Its time to numb your run and dim your vision
Its time to give up the hopes and dreams of major acquisition
Aint got a droptop that goes 0 to 60
But after shows ladies drop tops and show they titties
Across the globe you cant oppose its risky
Or even go against me
Im Words so every time that you flow you spit me
We in the asphalt you cause your last fall
Insult to injury is when we curse the salt
Douse the open wound to the tomb
Its time to sit back and watch professionals in full bloom
Us you they and them
Yo Her and him
We make it blend I say we makin it blend
Yo Uhuhuhuhuhuh

Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
If you a faker stop hallucinating
Stop procrastinating we dont run with traitors
We so real were so bout it bout it pimping
Aint no cash flowing unless its strictly stricken
Aint no weed blowing unless youre going half
Aint no liquor pouring until you pay your tab
Aint no bitches bending over backwards 
Steady pouring something that I lack 
And stack up with money were loaded to death 
These niggas thats bummy they hate me to death 
But none of these niggas will step on the scene
And go oneonone they value their health
They know Ill slap a ho straight to the moon
Like I was an animal sadistic goon
Your life is in danger when niggas assume
When you fuck around with my money thats doom 
Power to people that hustle like me
247 they grind these streets
Shine like gemstones when I creep
Ooh blind mine enemies
I dont know the definition of sleep
If I couldnt starve I wouldnt eat 
So my main focus is my cheese
And slap any ho that dont heed ugh
If she a prob if she cool
If she a dog if she rude
If she a prob if she cool
If she a dog if she rude Yeah 
Slap a ho x8
Backing them up pushing them down
Blocks up Im knocking them down
Coked up fucking around
Pee on the nose my writing gross
Microphone sipping Patron
Breaking the center slap the dungs
Make them sung like Simone
Drawers made by Louis Vuitton
What we design slimes
Block clop fizzy activity
Diggitywiggity dickitynickity

The girls with titties slang dope
You make it rain more
Come fly to Ukraine spazz up
Hop in the truck pop your dog
Get tummy tucked run and duck

489,"Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk
White miniskirt with a Betty Boop bum
She had an ass like Deborah Cox face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
At times she got my dingaling hard
When she said push hard she kept Vaseline
Open as she swung back couldnt help her dress blew back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rocking Wallows
Drawing cards sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolemite few tips from Goines
Birthday gave her two fifty cent coins
Puppy love gorgeous face amazed by lip gloss
Cherry scent when the princess spoked yo it bounched off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs Cole
Girls so pretty kids with little biddies hope the years go slow slow
Surrounded by intelligence life through education healthy minds will grow grow
Catch me on a busstop dusted cursin out the cops
But still come and vibe with me
Everybodys talking about WuTang fronting
But you still telling lies to me
Beautiful in lightshows having no intentions on love
But having strung I suppose here we go
Its not the way she bubbed the gum
Shooked her ass Im not the one
Double dutch waiting for the bus with faggot Laurie son
Now N Later lady 7th floor building 780
Fancy fox booties for her socks nothing else can change me
Young Nefertiti knowledge seed with no jewelry on
Tahitian fresh berry tree shes a capricorn
I really liked the girl had dreams about her
Thinking to myself some nights she got louder 
But hating was Sheneneh and Grace and Keylolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me you hit me Grace got the last hit
Eh yo the bitches started swinging and shit so I jumped in
Those were the days made faces in school plays
Paper trays city wide test made half a days
Shooting puppy water might hump the pillow dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga Ill pop her cherry for her
Fresh Air Fund nails done alphabets berets

If somebody start cappin aint no tellin what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck thats when Imma have to fuck you up
Its like Uh ah
Muthafucka cant fight the feelin the way Imma fuck him
Have an orgasm and before the morgue has him killed him as if a fourfive bucked him
Talk about a man being scared
I done killed him he dead in his tomb still shakin
Hit him in his body and his head
Now he found up in heaven with the wound still achin
I wonder if his voice still breakin
Better be cause I readily
Hit him with gats and styles thats heavily
Armed and dangerous and deadly
Them ahead of me receive two holes like a letter B
Better you instead of me
Break our peace can increase your chances
To delete your advances
If its faint I can paint this piece on canvas
With a paint brush that a nigga cant trust
Like a god so I cant rush wont crush
If you ever heard about a crew that cant bust then muthafucka it aint us dont touch
A mic or a gun if you aint gonna use it do it
Claimin your weapons and TEC
And you gonna be ejecting fluid prove it
Cause no matter who it 
Is KTown and Westsidell leave a bitch sheddin tears
The young kill everyday the old itchin to kill cause they aint left nigga dead in years
Shoot him dead in his head
This style of flow is a verbal Calico make a chest ripple

Off on the rage even if its just a little bit so goon with the riddle shit
If you got something to stress then get it off your chest and we can take it to the middle bitch and go on
Get it on and I bet you that the outcome is that Im leavin niggas outdone cut up
Bullets hard to see a muthafucka outrun just because he let his mouth run shut up
And sit back if you know whats good for you I can still overthrow you

Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions overpowering
Over the competition Im towering
Wrecking shop when I drop

Just like Muhammad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr Smith dont riff
Listen to my gear shift
Im blasting outlasting
Kinda like Shaft so you could say Im shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

Drownin in my sorrow drinkin liquor tryin to smoke alone
Argue with my wife so I broke my phone
Threw it on the wall tryin to ball but they playing zone
Connect is acting funny with the work
Like my money didnt work they gon end up getting merked
The label acting funny with the deal
Like the shit that I be spittin on the record wasnt real
Hood mad but they know a nigga ride
But the anger and jealousy can blow a nigga high
The other day I said I know a nigga fucked
When I played the bodega it was two dollars for the Dutch
To keep it real we living in real time
And I feel a niggas pain but they never can feel mine
And so Im on the go with the green light
I dont even sleep how the fuck could I dream right
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh but Imma do me you can say whatever

Ghost never on that swag shit
Guess its a sad thing my tarot card is magic
I remember I aint never have shit
December was cold but February was drastic
So pardon my niggas and what they traffic
Or if they seem cold when the murder scenes tragic
Niggas can talk shit we dont even glimpse
Niggas can get hit we dont even wince
Come with an entourage and I dont mean Vince
Purple ape in a purple Porsche of course Im playing Prince
Or looking through the sky light my light
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights
Blowin on a long Dutch inhale
How I lie Id rather die than be in jail
Its all good til its all bad
And the ugly niggas gon crash your broads pad
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh but Imma do me you can say whatever

I keep it moving in my new JOs
On them blocks where them young boys move llello
They salute like Whattup OG I salute
Cause its the Wild Wild West like Kool Moe Dee
What they do for a twodoor B and a nice watch
Blow your brains out when the cocaine price drop
Like yeah I know my man got life ock
The game dont stop so pull the weed out your nike sock
Yeah Its like that aint it
My down South niggas that got the Lex painted
My East coast niggas that got the Benz kitted
Dont it hurt when they snitch and you found out your friends did it
I thought its money over bitches but
Niggas throw money at bitches so lets kick it
If you really live by the G code
Shoot a couple of guns hurry up and reload

Loving you I shouldnt
You take me chain me
I have nothing anymore
You want a regular dude but you think that Im what you need
You gonna get in your mood wanna bitch in every text you read
Sometimes I think I wanna let you breathe but Im the enemy if I set you free
I gotta let you know that it gets to me ready or not like a refugee
You complaining when I see you
That I never have time that Im busy as a beaver
Foul face when i feed ya
Really need hennessy that be my fucking reliever
Why you wanna stand and cry the most
Are you thinkin that Im for you to try the coke
To knot the hole really wanna tie the ropes
Say by default and hang Nina by the throat
You must really like my imperfections
Cause you stay on dismay temper detections
And thats nightly too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
What did you ever see in me
Was I only what it needed be
Im running away from your judgement
Dont you try to find me
I wont let you change me anyway anyway
Yo Im feeling stoned now
Sick of having those breakdowns they gone now
Its on now Ive grown foul its wrong how weve shown clouds
You keep your tone out of my dome gal
Im sick of this shit
All the picking and the pulling I dont dig it a bit
Living and learn what I want and what Im giving em living em digging a ditch
Dick I wanna fit up in this
You stayed out of my premises
But you aint supposed to be my nemesis
Wanna be in to kiss never to finish it
What happened to close friends with benefits
Im mad as hell
Cause I wanna be back when we had it well
All this statics problematic like grabbing a rabbits tail
And thats nightly too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
What did you ever see in me
Was I only what it needed be
Im running away from your judgement
Dont you try to find me
I wont let you change me anyway anyway
Inside I wanna find somewhere I can hide
Away from all the faded dreams and tainted lies
I wanna tear you up and love you all at once
You quit and score so give me more
Give me more give me more
Dont tell me everythings okay
Im only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me
Dont tell me everythings okay
Im only dying just to be
Your one and only everything
And all you do is kill me
You point out all my imperfections but yet you stay
Thats nervewrecking
I cant live this way

In America one tradition that lasts
Is black blood woven into the fibers o the flag
Not addressing the problems of the past
To nowhere fast but following the path
So called leaders on hire for the Klan
Still rapin and settin fire to the land
Well thats the climate how can I become a man

One killer one child one weapon
The shooter was unthreatened seventyone seconds
So many unanswered questions I see reflections of myself

Too long before the shooter was arrested
So wrong worldwide weve been affected
To them its real sins of the father remembered still
For every Trayvon Martin there was an Emmett Till
You killed my son
How many more kids will we wait for them to kill
My tears collectin like raindrops on the windowsill
If the wounds heal the memories never fade
I wonder if youre in heavens eleventh grade

Cool tears obscure my sight

Disappear inside you every time I clutch you
Tears shed in your presence render walls humble
They separate me from you until I become you
Let em fall to rubble let the darkness crumble
Let your light penetrate me til my heart is trustful
Im afflicted with my chest constricted
And your description is the best prescription
Crack the stone in my chest and let it beat again
Til every artery become a pharmacy
Let it deliver your love to every part of me
Until the splendor of your presence is all I see
My death wish is to decorate my every inch

And relied on whats inside me to guide me sincerely

Lead me directly to your threshold standing at the gate
I breathed in a sweet breath that you had let go
And somewhere in the distance heard your echo
My soul began to tremble
You resemble every mercy Ive ever known
Overwhelmed me so that I began to let it flow
My lenses started welcoming the guests of tears
And suddenly the world revealed itself crystal clear
Colors grew vibrant and the decoration vivid
In that very instant I knew every thing was living

Weve arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America We were promised a better life in our home countries where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury Some corporations are more efficient than government but their motivation is not the health or the wellbeing of the people its only about profit Everything elsetheir image their human resources their public relationsonly exist to protect the reality behind it Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture by those who never had our interests at heart They didnt care about our survival or wellbeingthey just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land by exploiting our people our industry and our resources They took everything we built and made it theirs first by creating racism to justify slavery building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty everything we had was still owned by them Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God
Open your eyes before you die 
And while some used missionaries and donations to offset this abuse other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes using war disease and sanctions that killed millions They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people because their loyalty was to those who enabled them and stored them and kept them in power They became the bastard children of American industry kleptocracy governments of thievery They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars right wing death squads execute political dissidents sympathetic clergy and even overthrow democratically elected governments And so the age of revolution began again They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market But the free market has never been free because the market does not regulate itself It is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image Destroy the image and the enemy will die Such is the same in the rap industry But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World When they need new assets new artists to prostitute a sideins and put on a shelf to use their songs when they needed new concepts music and publishing to steal from the producers they came to the underground to the Third World They took our culture our property and our industry and our resources even using our own people to help them exploit us But behind the mask of efficiency they claimed that we need them to succeed Theyre no better than us Their economic advertising was always a lie A few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth almost as if it was designed for failure Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture glittering rented jewelry the cars the IMF loans the seeds with suicide genes 20year contracts and oil blood money Build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters Theyll stop at nothing to get what they want They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward But the super powers are no less corrupt theyve just learned to disguise it better cause they fix elections too they embezzle tax money they go to war for resources they fund terrorism for their own benefit And when theres enough at stake historys taught us that theyll even assassinate their own presidents

",to war against their own people to preserve those profits The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars right wing death squads execute political dissidents sympathetic clergy and even overthrow democratically elected governments And so the age of revolution began again They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market But the free market has never been free because the market does not regulate itself It is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image Destroy the image and the enemy will die Such is the same in the rap industry But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World When they need new assets new artists to prostitute a sideins and put on a shelf to use their songs when they needed new concepts music and publishing to steal from the producers they came to the underground to the Third World They took our culture our property and our industry and our resources even using our own people to help them exploit us But behind the mask of efficiency they claimed that we need them to succeed Theyre no better than us Their economic advertising was always a lie A few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth almost as if it was designed for failure Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture glittering rented jewelry the cars the IMF loans the seeds with suicide genes 20year contracts and oil blood money Build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters Theyll stop at nothing to get what they want They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward But the super powers are no less corrupt theyve just learned to disguise it better cause they fix elections too they embezzle tax money they go to war for resources they fund terrorism for their own benefit And when theres enough at stake historys taught us that theyll even assassinate their own presidents WAKE UP Just as the Columbia represents mans highest aspirations in the field of science so too does the struggle of the Afghan people represent mans highest aspiration for freedom and I am dedicating on behalf of the American people the March 22nd launch of the Columbia Space Shuttle to the people of Afghanistan,Were here because of you Were here because you were there Weve arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America We were promised a better life in our home countries where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury Some corporations are more efficient than government but their motivation is not the health or the wellbeing of the people its only about profit Everything elsetheir image their human resources their public relationsonly exist to protect the reality behind it Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture by those who never had our interests at heart They didnt care about our survival or wellbeingthey just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land by exploiting our people our industry and our resources They took everything we built and made it theirs first by creating racism to justify slavery building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty everything we had was still owned by them Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God Open your eyes before you die And while some used missionaries and donations to offset this abuse other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes using war disease and sanctions that killed millions They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people because their loyalty was to those who enabled them and stored them and kept them in power They became the bastard children of American industry kleptocracy governments of thievery They protected the corporations and went
124,"We need to have a conversation
I made you why would I play you
Trade home base for a California angel
Swing at a fast bitch foul out betray you
When I wont even wanna hit it in a day or two
Straight home Id run well thats debatable
I cant front I hit a slump all players do
But tough times are minor to a major dude
We all lose sometimes I call it paying dues
Now youre searching other clubs for whats available
A year ago my slot was unassailable
My feast is a famine without you to cater to
If these walls could talk what would they say to you
Dont understand what were going though
But its like you dont know me
And I dont know you no more
Not no more
And its like damn how the hell we get here
No idea but were not what we were before
Could it be that I dont love you
And you dont love me no more
That girl dont live here not no more
Yeah yeah yeah that girl no more
The dining room has an empty chair
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair
House full of company but no ones here
Were saying cheers while were holding back tears
To keep up appearances in front of our peers
We play holiday card tricks every year
Black jack poker make the joker disappear
The ace cant breathe when theres tension in the air
Three clubs in one night but nobody cares
Cause its still not a full house without a pair
You tipped your hand but the text wasnt clear
Youre dealing from the bottom queen of hearts play fair
Slip in the door you hold my hopes so
All I hear is love dont live here anymore
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold
Were sitting on a fence so where you wanna go
Youre the architect of your life its your show
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow
Before you burn the house down think take it slow
Even arsonists needs shelter let me know

Ayo it took A Keys and JayZ to get this city poppin now
Rob Base Snoop Dogg to get it rockin now
Big money talking Mayweather Paquiao
Gucci soft up cause he cant hard top it now
Now what you boys got a death wish
I beat a muhfucka uglier than Precious
Real nigga you can find me where the X is
Whippin in the kitchen both hands ambidextrous
Recession got the hood pushin more than time clocks
So I dropped a hundred in the streets I dont buy stocks
Tell a little muhfucka get his shine pa
Goodfellas hood fellas livin on my block
Nigga got a problem I solve em solve em 
A couple keys yes nigga well rob em rob em 
Got the 9 milli in my pants case you niggas wanna dance

Hard labor for your racist Caucasian bosses

My side chick is still burning out my dick is scorching
Talkin bout I think Im pregnant Im not with abortion
Any child that slides out you is an instant orphan
Thats why its nothing left to be for these hoes but a bitch
It aint nothing left to heat on the stove but a brick
It aint nothing left to eat for the po but the rich
As the Lord swings the pendulum
Time to divvy up your pieces with the deal

Dodging these piranhas tryna rob me thots around me hollering Date rape

3210,"What you want you aint gon get it
What you need you wont admit it
It really dont matter how hard you try
Cause money cant buy respect
The material mind is enticed by the dollar bill
It makes some brothers fight and some would even kill
Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think theyll get respect
Bought a big Mercedes and you got about ten more cars
Now you impress the ladies and youre a neighborhood star
Gold on your fingers and your neck
But you still get no respect
Your mind is weak so when you speak
Youre obsolete your mental peak
Is in the street your mouths a beak
Big like a bird and your futures bleak
Now you should seek some help decree
Youre sellin crack and livin cheap
Bought a brandnew ride to go beepbeep
Playin music outside loud in your jeep
But you should know unless youre slow
There comes an end to the sidewalk show
And up the rivers where youll go
Wearin stripes from head to toe
No fancy gold no fancy car
And the brothers inside dont care who you are
A 7foot brother doin life
300 pounds says youre his wife
Walks in your cell and says Fix it up
Then you look up and say Not the butt
He says Shut up But but No but
Now what you gonna do freakydeaky or what
The money was good the money was fast
No business mind and the money wont last
In the money rate you fell first to last
Now every night you fight for your ass
They say what goes up must come down
All hustlers know that sound
Cause youre here today gone the next
And youll find out the hard way you get no respect
Man you must be crazy and bugged
Whatcha mean I dont get no respect
You crazy
You got to respect me
Cause I was the first millionaire off the streets boy
Aint nobody ever had a hustle like mine
In 72 I was killin em boy
Man go head go head
Im tellin ya I was shittin on it
Word up I was the man
And a car these niggas aint got no cars today man
My car was so pretty I ride by niggas dicks get hard

Caddy boy Grand Daddy Caddy
They used to call me Mackaroni Tony boy
Aw man go head shut yo broke ass up man
Word I spell it out Ill yell it out
For those brothers that keep sellin out
Cause local clout is all youre about
A few bullshit bitches and hanging out
And every days like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
Id like to know what youre thinkin about
It sure aint dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before its too late
Or theyll be doing your makeup down at the coroners place
And you will have lived just to die
And youll die with no respect
Yo man what about hoes what about hoes
Hoes
Shit man I had mo bitches than muthafuckin Coned got switches boy
I had hoes loads of hoes you know what Im sayin
Hoes hoes you dig

Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
You made a lot of money since you hit the stage
Swingin on the pole so many different ways
Got hit with a butt cheek and smacked ya back
Youre a dancer but you shoulda been a acrobat
I dont even know if its bald or bushy
I see them titties out girl but I aint saw no pussy
What we gotta do to see you get butt naked
And shake it how much you tryin to make bitch
You could do it easily is this how you gon do me

Take them panties off and let that pussy hang

You know you cant win hangin with your scary ass friends
Flossin at the club but you never had a Benz
Now these bitches wanna hurt you
They say you act gay you probably wear skirts too
Thats what they say they callin you a faggot
It might be a problem you better call some backup
Fuck a credit card cant go to Western Union
Use the ATM or just keep it movin
Aint nobody chasin you not if you aint runnin
But if you in this club man you gotta spend some money
He dont wanna buy a dance but he cant stop lookin
Nigga ducked and he ran out the club and he shook him beotch

3645,"War in the Mind Freedom Time Lyrics
Everybody knows that they guilty
Everybody knows that theyve lied
Everybody knows that they guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Time to get free or give yourselves up now
Its freedom said its freedom time
Yo theres a war in the mind over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms keepin us in forms of religion
Conformin our vision
To the world churchs decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin our tape recorders
From hearin like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
Whats got em drunk off the spirits
Truth comes we cant hear it
When youve been programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin in indescision
Apallin callin religious
Some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of AntiChrist the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion
Now who you choosin
The head or the tail
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the tale
Conferences is Yale
Discussin doctrines of Baal
Causin people to fail
Keepin the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin desperation to get the best of me
Punishment til there was nothing left of me
Realizin the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine supernatural circumcision
Inwardly only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity shapen in
Theres no escapin when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a mans heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow makin love with a whore
Achin in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where theres no repentance there can be no admission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
Whats goin on whats a priority to you
By what authority do to you
The majority hasnt a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned let them with ears understand
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Its freedom Imma be who I am
Its freedom time said its freedom time
Everybody knows that theyve lied
Everybody knows that theyve perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they guilty yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Get free be who youre supposed to be
Freedom said its freedom time now
Freedom said its freedom time
Freedom freedom time now

2929,"Me and my bitch took a little trip
Down to the garden took a little dip Oh no 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Lil sip took a lil sip
Took a lil sip ttook a lil took a lil took a lil sip
Ayo I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold techs like they mad at the ref
Thats why I keep a cross on my chest either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit watch for the Adams apple
Slick with words dont hate me son
What you eat dont make me shit and who you fuck dont make me cum
Put a price on my head wont make me run
Try to kill me but it cant be done
Cause my words gon live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Me and my bitch took a little trip
Down to the garden took a little dip Oh no 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Bitches come and go You know that 
Money come and go You know that 
Love come and go Dont shit last 
Bitches come and go You know that 
Money come and go You know that 
Love come and go Dont shit last 
Take a seat baby girl youve been all in my mind
I know I aint called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5 no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy aint shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And thats why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin like Harlem in the nineseven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making As at 11
Or 12 trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell only time gon tell
Fuck her while her mama home baby dont yell
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader fuck your magazine hater
When I say that Im the greatest I aint talking about later
Ima drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wany
And I dont mean no disrespect I praise legends
But this whats next the boy sick cant disinfect
Lifes a bitch and her pussys wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of death
Blaow
Me and my bitch took a little trip
Down to the garden took a little dip Oh no 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Bitches come and go You know that 
Money come and go You know that 
Love come and go Dont shit last 
Bitches come and go You know that 
Money come and go You know that 
Love come and go Dont shit last 
Dont shit last dont shit last and you know that
Went to hell got hot didnt melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife QTip Ali and Jarobi

Ratin laten and perpetratin
My albums NINE mics tough like dirt bikes
You get frantic New York City run and panic
California I switch up boogie on ya
Like Don Cornelius on SOULLLLLLLLLLL TRAIN
And heads I clip off in rap leave a bloodstain
A bigger pain you would need novacaine
Bite off Rakim you copy Big Daddy Kane
You know my steelo I rhyme against a million people
Who think they equal disguisin as Jamaican people
Fakin funkin youre pedigree your beat is sunk in
Tonka toy of little boy steppin down to Roy
Im no joke I rap for cash and youre buyin a coat
Bronx bomber superb on the freak momma
Stinkin movin my whole crew is comin through

Packed with speed supersonic level read
Steelo jets and Bill Blass like rockets
In your pockets damagin your brain sockets

Chorus
Like Mobile settin up shop in Alabama
For proper grammar my style Arm Hammer
Strong computer underground like Roto Rooter
Fools critics they mimic copy sloppy
MCs get hurt you blockhead try to stop me
Digital thinkin youre blinkin career sinkin
Old like Mod Squad you rap like Lincoln
Sideburns turned you catchin ringworm
A heavy virus worser than hepatitis
Schizophrenic like ten people out the clinic
Yankee Stadium uptown you cant win the pennant
I do construction you pack up your whole production
Your lips are ready your girl has a nice suction
Pack her bags pack her bags pack her bags right
Pack her bags pack her bags pack her bags left

And yall wasnt wearing gold watches
Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch

And oh lawnmower just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces man
And deliver it to your front door

Got your girl ass clapping hands down
Dont approach me with your hands out
Sittin down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
Its me and Im cool with it
You dont know what to do with yourself
When I do it Im doing it fresh
Born to do it so I do it to death
Calm in the steps walking my dawgs
We dont get along Im tellin em fetch
Hit em like PA Hit em like PA
Shoot up the spot and Im leavin like Ah
Okay you know I started from scratch

2297,"Dis nigga like hes so exclusive
Sometimes dreams peace of paper I got reams
Where the D go Put that on a rose now you
Pronounce it hero you see
Lu see like La Brea Pico with binoculars on my peephole
I feel my best work was album zero
Now with Deniro its boo boo in my backyard and
Ben burnt down my gazebo that dineros a casino
Wit spit in the sandwich of the police though
They aint see the steel plate up under my seat though
Still play it like Shaquille but I can free throw
I aint playing but I compete I aint a player but Im complete
And thats the win win a mason mind cant sign if the pens Templar
Night vision on white linen is still green
Peace of Paper I got reams make it rain
To make em smile now rake it into piles
And go buy ya self some style prom nightcat walk
Prepared the suit for weeks or effortless as a Parisian
Walking down the street I aint in it
Im just walking round some beats
Tongue in cheek just talking round some teeth
Neighborhood watching
Made of good options mastermind times
Neighborhood hoodie take the hood shopping
Back track to the stolen plates
Whats a closed wallet to an open safe
Say your grace
Peace of PaperCup of Jayzus what we writing
These aint entendres these are secret indictments
Litte secret excitements
For willing minds Im feeling fine
Balling hard and killing rhymes
Knocking off bigs and stealing shines
Hey shawty is it a crime
To DMV everytime until I give em license
They waiting on lines
Peace of Paper Im Kerry James
Commissions fly as the Constitution as a plane
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what we doing
Pizza Lasers Cup of Razors
What you choosing
Choosy mothers choose the smoothest peanut butters
And more cognizant fathers do George Washington Carver
A break from the paper it means do you identify more
With whats being made or the maker
Im whats being chased
Im not the chaser
Cup of JAYZUS Peace of Paper
Check it now paper make a plane paper make it rain
But how fly is paper plane in the rain
Im fly paper on the brain
This and twoply paper just aint the same
I do do it for the bottom
In the air is where I stop em
I threw words like 2 birds thats Batman and Robin
To answer all your hunches thats just how I throw my punches
We must somehow become a family thats why I throw em in bunches
Mushroom clouds or on the flo with the fungus
If you look em up and down
From the foot to where he put his crown
The slow Pan to understand is Shaq on the shoulders of Yao
Over and over for miles
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS made a movie
Thank God on Friday then buy a ruby on Tuesday
A couple beats from Jay a couple beats from Ye
make Food for thought thats a restaurant in a day
It would behoove thee
The critics say that I fell off I acknowledge I slipped
But what do you call falling from space into a bottomless pit
And not pit like how Lui Kang can knock Baraka off with a hit
Knock it off for a bit
What would be really funny if I blew up after Drizzy
And started from the bottomless back to the topless like a watcher of Strips
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS bout it bout it
Dont let ya inner fears result in a outer coward
From baby showers to 80 flowers upon my coffin roof
The upper class glass is not filled up with the coughing proof
Be more P and step ya Yessirs Up
POP Jayzus a cup of Courage I cant cant
Thats double negative its 2 earls
They really nice but theyll never touch the cup its like I gave it to two girls
This my odd future out in front Supreme shop
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop
Thought Kick Push was about drugs
Its not but just to be super sure
But from your perspective it might seem
Like Supreme out in front of Odd Future Store
So that skaters and skiers
Nose grinders and grinding up
Nose powders with ether
Not an Earl diss either but he might think it be and be like
Lus new should be MrPure 2positive Shakur and 2 be sure hes
Not that really nice That 2 girls and cup line sucked
It really means he gave himself a cup twice
You just witnessed a double a probable Odd Future diss in the future
And me ghostwriting my own rebuttals
You cant do that with a single cup
You gone need a couple again you got a double
Got my shot on the rocks but dont stop keep pouring til its a puddle
Peace of Paper Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS whats the drive
Greatest Rapper Alive or Greatest Rapper That Died
Then on judgement day they say the greatest rappers revived
Oh look whos here the greatest rappers arrived
At the birthday party the greatest rapper surprised
Bumped into Doom the greatest rappers collide
Everybody dead but AZ the greatest rapper survived
Im not the greatest rapper the greatest rappers a lie
Got the same points as Lux the greatest rappers a tie
Told Jean Foxy Rah the greatest rappers a girl
They said the greatest rappers a guy
Phone rang it was Ghost he said Kiss the greatest rapper Goodbye
Chris said Common Common said Kweli Talib said Im sure its Mos Definitely
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS
Smack might have the greatest but now Im just playing favorites
Playing flavored to be reminiscent of Miles on smack playing faded
Peace of these niggas is nice
Knees like these niggas aight
Shins like listen to them ankles like shins making sense
Feet like why you running behind these niggas
They still trying to step inside ya prints
Bear trap rap dont step inside the clinch
Where da at Dont jeopardize a better stride for limps
I exercise at length so electrify the fence
Let me inside the danger room on level 5 with the weaponized defense
With an extra side of the next guys petty exercise attempts
The ghost of my career better than most of what they revere
I take my targets and throw them back on my spear
Im outta here
Drogas
Shaka Zulu

If you seen your best friend stiff you would cry too
Sometimes I dont even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin brother
I wanna know 
Who killed G man too The shit I seen men do
If I told you Id have me floating in some cement shoes
See Compton aint shit really
And Ive been at the bottom of the pits feel me
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac Im like birdie at the troops
I cant lie every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I dont know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak

I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest its kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one the homies never came to see me
Suspect two Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldnt see me
Theres usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night Im like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
Im cool with taking mine but I took other niggas gunshots
Chest wide open Im tryna fight but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me cause I shot them
But who set me up I aint tripping but
I wanna know 
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie
I wanna know names

92,"Now when I say 20 you say
Nah you know the rest
This is our scene
Our music our movement the history lives through us
I write to the beat and let life play the guitar strings
Despite the drama theres respect and camaraderie
Every time one of my friends is mentioned in My Philosophy
Its a rite of passage Im not trying to be corny
I got love for Sportn Life Alpha P Massline and Onry
Every time somebody steps out on the road
They bring a little Northwest soul with them amen
Alright then just so you know
I try to carry that every time that I rock a show
So turn my sound up
Ricochet off our mountain
Its Good Medicine that Chief Sealth wouldve been proud of
Sends our city town pride heart blood sweat tears I5
North South side vibe live ride down these city blocks
And never will be stopped
They tryin to shut down the clubs that my city rocks
Now Mr Mayor why would you enforce an ordinance
Music it saves lives these kids out here are supporting it
And through the art form weve learned the importance of community
Truth to the youth so they know whats up
Yup and as a public school student
I learned from my teachers but became through my music
Take that away thats a vital
14 Fathoms Deep Do the Math Tribal
My greatest teachers BSelf and Vita
Wordsayer was my mayor and things have changed
But I carry the torch and what I do with that flame
Is lit every time that I step on the stage
The skyline is etched in my veins
You can never put that out no matter how hard it rains
Northwest making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do coming to my side
I mean I like how yall do
Thank you but we onto new
Put it down for the town with music
Making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do coming to my side
When my peeps know my crew bring the flame
Put it down for the town
Wearing that Seattle blue
Thats right when you put on a show
And watch the people seat in between the creases and the doors
Hitting up Meli or sneaking in cause theyre broke
Not leaving in between sets because of needing to smoke
The reason being whatever
The scene from Beacon to Everett
Is in need of less ego when we kick it alright
I get on stage style share my whole life
Try to reach em at the bar where theyre drinking Miller Lite
But the kids in the front they bring out the passion dude
Make noise throughout the show and not only when we ask em to
I watch the older cats jaded in the back
Hands clasped forgot when they werent too cool to be a fan damn
Hatin at the concert
You dont remember RKCNDY watching Heiro or vibing out to Alkaholiks
I know its not the same it never will be
But my my my my citys filthy
And weve been truly dope
Since Supreme was up on Broadway in the dookie rope
Mean muggin in Sir Mixalots video
Back when Scene was rockin house parties on the floor
JMGs Sit N Spin and The Paradox
Back when Marc introduced Geo to Sabz
So much has changed here so much has not
I was just a kid hopin I could earn my spot
Try to get some props
Meet a promoter wholl give me a shot
To let me get up on stage and get the crowd to rock
Read a page out my notebook
What I thought would be respected they would connect with it
Now looking over the citys the only thing that keeps me calm
Scattered thoughts jotted down by this pen in my palm

2164,"Midnight chillin at AM PM
Coolin drinkin apple juice
In Evils BM
The sounds up loud
To attract attention
Armor Alled tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin
Bumpin Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin
I was ridin shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin bout Get out
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool thru his fuckin mouth
Why would they step
When they know were strapped
I never cruise LA
Without a gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caught the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the car door
Thats where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin bad
The car seats were turnin red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadnt yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Take you on a walk through hell
South Central
Yo E drive drive drive man drive fuck it lets get the fuck outta here man
We boned down Vernon
Made a right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin through the ETGs
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
E where we goin
He didnt even answer that
Checked the rear view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from
What made these brothers come
Bang Our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didnt come to play
Bust a right turn parked
And then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched
Three of us bleedin
It was ten past midnight
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Midnight time for a homicide
South Central
Come on man yall bleeding bad man you gotta keep up man we cant stop here
I really didnt like
How this shit was goin down
Wrong night wrong time
Wrong fuckin part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoovers hood
Three niggas bleedin
That shit dont look good
See over there red dont go
Some places reds all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Broke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin crazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin worse
And Evil was gettin dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket but fuck it it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Take you on a walk through hell
South Central
Yall just lay down on the floor of this car fuck the police man imma handle this
When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I waited till they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked em up I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear yo Im outty yall
Dont know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers the cops
Dumped the GTA
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evils car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin bout my allnight death bout
Then somethin woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin police
When theyre tryin to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch
It was six in the mornin
",you gotta keep up man we cant stop here I really didnt like How this shit was goin down Wrong night wrong time Wrong fuckin part of town Ya see we was deep In the Hoovers hood Three niggas bleedin That shit dont look good See over there red dont go Some places reds all they know But not our luck Tonight we was real fucked Broke down an alley And we instantly had to duck Fuckin police on a gang sweep No time to deal with one time So we had to creep Broke through a back yard Ran through a vacant lot E Hen and Don kept up To be some niggas shot Shit was gettin crazy So I had to get busy Hen was bleedin worse And Evil was gettin dizzy Looked in a parking lot I needed a snatch bar Had to hot wire So I moved on an old car It was a bucket but fuck it it had to do Started it up And scooped my whole crew Two blocks later We saw fuckin blue lights The pigs were behind us It was half past midnight Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang Take you on a walk through hell South Central Yall just lay down on the floor of this car fuck the police man imma handle this When they pulled us over Shit got worse I waited till they got out And then I hit reverse Fucked em up I seen one cop fall Threw it in gear yo Im outty yall Dont know how But somehow we got away Lost the jackers the cops Dumped the GTA Made it back to the hood Fixed the crew up And even though Evils car blew up We made it home and then I crashed out Thinkin bout my allnight death bout Then somethin woke me up From my dark sleep The sound of fuckin police When theyre tryin to creep Broke through my door With no goddamn warning Looked at my watch It was six in the mornin,Midnight chillin at AM PM Coolin drinkin apple juice In Evils BM The sounds up loud To attract attention Armor Alled tires On a lowered suspension Nardi to steer with Alpine deck was glowin Bumpin Big Daddy And the nigga was definitely flowin I was ridin shotgun Donald and Hen in back Look through the tint recognized a jack Two brothers strolled up Talkin bout Get out Donald D blazed Shot one fool thru his fuckin mouth Why would they step When they know were strapped I never cruise LA Without a gat in my lap The other fool shot Caught the E in the shoulder blade I busted through the car door Thats where the nigga laid Hen jumped out Dropped two nines in his forehead Evil was bleedin bad The car seats were turnin red Looked to my left There were two more carloads Niggas in hats and hoods In an attack mode And they hadnt yet begun to fight E hit the gas It was one past midnight Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang Take you on a walk through hell South Central Yo E drive drive drive man drive fuck it lets get the fuck outta here man We boned down Vernon Made a right on Normandie Left on Florence Gettin through the ETGs Spun out on Vermont Made a left on Colden Right on Hoover E where we goin He didnt even answer that Checked the rear view They were still out back Where were these brothers from What made these brothers come Bang Our back window Was removed by a shotgun Now Hen G was shot Don caught a ricochet These motherfuckers was ill They didnt come to play Bust a right turn parked And then we got left Hid in the the bushes Shot the gas tank to fake death But would this really Keep them psyched Three of us bleedin It was ten past midnight Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang Midnight time for a homicide South Central Come on man yall bleeding bad man

Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth

ICE T fool man of my own fullgrown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone

Layin it sayin it then youre playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin it
Hated by many but I hateem back
Loved by troopers who know where its at
You might like me might think Im wack
But dont step to me cause the boy stays strapped
Im taking no shorts hatin the courts hatin the judges
Punk DAs with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats no jeans no sneakers no what
No beepers no gold Yo kiss my ass
Well wait and see who gets the last laugh
Well have the power
Power x3 
Power it starts with P like pussy
She knows shes got it she doesnt worry does she
Spendin your cash leavin you in the trash
While your little heads thinkin theyre gone in a dash
They got it know it thats why they show it
The power of sex if man could overthrow it
Hed be king in a day no way
We get rich hard give it away
Were weak and as we speak the girls are hawkin
Sizin me up straight out as Im talkin
You gotta have control if you want the gold
I dont wanna be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin bout the green
And stop dwellin on the inbetween
I got the power
Power
Im on a mission mackin hard as a hammer
Take my picture I might take your camera
My posse might move and they move fast
A fools move could be a punks last
Aint no criminal although I used to be
Aint no new jack rappin aint new to me
I been makin records on wax since 1982
Now its 1988 finally Im coming through
That adds up to six years of makin ok jams but now Im mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin out concerts housin the industry
Lovin all the fly girls screamin for ICE T
Rollin with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 Solid gold my medallion
Gainin velocity momentum and energy
ICE Capital T

So you say that Im a fake think you really must be a fool
I been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at shot back hit and seen my buddies killed
Thats the foundation upon the raps of IceT are built
I say what I think the system does stink
Money you walk you short youre writin from the clink
Come on whats up you know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame release those with pull
Power I know you wanna try it
Well check out money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin
The knowledge of power is mine so just listen
Money controls the world and thats it
And once you got it then you can talk shit

2951,"Brothers and sisters and friends and I see some enemies
Laughter and then applause
In fact I think wed be fooling ourselves
If we had an audience this large and didnt realize
That there were some enemies present
Im a weapon that fires lyrical projectiles
With no mercy Im coldblooded like reptiles
Touch a pregnant bitch and make her give birth to a dead child
Every time I flex styles
Niggas vacate the premises and become exiles
I manufacture rhymes like textiles of xfiles
Enlighten juveniles livin life with no purpose
Organize an army that will make the devils nervous
Competition is worthless like the electoral vote
If you provoke Ill break your motherfuckin neck in a yoke
Your better off throwin your shitty life away sniffin coke
Technique will choke you into a spiritual state
And it will take a lake of hydrochloric acid to soften this
Ill fake your parents suicide and kill you in the orphanage
But I inspire ideological metamorphosis
Stop talkin shit or Ill make your existence a memory
So you can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
But Ill break the ice if anyone on the planet mentions me
Ill burn a hypocritical flag intentionally
Explosive revolutionary chemistrys my destiny
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
When I fight you I wont snipe you
Ill use a HIVinfected needle to strike you
As well as anyone that vaguely resembles or looks like you
And just to spite you Ill force your children
At gun point to bite you and rip a piece off
To start the beef off of the rest of your petty limited life
Im comin atcha to catch ya by surprise in the cyph
Nobodys stupid enough to back ya when I tactically attack ya
Because my style is nasty like protruding bone fractures
And youre a playedout dirty pussy devil like Margaret Thatcher but Technique never get captured inside the rapture
Cause I mastered the art of causin natural disasters
You should learn the difference
In between the students and the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damagin decibels
Even though my starvin people are considered expendable
I consecutively escape the racist corporate tentacles
I spit raw kinetic energy thats immeasurable
Retaliation for perpetration is unendable
Mercy is not extendible
Ill break your fuckin brain down into psychological chemicals
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy

3365,"Hustler Puppet Street Lyrics
This here is cocaine city
Got four dames with me in the slow lane
Coupe Deville so hard
They told me they want to sniff some unemployment lines
I gave them equal opportunity blow jobs
Menace to society
Drink a flask of Bacardi fast crash claim sobriety
Still pass a polygraph
Nina in my right hand her cousins on the night stand
I aint never work a day in my life for the white man
I am the most imaginative pimp
Slick sentences diatribes defenseless
When soliloquies set in its like cyanide
Lord I have tried to learn these hoes
But they are hard headed so god please let it be known
That Im a hustler
Im glad we could make it out
Youre so cool
Youre so cool
And it hurts now
Kleptomaniac they used to call me Lefty
Poppa was a rolling stone the streets is all he left me
So now its better when I jettison
Jet set jet ski cool out
You know man kick back Jet Li
I even use to sta sta sta sta stutter when I talk
But now the cops know that I bop with a ca ca cane
When I be walking up the block
The way they jock my whip I call it Secretariat
Various horses inside my stable its hilarious
Scavengers live vicariously thru the hustler pimp
And bottom feed SKRIMPS 
No woman is exempt I hustle so that I can see weed
Scrilla deceased commanders and chiefs seaweed
Liberal I do not discriminate with customers
Its the shit you couldnt sniff if you was Mr Snuffleupagus
Stay after that green bitch Captain Kirk muscle up
Or eat a knuckle sandwich cause I will never struggle
Im a Hustler

3274,"Fill my lungs up pour my heart out peel my bones away
Crack my window shed my shadow excavate my pain
If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what Ive written
Tryna get closer to spirit that enters the body
Its the vessel like Im not in it
In fiftysomething years I wont be here
Therell be a kid with some headphones coverin his ears
Walkin round a hallway dreamin of ideas
Find himself in the sound cause music is a mirror
What you looking for What you headed towards
Whats your name worth when they mention yours
When you leave here are you stepping forward
Can you remember your intention when they question yours
Theyre gonna question yours theyre gonna question yours
Ive been to rock bottom and Im headed North
If you dont love yourself whats the respect for
If you dont love life the check wont correct yours
Excavate
Fill my lungs up pour my heart out peel my bones away
Crack my window shed my shadow excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace
I had this vision of my death
Surrounded by people I love and respect
In the baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pullin me round the block that I rep
The greatest fear that Ive ever kept
Is dying with regrets
Like was I just alive for success
Or did I leave a better life for the rest
My greatest achievement isnt the dollars
My greatest achievement isnt the followers
My greatest achievement isnt the accolades
My greatest achievement is my daughter
Wakin up in the morning bein a father
Watchin the light kiss her eyelids
Hearin her sing along to Chance
And bein like Yeah thats my kid
The light started to glow
And the saxophone from Coltrane started to blow
Tender laying in the snow turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road
Excavate
Fill my lungs up pour my heart out peel my bones away
Crack my window shed my shadow excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
Im an open book no I dont mind but sometimes Im hard to read
Just flesh and bone Im headed home but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobodys watching me
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
Im an open book no I dont mind but sometimes Im hard to read
Just flesh and bone Im headed home but this life is so hard to leave

971,"Look
I let the beat bang I dont claim colors
Honestly the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when its winter time
Im still waitin on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then its adios Killa 
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the moneys grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the moneys blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
Ill never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when Im not functioning in tiptop shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy
Uh
Im tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Im a muhfuckin killa killa killa killa
Uh
And Im the one to blame
Now that Im around shit will never be the same
Im a killa killa killa killa nigga
Listen look
Before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones that yall said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and youll see what Im bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammas out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bump you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped em out
I go for mine like its overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
Cause on a mission your worst enemy is idle time
Hussle
Im tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Im a muhfuckin killa killa killa killa
Uh
And Im the one to blame

Some of you niggas need to quit
Show and tell nigga you aint shit

Short afros and jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald head and say go to hell
But your a snake your a worm
Bald head bitch you need a perm
Oakland california is the city of liars
Fresh barbed wires with vouge tires
Niggas tellin stories twenty minutes long
And everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I dont wanna know
All I want is stereo rock
Homeboys kick it gettin keyed
Sold that mark some fake weed
Told that nigga here you go
A big fat sack and you know its premo
A 20dollar bill went to your hand
You rushed that money to the coke man
To the coke bottle was the next stop
But you broke the bottle and cant smoke rock
Base rocks base rocks thats your daddy
You better off smokin on a powdered cabby
Have a white christmas everyday
Cause cocaine cabby is a too short way
Thats Too SHORT
Smoke more coke than Richard P
Have more money than Michael Jackson
Oakland can I get some action
Hey young tender in the 501s
I love to see when you work your tongue
Suckin my dick in the back of the car
Rollin down Skyline boulavard
I said beeeeeeeyach
What are you smoking
A big fat dick in the big East Oakland
I see my homie he needs to quit
Holdin hands with a bitch who looks like shit
Maybe Im wrong by what I say
Maybe that nigga is gettin paid
Maybe that nigga aint bein used
Gettin fucked without collectin dues
Thats how I work all the time
Im Too Short baby got a fresh new rhyme
For Oakland California thats the place
Homies got drugs all in yo face
When the OPD cruise down again
Niggas goin half off dubes and tens
On any corner anywhere
Buy your drugs from a Oakland player
Niggas sell squat callin it top
Cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
Crime went down murder went up
And some of these turfs are tryin to get tuff
Whos the leader of the hour
Anybody livin if they push power
M16 357
Sendin these niggas to hell not heaven
So much death in the Oakland streets
Your nothin but a target sellin weed
You know Im rappin the honest truth
Niggas roll up shootin guns at you
Threatening your life and calling you fake
Till you take your drugs to another state
And sometimes man its a pity
Cause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city
Niggas who take do you know yourself
You must be the nigga with all the wealth
Maybe one day you can own this town
If everybody fucked and you are down
Thats how you see it I do too
But I break bitches and you break crews
Oakland California is gettin tough
Niggas got schemes for coming up
Niggas got ways to make big bank
Hittin these streets like an army tank
Im Too SHORT
Spitin more game than youll ever speak
music for 10 seconds 
I got more bitches wantin me
Cause Im the best dam rapper from the Oakland streets
Im the coldest MC on a microphone
Oakland California wont leave it alone
Cause Im on this mic rapping that game
Knockin off tapes like Im selling cocaine
Fucking these freaks indefinitely
I never stop fucking you Oakland freaks
High school bitches really like
The way Sir Too Short can rock the mic
Oakland California thats the place
Freak freak bitch got a lot of ways
She got big fat titties size 38
Imma fuck that bitch but I cant wait
The young girl makes my body boil
When I fuck that bitch imma drill for oil
Imma put cocaine all over my dick
And tell that bitch its time to lick
East Oakland thats where I live
The city of the freak freak freaky bitch
I spent the night with her she aint mine
I fuck that bitch so many times
And that right there I could never fake
I thought my goddamn dick would break
Fucking too much makes you hurt
But I never stuck a bitch from puttin in work
All you bitches can suck me dry
Suckin my dick for the rest of your lives
Ok baby here we are
Were just two young freaks in the back of the car
You are one whos the other

Hot damn ho here we go again
Suckers steal a beat when you know they cant win
You stole the beatare you having fun
Now me and the Auds gonna show you how its done
You are what I label as a nerver plucker
Youre plucking my nerves you MC sucker
I thought I oughta tell you better yet warn
That I am like a stock and my word is bond
Like James killing everybody in sight
The codes threesix the name is Lyte
After this jam I really dont give a damn
Cause Imma run and tell your whole damn clan
That youre a

Thirty days a month your mood is rude
We know the cause of your bloody attitude
Beat biter dope style taker
Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker
Beat biter dope style taker
Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker
Your style is smooth even for a cheating mic
You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim soundalike
Heres a Milkbone a sign of recognition
Dont turn away I think you should listen close
Dont boast you said you wasnt bragging
You fucking liar youre chasin a chuckwagon
The only way you learn you have to be taught
That if a beat is not for sale then it cant be bought
When you leave the mic you claim its smoking
Unlike Rakim you are a joke
And I think you ought to stop before you get in too deep
Cause with a sister like Lyte yo I dont sleep

When Im in a jam with my homegirl Jill
My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls
So I step in the middle shake it just a little
Wait for some female to step up and pop junk
Give my cousin a cue treat the girl like a punk
Now Im not trying to say that Im into static
But yo if you cause it yep we gotta have it
Cause I aint going out like a sucker no way
So I sit around the way for you to make my day
We can go for the hands better yet for the words
Cause youll be ignored and at the same time Ill be heard
Throughout the city the town and the country
The beat is funky my rhyme is spunky
There is no delaying in the rhyme Im saying
Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing
So sit back Jack and listen to this its 10 dis
Cause Im just about ready to fly this fist against your lips
But Ill wait for the day or night that you approach
And Imma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast
Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble
Your skin just crumble a battles no trouble
Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid
This thing called hiphop Lyte is ruling it
I hate to laugh in your face but youre funny
Your beat your rhyming your timing all crummy
On the topic of rapping I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet
Your rap is weak homegirl and its definitely crooked
Others write your rhymes while I write my own
I dont create a character when Im on the microphone
I am myself no games to be played
No script to be written no scene to be made
I am the director as far as you are concerned
You dont believe me then youll have to learn
This aint as hard as MC Lyte can get
Matter of fact you aint seen nothing yet
So never let me step into a party hardy
Talk to some people and then hear from somebody
You wanna battle cause you know where I am
You dont wanna come in the 90s and see me at a jam
When a mic is handy ten feet away
I stretch my arm like elastic hand like a magnet
Set assure you know I dont play
When it comes down to it the nitty gritty
For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity

Cynically Sierra Leonian fresh to death
Big homie and them reps the best
Knew you know me from somewhere
I get wrecked with Questlover
The brother get it on bring a song
More brutal than Genghis Khan
Whose name ring alarms to fakes
You couldnt place but know Im the truth
Thats before you recognize its the one from the Roots
Armed to the tooth trying to take a eye for another eye
Im from We hear gunfire for a lullaby
Yo forget it who the hell am I
Yo Im the reason these MCs lies became nullified
The stuff of legend so tell me whats tougher brethren
When Im the blast from the past that started the present
Vision of the future me and the super producer
And Im ten times smart as Im used to be
And Im still seeing the voice through the speakers
Porsche two seaters Jimmy Choo speakers
Real rap remedy man a true genius
I brought Yosemite Sam two heaters
Asking these bastards if its any last words
Besides what when why and all them adverbs
You bout to be the next fugitive captured
Just keep thinking you can lie and live after
Slow your roll playboy rabbit ears
Cuz damn right its on sight like Vladimir
And by the moment in time you will be outta there
Strapped getting slapped for acting so cavalier
I come from Philly and them cowards dont travel there
Brothers let the heat rattle there they dont battle there
Itching to leave you in a pool like Mike Phelps
Learning to fight might help but thats light help
Because if bullets make flack melt
Then imagine just what itd do to you even if you a black belt
Ayo my brother still concealing with a Gat held
On a block where it used to be a lot of crack dealt
Lo and behold this is information overload
I put the crowd in a trance like Paul Oakenfold
I used to be the lowest on the totem pole
Until I reconstructed my goals left a broken mold
Setting sights on a open road
I hit up anywhere and everywhere
That realness is bought and sold
Ayo they got me on an honor roll
That means whenever speaking my name
Begin that with The Honorable
TAR one I like a monocle
I bring the riot through and laugh cuz youre comical
Look get in that ass like your father do
Hit that catatonic chronic out in Bonnaroo
Im psychological jump like Geronimo
Probably get yourself knocked down like a domino
Whoa if I dont work then I wont eat
No I dont Facebook but I might Tweet
The industry is out of control like OC
So take this L on the chin like its a goatee
Im kinda like a cellar door Im lowkey
I used to mix bottles of Champale with OE
Im Aristotle I cant fail Im OG
I came through to get free like no fee
Hey yo they got me on a pedestal trophy
Got em singing damn Riq cheating like adultery
Sycamore sitting on paper like upholstery
Noam Chomsky Im on an organized rhyme spree
Messing with this is a borderline robbery
And thats what it is Im Jimbrowski
Certain circles call me The Big Lebowski
It would behoove you to find out about me

This is IceT talkin to you boy
Imma tell you what time it is
Yo its time for me to pump the volume
No problem the records revolvin
Evils the mixer Im the rap trickster
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice coolin yo colder than ever
Punk executioner E pull the lever
Rotate the wax then cut an axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Dont try to size up you better wise up
To the rap criminals were succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics no beepers needed
For this drug deal Im the big wheel
The dope Im sellin you dont smoke you feel
Out on the dance floor on my world tour
Im sellin dope in each and every record store
Im the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end

Kickin on the Boulevard my tempos hyped and hard
I dont ask the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out with Warner Bros clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut then removes it
IZ checks for purity then approves it
And then you get it try it and like it
And if it aint potent we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope not a noose in a rope
Because if youre doin crack youre on death row
Youre just a toy punk to mess with that junk
You want some real dope come look in my trunk
The dope Im sellin is life 100 legit

1989,"Bitch I aint got nothing but time
So Imma get out on these cuts and grind
Keep my mind on cloud twentynine
My player ways keep me with plenty dimes
See Ima shine like all six of my gold teeth Yeah 
When a nigga get through cooking up this OZ Yeah 
All night on the block til the sun rise Yeah 
My only friend is a Glock with the fourfive
Four five in the mornin it dont stop
Daydreamin bout flossin a droptop
Woop Blue lights snap me back to reality Ugh 
I hit the alley quick and toss what I got on me
Tricks aint got shit to do but harass
Searched a nigga and took about a three in cash
I guess thats better than gettin locked up
Or gettin jammed with that shit I had rocked up huh
Now I heard that the South is where yo folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back way back
And now they wonder why we act how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card
If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
I got a maid cooking grits with a outfit so tight
My niggas wanna stay the whole night
Dice game in the kitchen nigga T Lee
Nigga drunk singin sounding like the Bee Gees
Ham sammich in the driveway droptop
Naked women in the den playing hopscotch
Thirty busters in my yard they be long gone
So hit me and Imma keep my phone on
I be out turning corners drinking one fifth
Got some scratches on my rims cause of one dip
Met a broad yesterday she hit me ten times
If I diss her itll take a nigga ten lines
MJG standing tall and I wont fold
You can have all the bitches cause I dont hold
Onto any woman like a human handcuff
You got your hair down baby fuck it stand up
Now I heard that the South is where yo folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back way back
And now they wonder why we act how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys and talking slow

If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
If anybody out there hear me get your hands up

How many flows can I compose I drop this slang like lyrical bows
Stickin out just like an outcast or a thorn from stem of rose
Like nachos the lyrics are crispy crackin when yall bite Bite 
Been had a Coke and a smile now Im trippin off gnac Sprite
Yall just might see the skunk guy with a girl who chunkedthighed
Below the MasonDixon line real niggas know what Im talkin about
From Texas Atlanta oh man Alabama Savannah
The deeper the darker the Dirty South is what Im after
No laughter the content of the rhyme may be contagious
The Space Age is pimpin this players comin major
They shot the sucker sprayed you cut your wife and played her

Beats rhymes and layers of music right here to please you
And if you hate the Dirty then partne see we dont need you

3041,"Bendin Corners Skee Skert Lyrics
Lil Bonez on the beat
This thing go for sholy
Only bustas I like is Buster Posey
And the Bay is so trashy murkish and murky
Crooked cops crooked dice theyll do you dirty
When I enter the neighborhood when I pull up
People gather round me like an ice cream truck
They say Uncle 40 waterwhats the secret to life
Im trying to get on I need some advice
I give em some game and then I dip
Off to the next episode money to get
Cant be slippin and snoozin and cattin off
If you lag you lose man your loss
My Ruger wont stutter to put you under the cover
Or should I say sheet with a tag on yo feet
Fetti by the face aint complexion as duct tape 
Then its dark like shadows off the tree bad apple
Cognac and Snapple sippin spliffer twistin Swisher Sweets
Smokin and blowin and puffin on some Larry OG
Comin around the corner disrespectfulass beat
Old peep cant sleep call Johnny Law on me
I dont make it rain Im not a cloud
And I dont pay for coochy coochy pay for me pal
You can find me doublefisted in the crowd in the party talkin loud
No harm no foul
And I be bangin this shit when Im bendin that block bendin that block 
Bendin that block
And I be bangin this shit when I bendin that block been in that block

Cracked his shell got on his head
Throw in the towel or we can take it farther
I got more drums than Travis Barker
Or should I say the Blue Men
Two sticks in my hand
I go ape on a fake if thats what he want
Im not a chump Im from Vallejo California I aint no punk
Bboy apparel candy Camaro
Sharp like a arrow hood like valero
Badges be on me they like my strategy
They love my attitude and personality
Crown me like a cavity recognize royalty

296,"Hardcore G shit homie I dont play around
Aint shit sweet bout the peach this Atlanta clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry motherfucker
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all that nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow motherfucker pow Come up off the chain ay ay 
Pow motherfucker pow One off in the brain ay ay 
We some moneyhungry wolves and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard aint shit we strip him like a stripper bitch
These realass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta they aint never speak a pun
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun
And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit
Nigga we aint let that shit go
When you come here you better come correct
This real G shit you gotta show respect
Once upon a time in the projects
An OG saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch said This where little dogs sit
Pointed at the yard yard said Thats where big dogs shit shit 
He said Dont leave til your ass get growed
And dont come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave ave 
Make sure they wanna see ya wanna see ya 
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan Jordan but settle for a Pippen
Player I aint even tripping but I dont really care
Cause my pistols in your face so put your hands in the air
And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit
Nigga we aint let that shit go
When you come here you better come correct
This real G shit you gotta show respect
96 Im riding with a pistol grip banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville Im repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up lets see can they handle this
A hundred round at em that aint no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkkas nightmare trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq Cuba Tel Aviv
Shoot a nigga let him bleed fuck him shorty
Sucka nigga Ill never be dont give a fuck about it
Quick to run up on that Audi make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it he deserve it he allow it
Whats a coward to a kamikaze He aint robbed a man
Aint predator or prey the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K aint no illusion no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you snoozing
And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit
Nigga we aint let that shit go
When you come here you better come correct
This real G shit you gotta show respect
Whadadang whadadadadadang
Listen to my Kimber 45 go bang
Bang bang Grindtime rap gang
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators we eyeballing all of yall lames
Let me fall off Im taking all of yall chains
All of yall watches and all of yall cars
Well who he talking to All of yall stars
All of yall rappers and producers and such
No homo promo homie you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa 83 you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners then you rolling with us
I know some dumb country niggas but them niggas aint me
Know they dress and look the part but them niggas aint G
I dont make dance music this is RAP
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on TV
And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit

2293,"See you with the eye
Rather at the apex of a pyramid or the forehead of a cyclops
Talking shit to me make sure youre off the right block
Still Imma come through in the Mercedes Benz white drop
Might stop but only if I know you I dont mean to blow you with the statement
But I dont be fuckin with these niggas and thats why they be hatin
Cause I stay in the zone I be alone so excuse me if Im wrong
Im off a kush and when the THC affect the dialect I be as free as the wind and fire
Let the energy in me be my empire yet the remedy for me is ultraviolet violence silence
All the critics when I spit it Imma creature of punishment when it comes to torturing
And with this rap shit Im a beast
Balling like Im Uncle Pauly and all of the above we go in the club incognito with the snub
East be the direction that Im prayin in
But Im a Midwest nigga
Mean with a verse something fly I am seen with it first
So they can say Where you get that nigga
The essence of my vocabularys exquisite when I enter into a realm taking me to the helm
Of lyricism you gonna be callin me majesty callin a tragedy that you gotta see on film
So I salute and advise you not to shoot you are not equivalent or parallel to my level
Subpar So coming at me wrong is worse then being on the carousel with the devil
I can turn these happy homes and these fake MCs into whole apartment buildings and vacancies
Bakeries cook em til they done whoop em til they wump put a funk in them niggas
Watch what you say to me
Dont play with me Imma make a hater pray to me
God cause Im hard and my flows is the coldest
You are no threat dont step I am a descendent of Imhotep yes Moses knows this
Of annihilation we are on a brink I be smokin up the stink so before somebody thinks
See how my stylell get ugly as Michael Spinks  when I rap about the Sphinx instead of about minks
Knowledge is power so he taught you bout your third eye
Type of shit I make a bird swim fish fly
Fuck it touch the sky on the first try
Man a motherfucker could never control me only squeeze me and hold me
Is what the fe came up and told me Now is she bold g
But in my mouth is where the gold be cause I be playin her like Goldy
AbSoul I know ya know me
Pack of Backwoods jar of that good yeah I blow it by the OZ
I never sleep you getting cozy
I made it out the jungle I should write a book about Mowgli
I aint a killer but dont push me
I hit you with a Sig but Id rather smoke up on a stogie
God MC you could say Im holy
The ghost of Alori Joh walk with me so a nigga never lonely
Solo Soulo but Top Dawg is a army
Flow AT and T nigga 4 gs
Might be the hip hop Bob Marley Taking shots at politicians while I roll weed
Easily EazyE without the Jheri Curl Juice
Off that drank that make you think every girl cute
On top of the pyramid A angles acute
Mark of the Beast on me him her and you
Money in the safe in case theres a lawsuit
Because any lumberjack would say they saw you
Me and Twista in the cut twistin up a blunt what the fuck you want

In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars
Is there shame when a platinum rappers mother lives in squalor
Mildreds in the Bahamas for the month
Shes probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch
Swordfish my reality is more fish
Banana clips for all you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas
Ha Imagine that where you from nigga
Crutches crosses caskets
Crutches crosses caskets
All I see is death by the masses
The only asterisk is the change of address
My infinity pool as long as Magics
Yeah I let Zillow change my pillows
The home is so inviting the Porsche is the armadillo
The silhouette
The pop pop pop the chop chop chop
The throwaway TECs got TourettesÂ 
Its more than this drug money I love money
I speak to your soul and thats above money
This the ministry of street energyÂ 
The church of criminology teaching my chemistries
Woo Im the L Ron Hubbard of the cupboard
To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it
Crutches crosses caskets
Crutches crosses caskets
All I see is victims

1652,"Get funky with it
I told you before you burn when you play with fire
So take off your hats matter of fact hail the new Sire
Youre hungry as hell so im cookin up the chowder
Its laced with ingredients gon come on like gunpowder
Pompom lick a shot then I got to order
Im runnin for the border for causin disorder
Pompom lick a shot got on my defenses
Im runnin for the fences of course Im relentless
The particular name of this queen is Latifah
Ive often been classified as a feminine teacher
Collectively capture the heart of a nation
Love my culture and show appreciation
Youre lookin for the black influ
I do want to give it to you
What are you mad
Give me some of what you had
You can huffhuff puffpuff and bluffbluff
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff
Ruff and tuff 
And all that stuff 
Now nuff of the ruff stuff thats what I do and I do it well
The proof is in the puddin I show and prove not show and tell
Talk tales you get caught up in a crossfire
Buckshot must be what you want and desire
I write concepts I dont be frontin or be buggin
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin
Its a love thang the Queen doin her thang
If I was a liquid you would drink me like Tang
You think Im kickin things that I myself dont even heed
I rap not for the love of music but for greed
Latifahs booty yo she could never succeed
Shiiit
You watch me do it and boom it the Flavor Unit will snap necks
You afi listen a likkle you fi go buy the cassette
Youre starvin cause you aint had enough
Thats right nuff of the ruff stuff
Ruff and tuff 
And all that stuff 
You talk about flavor
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun n rays
I got flavor for days
Now Im the type that the fellas call a honey and
From me you know you get a run for your money and
This is no meaningless attack I gave you a chance
Matter of fact yo I ordered them to dance
For me they tried to turn me inside out
They felt the wrath of my madness I let them come into my house
Its called Latifahs Law for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule ladies first
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall victim to the evil that men do
Small puff I call your bluff
Im not mad I just had enough of the ruff stuff
Ruff and tuff 
And all that stuff 
Everybody know Latifah love positivity
Now positivity erase negativity
Mi comin inna di dance 
Me rollin with the Flavor Unit posse
As a black woman mi want equality
Equality and di freedom to be me
Mi have a mother Rita only call her Mommy
Likkle brother and sister Angelo and Kelly
A brother in them laws but mi call him Winki
Lost mi daddy and family
black black country
Believe in one God one tribe one destiny
Cease

2252,"Big Dog Status Remix Lyrics
Ho Its young Face slanging yay everyday
Heavyweight got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind nonstop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
Im a true OG you can quote what I say
Im an Htown nigga from around the way
Southside Ridin Dirty like Im UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I dont gangbang I patrol the game
And what Im representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing Ill be old and grey
Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks dog but that aint me
These elbows hit the scene back in eightythree
I stay street when its done thats that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of niggas bitches they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat pussy watch and see
UTP
Ive been straight for a long time
Getting cake for a long time
EJ for a long time
Nigga try to get like this
Ive been a G for a long time
In the street for a long time
Toting heat for a long time
Nigga try to get like this
I got big dog status 8X
Hey Im they fave
They say pressure busts pipes but I aint scared
Its my pleasure to tell it right dont think I aint said
Cause they got prices on my head homie I dont slip
Clips long as giraffe necks thats why I dont trip
Just open up and let it rip aint nothing new to a G
Hey I aint worried about these niggas till they shooting at me
My partner died daughter too give excuses to me
Still a buster ass rapper Im refusing to be
Scarface seem to say Im the king you a fool if you think
Theres another young new rapper dude out there cooler than me Haha 
I cruise in the V brand new with the beat
I live a real life like I say I do in the beat
Yo true indeed I do indeed
Do it for the OGs and the true MCs
Them busters say this year I got brand new and its all phat
Cut that fighting in the club Im done with all that
Nigga ass out of line well his ass getting wet
Give a west side nigga ten stacks thats that
Oh or maybe less as a matter of fact
Nigga be testing the professor whats the matter with cats
Ive been doing this shit nigga who are you
Lil nigga I done seen keys bigger than you
Lil nigga you aint know shit
Cut off a nigga head make him suck his own dick
How the game go Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr Mr Scarface pistols into yall face
Mr Mr Scarface pistols into yall face
Yeah
I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoking weed with my homies barbeque them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke cause I dont fuck with drank
Dont pop pills either cause that shit aint cool
We just drunk a Mad Dog fore we went to school
Flick off back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now I demand respect
And if I slapped one ho then her man was next
Im a kick door robber a hotshot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If its a dare to be made then Im finna make it
But if it aint no way then believe Im finna take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle it aint worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
Ive been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga cant maintain mayne he lost
He a nerd and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
And as a nigga I come in here with my balls and my word

3429,"A friend indeed
Feeling like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditate and let it ride
Rockabye beddybye
A friend indeed
More than jimming to
More than giving you
No prohibits to
You can have a listen too
I couldnt find no one else that I could give it to
And now that we on
I could put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And Im still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
Its not that Im dope and my style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said Snoopy dont you ever cut your hair
I was dazed and amazed
Thats why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
When I was in school I used to get cool grades
When I graduated used to smoke two jays
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco
Then I got a Caddy sack just like them vatos
Posted up sixone yeah thats the block though
Ride by slow and get your ass popped though
Me and Geeda Faith and Terry thats when rump was enough
Cant forget Tim Baby Dog and HalfDead
DreLoc was a 20 Crip that showed me a lot of shit
But moving along I went from a Camaro to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
Rolling through the neighborhood checking my traps
As you get old life like just might unfold
Cant settle this might be untold
Twilight Zone live life long
Smoke you a bone and hit you a blunt
Buy you a zo and roll you a jay
And put it in the EI
And lets stay way fucked up til we DI
All in together now if you agree
And lighters in the air repeat after me
Im too blowed forever in a day
I love for ohs so
Cause everybody green aint dro
Everybody cant smoke like we smoke
Give a dog a bone
I like trees that cypress hills grow
Roll up this shit pimpin its on
Stoners worldwide singing this song

1757,"This goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that player ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Hood to hood chrome leather and wood
And it feels so good
One morning I
Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick
Feeling fucked up flicked out freaked on
Thinking about my new truck with the deep dish
Meaning deep chrome deep chrome in the deep dome
After a massage and a menage we got in the shower
Let water trickle down the brack of the cack of they booty
Got out the tub and went back to the master bedroom
One put on prada one put on Ludi I put on Gucci
Duty calls Im about to hit the scene and ball
But before I leave I spray on some Issey Miyaki
Take my truck up to the wash put the sparkle back on
Wax on wax off like Mr Miagi
Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts get Yak
So I can sip some while I split one
Chronicle enter ever follicle of my body
Calming down every molecule making sure I dont trip none
Hit one
Hop in the ride come and kick it with me
So I can take you through the soandso hundred block
And show you how my people be kicking it in the windy city
I wanna show you where I hang out at where we make our scratch
While we sit on leather gripping wood
Where the hustlers got packs and the Gs got stacks
And the pimps got Lacks rolling through the hood
And it feels so good
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes its understood
Im a baller living pimpish man leather and wood
And it feels so good
Now I done seen plenty niggas flip twentys flip twenty ones
Flip twenty twos flip Jordans flip twofours
Mega balling new clothes
Momma got a new store TV screens hundredforty spokes
And we finna roll right off madison to the manor in a droptop Lexus
Sipping Henny rolling reckless feeling so motherfucking good I could roll my vehicle to Texas
And spit it like this is for the syrup sippers
Gotta slow it down so you feel it plus it make the words thicker
And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand
When it come to spitting rapidfire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfucking man
Get the love when I hit the club gotta begin its the weekend and the DJ bumping tattoos
Track move like some southern black blues or like the coupe that got cruise
And they got shoes its packetproof instead I be the hottest rap dude
Ride to this while you peel yo hood
You could go around the block or travel the whole world when you come back its still your hood
And it feels so good
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes its understood
Im a baller living pimpish man leather and wood
And it feels so good
I spit some game wit the intellect to the media like Im in the Encyclopedia Brittanica
Come and take over the world with me girl if you good I might can see if I can be your manager
Get your career on track and your life on point and Ill show you how your taxes go
Tactics flow quicker than a hattrick go smocking on some fire galactic dro
I know its good when you smoke that fire puff that herb get that dirt hit that lick
Cop yourself a motherfucking Bently car cop yourself a motherfucking Bently crib
Pop that ass throw that dick twork that thing bust that nut
Drop that top turn the bass up put you a chameleon paint on the truck
Get iced up bumping Twista grooves as I cruise new shoes rolling smooth up in KTown
In my city come and feel it ghetto blues if you snooze you lose dont pay dues for the trepound
Take the time to kick with your home girls and feel your nuts
Keep on hating on the L big family we gon steady come up and imma still smoke good
And it feels so good
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes its understood
Im a baller living pimpish man leather and wood
And it feels so good
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes its understood
Im a baller living pimpish man leather and wood
And it feels so good

To the beat yall
Check this out 
This announcement Im about to make is very important 
Yes
Now listen 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit 
To the beat yall
Sensitive about my shit 
Cant believe Im still doing this
I thought my political views might ruin this
I figured you mightve moved on to these newer kids
My extra extended hiatuses
Who wouldve thought you woulda let me get away with this
I mean no ones waiting to see what an aging hater thinks
I kinda wanted to be finished
I didnt wanna pull my heart out let you see in it
I just wanna grow privately be free a minute
Plus my soul dont always have peace within it
I tell the truth but I can see that Im conceited with it
I make a whole lot of mistakes please dont be offended
I used to have this recurring nightmare
Im on stage with the whole city inside here
I start choking and my lungs wont provide air
Then I dropped an album they reacted to it
Started selling out First Avenue
Now all the bad dreams I have are that you no longer care for dude
Sample 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit Thats right
Sensitive about my shit 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit Say that then
Sensitive about my shit 
I love rappers with the big voices
They put the power in their lyrics so you live for it
And spit it boisterous the ignorant cant ignore it
I put the preachers style in my delivery
And I remember vividly somebody tweeted Chuck D
And asked him who the best voices are and he mentioned me
I did seven shows a week for like five years
And used to scream on that mic to make it sound clearer
Now Im staring down my most profound fear
Started catching up with my vocal cords
Im not so sure that I should perform no more
Back of my mind wonder what youre applauding for
Sample 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit Feel like the wrestler
Sensitive about my shit 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist Yes maam
And Im sensitive about my shit 
Sensitive about my shit 
Huh flying to New York to do some press
I just imagine that these people wont be too impressed
The loot he getting all at once is how they view success
But then the writers like Brother Ali sir
Ive been so excited just for writing this feature
He asking all these dope questions and did his research
And then I meet the editor and staff
And everybody got their cell phone camera to flash
And a story about how my music helped em in the past
I gotta ask yall an honest question
I mean Im beyond honored by this warm reception
But since you got respect and an obvious connection
And every time you bless us with the tiniest little speck
Of an online mention our fans all shower you with affection
And just blow up your comment section
Well what the hell I mean I aint complaining
But how come you dont place us in the hiphop conversation
They just look back with blank faces
Sample 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit That joint got awkward fast

1992,"Fuck the frail shit uh cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
Carlssons on the jeep Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped youd get the picture but you just cant photo life
Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked
The house costs a million sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know if its furnished Ima take it
My bathtub lift up my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot
Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands on a yacht with our favorite albums
A bad ho and a plate of salmon smoking and drinking
Nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal
And if you facing capital pun pass me a gun
And Ima give you time to run while I rapidly peel uh
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it

I learned the game quickly and I dont like to rent
So when I fly now I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case whos the loser
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
Motherfuckin niggas is back Jada and P
We got water X haze plus weight of the D
And Im tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted Who cares

Gun works official but niggas dont be wanting that
Why Cause they puss and they mans is lame
We Soul for Real in the hood we make Candy Rain
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you cant remember the name

JadaMWAH Ill kiss you you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood wont miss you you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean he be aight though 
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we dont laugh at death and cry at birth
Never say you cant do it til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But its a message in everything trust me even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground cause my shells is expensive
Youll know exactly why when you yellin in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky cause I got guns that crack your back
But thats not what I prefer I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
But we know how to bid so yall go head and squeal
Im comfortable far from home
Eating right getting good rest either on the bar or the phone

418,"Look At Me Now Remix Lyrics
I dont see how you can hate from outside of the club
You cant even get in
Hahaha lego
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sippin
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missin
Yeah yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years in two days
Ladies love me Im on my Cool J
If you get what I get what would you say
She wax it all off Mr Miyagi
And them suicide doors harikari
Look at me now look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now
Oh look at me now
Yeah fresher than a motherfucker
Lil nigga bigger than gorilla
Cause Im killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops I said on my dick
I aint really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
Im done
Now let a track go past like this and Twista not fuck with it
Yall done lost your mind
Let me show yall how I do it
Check it
I could hit you with the automatic flow
I could do any rhythm and any pattern that I wanna do the harder that it go
You could see blood spilling out from my body right in front of you and Ima get the dough
Now the way I be shinin be havin everybody lookin at me
Fuckin them up when I buck and Ima step and get off
I do a murder when Im trigger happy like 
I got the intricate pattern to kill em for currency when I be animate Imma be makin em holler cause Ima get dollars when Im attackin the beat Im a scholar cause Im a personification of God so you better honor what 
Mr Immaculate Im gonna wreck it a marvellous accurate lyricist
Ill be here forever
Haters wanna hate on me because they wanna hear whatever
I could spit a rhythm to a bitch and get her pussy wetter
Pimpin on a bitch and tell her I could get her pussy cheddar
So I get the camera then go and make a movie
Me up in the back of her tappin her gets the booty
Didnt wanna show my face even though she was a cutie
Nine millimeter and spillin millions of milliliters of life out a nigga if he talk shit
CEO step into my office
Coming with the awkward flow like Im sick
Go get your momma to bring a thermometer
My temperatures hot
Come up with a flow that would kill a industry and I could pick anything that I want off the lot
Never compatible cause I be intricate when I be serving you
When I be doin it at a pace I know they cant leave me
Think Twista could kill em on a track with Busta and Breezy Weezy Easy
Look at me now look at me now
Oh Im getting paper
Look at me now
Oh look at me now
Yeah fresher than a motherfucker
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas how yall doin
Im Lil Tunechi Im a nuisance I go stupid I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I dont eat sushi Im the shit no Im pollution no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater got money on my radar
Dress like a skater got a big house came with a elevator
You niggas aint eatin fuck it tell a waiter
Marley said shoot em and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then Im like ol
I dont care what you say so dont even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
Thats word to my flag and my flag red
Im out of my head bitch Im outta my mind from the bottom I climb
You aint hotter than mine nope not on my time and Im not even trying
Whats poppin slime Nothin five and if they trippin fuck em five
I aint got no time to shuck and jive these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddys dead
You faggots scared cause Im too wild been here for a while

I throw my tape on then I watch ya
Three seconds later I got ya
Shakin your head dancin instead of sittin
The rhymes kick the beats hittin you
Just like a home run slammin like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC get paid
Usin my rap style
And Im playin the background meanwhile
I aint with that you cant forget that
You took my style Im takin it back
Comin back like Return of the Jedi
Sucker MCs in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds
But never rock records how ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
Now brothers are riding me like a pony
Im no phony Im the only real micaroni
Playin the mic like its supposed to be played
New jacks you all shoulda stayed
Out of the business what is this
Amateur night at the Apollo
Get off this stage Im in a rage
Im like a lion thats been trapped inside a cage
Im the real king rap is a jungle
I never understood how could one go
To a party watch me stand around and jock me
Become a rapper then try to rock me
Schemin like a demon youre screamin and dreamin
Im from the old school I used to see men
Die for less but Im not living that way
Ill let my mic do the talkin
And let the music play
How ya like me now
Rap is an art and Im like Picasso
But of course why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture and try to get ya
Self in my shoes but they wont fit ya
Im bigger and better forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again respect I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of perfect
Vernaculars pure and I can ensure
Life or death with my breath my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
Ill make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MCs Ill make your girl say Ow
And shes jockin now how ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
It irked my nerve when I heard
A sucker rapper that I know Ill serve
Run around town sayin he is the best
Is that a test Im not impressed
Get real youre nothing but a toy
Dont ya know that Ill serve that boy
Just like a waiter hit em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he pay the bill
And leave him standin still
When hes had enough hit him with a refill
And for dessert it wont be no ice cream
Im just gonna shatter and splatter his pipe dreams
Make him feel the wrath beat him down and laugh
And when I finish then Im gonna ask him
Who is the best And if he dont say Moe Dee
Ill take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good then Ill make him sweat
Always talkin about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did how could you beat me
Youre so petrified youre scared to even meet me
My words the law thats why you dont beef
Youre nothing but a punk track star and a thief
So Im puttin you on punishment just like a child
Never touch another mic how ya like me now
How ya like me now
I could continue theres more on the menu
But Ill relax cause Im so far in you
You had enough I know youre overstuffed
And if I keep going youll be throwin up
Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day
When you used to come to my parties and pay
Nobodys ever gonna rock me and this I vow
So all I wanna say is how ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now

541,"Unparalleled Original Lyrics
Its a matter of bombing knowing that I can do it
Everytime I get on the train almost everyday I see my name
I said Yeah you know what I was there I bombed it
It doesnt matter its for me its not for no body else to see
I dont care I dont care about no body else seein it or the fact that they can read it or not
Its for me and other graffiti writers that we can read it
All these other people who dont write theyre excluded I dont care about them
No they dont matter to me This is for us
We hard to the apple core raps galore at your door
Pull crowds like a magic sword excalibor
Travel north on a saddled horse on a battle course
Rap in codes tap in morse Lo never lack the force
You need to practice more you aint in my categor
I rap for sport Decompoze got my back support
Just pass the torch and of course I can rattle yours ask for more
The more the Marry merry get your raps divorced
Slice like a razor blade mix tape brigade
Raps erase ya data base snatch your flavor call you Gatorrade
Trying to get major paid like the upper class
You cant escape from the wrath sufferin succatash
Bust your ass with a duffle bag full of mustard gas
Fingertips equipped with a touch of class
We touchin fans we trust no man here comes the plan
All we need is just a chance we must advance
This is who we are
No movie stars
No nudie bars
No jewelery jars
No groovy cars
Some truly are
We just wanna see some elevation in hiphop
Producers slash emcees when the beat drop
Decompoze
One Be Lo ripping mics unparalleled
Trackezoids on the beats unparalleled
Subterranous hiphop unparalleled
scratches My beats and rhymes perfectly configurate One Be Lo
Just clowing you circus acts and nervous cats
With gerber raps I murder wax similar to Roberta Flack
Killing you softly with every word no time for stress
Petty herbs get addressed like the gettysburg
A hundred miles and racing with a wild imagination
Even if I get the job halfdone its halfamazing
My only obligation Trackezoid collaborations
Go together like masturbation and ejaculation
Coming with accurate calculations configurations
Like the pyramids lyrically theres no equivalent
Michigan citizens shouldve been sittin in Switzerland
Listen to lyrics I roll like a michelin
Tired of rappers smoking phillies
Not really sayin nothin like Milli Vanilli my style Dont be silly
Dont need a filthy record deal people still feel me
Big willies hillbillies I rhyme without achilles
scratches from New Hip Hop by Binary Star
We keep it hot like the summer time when it comes to rhymes
What my tounge designed is nothin but thoughts from the mind
And Ive come to find most cats is deaf dumb and blind
So I gotta scat and get mines scratches underline
I hold my own weight most of yall cant say the same
Dont know the rules but still wanna play the game
What type of stuff is that Always trying to bluff a cat
Talking about your fake power moves I heard enough of that
Im trying to stay positive give it all I got to give
Retired with the wifey on the mountain ridge
Allah blessed with lots of kids grow old get burried on my right side
Everybody missed me but look on the bright side
I passed on the legacy through my wifes pregnancy
The family reunions will be more like a concert
CDs and TShirts HipHop collectables
Some cats couldve got hurt for acting unprofessional
Try to play me Glenn Close but you had the wrong one
Couldnt hurt me in the long run peep the song son
scratches You name it weve done it One Be Lo
This is who we are
No movie stars
No nudie bars
No jewelery jars
No groovy cars
Some truly are
We just wanna see some elevation in hiphop
Producers slash emcees when the beat drop
Drop fades

3081,"Im thug for life aint no changin me
Im thug for life aint no changin me
I pop off guns and live dangerously
Im lot more nigga than you aimin to be
My Range bling platty chain hang to the knee
Im thug for life aint no changin me
Aiyyo who got the drop my gun been cocked
Spits from fourfives to flintlocks pinky finger with the pimp rock
Hustle on dim blocks and sip Hennrock
Draw quick got a second hand like Big Ben clock ya heard 
Reach for that heat put your wig in the wind pop
Fill your belly with ten shots if I get hit
And you see blood then flood the bullet wound with gin shots
Put beef in a Slim Jim box
Bitch you wanna pinch and win slot
Clap lead until your big friend drop
Niggasll front until I send chin shots
Beat the rock until they send cops or what 
Til one of usll get carried out on the thin cot
Emergency room skin chopped by ten docs
Got it locked like a bid in the state pen box
When I dares peers hangin to where my shin stop before I struck rich
Fucked bitches and killed em with a ten inch cock freal 
Bitch nigga stuck him with a ten inch ox yknow 
Bread bloods and stiff vodka deep in this game
Know the feds want the clique locked up
We love brain so we headhunt like witchdoctors
My lil momma let lead dump from big poppa
Even the Jake surrounded the spread with pig choppers
That taste preposterous tear gas tanks of oxygen
Like we in banks with hostages what we want 
All we want is minks and ostriches what 
Diamond cuff links and proper shit
Snitches left stinkin in carpet stiff
Or get they carcasses turned to link sausages freal 
Aint nuttin sweet we known for bangin cartridges
We got the heart for this
No matter how light or dark it is ya heard 
No matter how light or dark it is freal 
Thug for life what Rep by strips killers 
Let loose clips dealers Stack mad chips you know we 
Bag bad chicks my niggas Push fly whips all of the 
Hoes blow dick nigga G flows sick what 
My whole life about chrome rims and stone gems what 
Big boned skins Capone brims dick blown in my own Benz
Quick to Scarface thugs who raise up blown brims
Dolla trickin never politickin with grown mens
Ideas of settin me up for loot I wont bend
Just make that light bulb at the top of your dome dim uhhuh 
Who raphappy nigga keep the lyrics and poems grim
Get found at the bottom of the river with stone Timbs word 
Babyface swimmin flash stomach and toned limbs
Wake up every mornin work out in the home gym
Reppin this rap game until my zone ends uhhuh 
Til mixin boards melt down the microphone bend yea 
I spit about street shit but never condone sin
Kept it thug for life baby followed my own trend
Kid Word thug shit
Queens shit for life nigga

1714,"Get yourself together now because its hit time
Youre known as the hit makers
Record breakers party makers
Theyll make your back crack your liver quiver
For all you cats who never put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut more glide in your stride
If you dont dig that you got a hole in your soul
If you dont dig this mess you came to the wrong address
We gon sing mighty loud and clear
Ayo the music made em jump back
Fuck that how yall gonna contrast somethin fat without lettin Ali touch that
Nothin whack leaves his lips youre not serious
I got few equals and no superiors so here he is 
A seasoned veteran of ego reckin
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Yall aint fuckin with the ahk so quit your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening so you heed the lessons
So no
Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it somebodys bound to catch it no breakage
Never that we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Slug or even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though
Fuck that sucka jump back 
I hold the game like Notre Dame I know your dame
We call her hunch back Ali run that
From cats lips to gods ears
We line yall punk bastards in crosshairs
Applying our thug tactics till yall scared
Dont stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs ohh yeah 
Fuck that jump back yo whats that
Drippin off her nuts wait why she got a nut sack
You fuckin rappers are shemales
From the retail to the email defeat felt cause you need help
Yall need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for yall its still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah

Rappers steppin to 
Ah yeah they get their shit spun
I throw a roll of quarters in cyphers and bet I hit one
Yo I dont care were you represent son wheres your chick from 
Well take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run
Listen I know your mission some type of magician that likes to go fishin
On the mic with air tight precision elitism keeping tradition
When you aint even keeping the rhythm the DJ is spinnin
Calm down little camper Ive got the answers
You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers
It doesnt matter turn it up what the fuck you think that amps for
I right wrongs write rhymes write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho
And I should but instead Ill just pay the waiter and go
But if I didnt have a wife yo your kidsd be albinos
Your respect is like a stick in the grass
Mean mugs and tree hugs Ill go on without it
I wear my toilet paper so that yall can kiss my ass
With your tongue out and write a love song about it
Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles
The love comes in vomit the money comes in dribbles
The Minnesota missiles self taught
Communication mutilation holding pictures of your sister naked
Ha ha You too drunk to walk down the stairs
And now you standing here choking on my pubic hairs
Telling me your name as if you think the brother cares
If you keep bumping your gums we can fucking take it there
Brother Ali 
I make a room full of punk rocks stop and do wop
Wrestle shots from a cop and ask him whos your pops
Whos you daddy Fuck that Jump back and act happy
Sing my fucking chorus before I punch you in your face 
Yall need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for yall its still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
Yall need to watch and observe and then follow

686,"World wide lamper world wide lamper world wide lamper
Between my legs the ladies like the way I ball handle
Especially when Im going to the basket making examples
Reverse dunking a punk and tap your girl on the butt
When she shoot at the foul line
Coach many from the top like Phil Jackson
The matte perrriwinkle Rolls Royce Wraith is accurate
Job application rappers you can scratch when I itch
The nutsack once a month on the fifth
Your mommy twerking while I smoke a spliff
She a mother of 19 kids pass her a brick
When she wear a wig export the imports
My jockstrap sniffed by TSA at the airport
I see a lot of Mickey Mouses on the wrist fossils dont count
Show you the Rolex out of bounds
Prada leather trench
Your lady show pretty pink to be Hershey dog brown
Take her off the campus with Dion and Colonel Sanders
The hawks looking for a good dude to cook food in Atlanta
Serve me frozen sodas from Fanta
More leg room show me where they expand us
I heard of Kurt Rambis by the lot playing Krampus
World wide lamper world wide lamper
How gully do I keep it
I can make you richest in the world so stop sleeping
In the rap game Im the best kept secret
Never made a penny from it you know how Im eating
Why they mad though 
They mad cause Im Fonzie
Walk up in the bar leaving with your aunt Ronnie
Plotting up a scheme like my last names Ponzi
Push a button on you suckers so dont ever get cocky
What you do for fun 
I get a kick out of winning
My main man Roddie gets a kick out of sinning
Doesnt know gymnastics but he always starts flipping
While Im at the waterfalls on the rocks Im sipping
They must like you 
Word being treated
From the roof of my castle looking down I see you scheming
Stickup kids jotting in my motor now they pleading
Every human being that ever tried to challenge been defeated
You life life 
I live life like a coozhound
With a quarter ki of coke and my goose down
Hit the dance floor ladies get loose now
Every time I leave I knock boots down
BARS Murre gives fucks none
I got that hot shit spitting out my tongue tongue
World wide lamp world wide lamp
Dirt Nasty baby faded now 
Cause I socked your mom in front of Papa Johns
Bumpin Dr Octagon with your Walkman on
Dont make me switch my pitch up
I smack my bitch up in a Cadillac pickup truck
Those dont exist 
Im world wide lamping now
Skinny dip with your bitch II I am the captain now
I am the captain 
I sail the seven seas in a gold scuba kit that cost 87 Gs
Thats expensive 
The ice cold freeze in the thaw on my dick when its 88 degrees
Say cheese ladies hit their knees
Cause my whip so sick that it got a disease
Rest in peace 
Fuckboy wearing a turtleneck and corduroy
Im eating dead Bok Choy with Soulja Boy
Yep the palette exquisite
My gynecologist make a sushi fried chicken
Thats racist 
She be on some cop shit
Talk shit Imma sock you with a chopstick
Nah bitch Imma knock you on the cockpit
Drop and kick your mom dick in a mosh pit
My suit is extinct
Its made of of ref panda bear beef ring
I meant to say its made out left panda paw and lion mink
All red leather bikini Sandusky made forever
And ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

3409,"Ill battle you on the net Ill battle you in the flesh
Ill battle you over the phone you can call me collect
Verbally vicious telekinetically gifted
Took a minute to exhibit that Im sick with it
Have you any idea what Ill do to crews like you
How many niggas in my career Ive ran through
At a thousand degrees Celsius I make MCs melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Canibus is the type to fight for mics
Beatin niggas to death and beatin dead niggas to life
While you niggas is babblin
My lyrics is travelin like a javelin to stab you in the abdomen
The intellectual athlete accurately rappin so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically
I walk the BLock withe the GLock Cocked
Tryna get the DRop on the Cops
The Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin to damage you spittin understandable slang at you
Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns
Whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for 10 seconds
Whats the matter with yall Ill spatter yall
Against the muthafuckin wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
Ill hop into the back seat of a cab and rhyme
Til the meter says 9 9 9 9
Yea its the CQuel the CQuel Yo
Im hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores
To every single pore in my skull
Hard from my mouth to my jaws
From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored
And from my balls in my draws to the floor
I pray to God they hurry up and start the third World War
So I can start World War IV and murder us all
I dont give a fuck if you rich or you poor
Dont give a fuck if you got ya picture in The Source or Forbes
I dont give a fuck who won an award
On stage tryna thank God Ill chop they tongue off with a sword
Let they blood pour all on the floor
If it aint a cordless they gettin punched in the jaw and hung wit the cord
Ill leave they corpse stiff as a board
Like frozen meat tryna thaw then bury em under the morgue
Gettin in my way is like jumpin in front of a car
Breakin the sound barrier that means the car is in front of the horn
By the time you hear it blowin its too late to respond
By the time you feel it hit you Im gone
Ill send ya to hell where you belong
So by the time ya body hits the floor
Ya spirit wont be in it no more
Who could flow for 4 minutes or more
Without breaks without mistakes without flaws
I got millions of styles and I mastered em all
A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall
Whoever grabs the mic after mell get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and ya crew
Im the illest nigga alive watch me prove it
Ill snatch ya crown with ya head still attached to it
I battle you for the respect Ill battle you over a blank check
Ill battle you with a gun to my neck
Ambushin emcees jumpin out the trees like Vietnamese
In fatigues covered with leaves
Next year youll be walkin around the How Can I Be Down
Conference with a laminate that said I Got ShittedOn By Canibus
Turn ya head round gimme the cheddar
Id rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever
Fuck yall you dont impress me and no one can test me
An emcee so ill I got AIDS scared to catch me
Canibus is what the hardcore niggas is waitin on
Debatin on what the fuck is takin so long
Well Im here now verbal ass whippins bout to get shared out
Wack niggas bout to get aired out
Faggot niggas get they ass teared out
Grab a wise man by his goatee and rip his fuckin beard out
Cold beat a niggas ass like Stout
Then bust a shot in the muthafuckin courtroom and watch it clear out
A hundred thousand mile warranty metaphorically
Ill use a hundred thousand styles and murder you orally
I took a lion on tour wit me made him respect authority
Smacked him in the head for tryna roar at me
Lyrics got my undivided loyalty
And there aint nothin on this God damn planet thats worth more to me
In the name of HipHop niggas could corner me torture me
Slice me then stitch me up like embroidery
Way back before goldplated male and female
RCA jacks was used for crystal clear playback
I was tryna blaze ADATS and if a nigga said my demo was wack
Id beat his ass and took my tape back
Yeah nigga What Yeah nigga take that
Anybody get outta line get they face slapped quick fast
The CanIBusll buss yo ass
Then Ill bust you wit a shotgun blast
Its not fun so I dont laugh
To me this rap shit is as serious as the death of a loved one
You know how you be feelin sad
Thats how I feel when I grab the microphone but niggas dont understand
Canibus is unequivocally the illest killin machine in the industry
For the 20th century
Trapped in a max security building
Sufferin from a severe illness called brilliance

1412,"Ima warn ya
In your circle dont mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
I plead the fifth Hell no and No your honor
So the streets honor me humble believe Im on it
I grab my momma Im headed to a different genre
They couldnt understand me now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy crack greed homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight nothing recent
But Ima call the state for back pay they owe me grievance
And you cant knock that block the block with the top that
Open up that Fanta I got that
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Lowlifes with no knives niggas is cutting throats
For that white like Tommy and green paper with the ghosts
Thats power I play my post one day
Youre the best thing since sliced bread the next day youre toast
I can never be toast hell no
I get money in lump sums yea I like my bread by the loaf
I like head by the coast as I stare at the pacific
She asked if I liked it Keep going girl youre terrific
Yeah baby see Im Clyde and Im looking for a Bonnie mami
To get a Gucci ghost watch rings from Avianne
I share my wealth humble beginnings hunger strangled us
Pops had a choice me or drugs he chose angel dust damn 
And the mother some was living more dangerous
Tax season the only time they was claiming us
Picture it like Kodak this bracelet you could hold that
If Im needed know that you can
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need

534,"My mind blows decisions at times indecisive
I think about the paradox that life is
Keep my head to the sky and understand what Christ is
Turn off the news cause every day is a crisis
Lifeless niggas on the couch weeded out
Its certain types of niggas in my life I weeded out
I believe in the route of soul before paper
No gold before labor truth told with no glaziers
Days are getting darker quick
I was told it was written Ima author it
Wanna go the same place that the martyrs went
The black figures on the wall in my apartment
Like LaDainian yall I be charging it
Touching down with the people from my town
Its the Chi that be giving me my ground
Dug in the crates of my soul and I found clarity
Be yourself ah and be so clear come on 
Ayo just be yourself and be so clear 
So just be yourself yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself and be so clear 
Be yourself yeah and be so clear 
Ayo just be yourself and be so clear 
So just be yourself yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself and be so clear 
Toiled in the trenches faced judges on benches
Betrayed by some that I fed not to mention
Standing here now in the best condition
Up outta the dirt so I suggest you listen
See money cant make you or me
Protect my mind with nines cause it shines more than jewelry
Used to do things that werent too productive
Now I breathe life into mics for your comfort
I see past the groupies and golddiggers to fine women
How Im living Doing me and not savagely driven
Taught the game of fortune and fame
So Im not playing no more I hold the torch with flames
Ive lost and gained at the same time
MCs biting and swagger jacking still commit the same crimes
Once you see past the surface
That trash is worthless with me you get a lasting purpose
Be yourself and be so clear come on 
Ayo just be yourself and be so clear 
So just be yourself yall be so clear
