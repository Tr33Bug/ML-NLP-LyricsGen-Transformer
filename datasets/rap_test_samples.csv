2095,"I know a fat girl she wears a orange skirt
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work
Shell take food stamps and a travelers cheque
Because her hair and her face and her lifes a wreck
She wears a bright blonde wig some high heeled pumps
Shes down in the dumps so shes sellin her rump
Shes a hot little momma and she works every day
If you wanna pay to play heres where she stays
Shes at the
Bristol Hotel Room 515
The Bristol Hotel Where that at Jamaica Queens 
I seen her standin there slutty as could be
Offering the putty for a ittybitty fee
Every red light shell come over to your ride
Or shes standin in the doorway tellin you to come inside
The Bristol Hotel cause it aint no thing
And her meat tastes better than Burger King
Japanese executives in threepiece suits
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place
The girlies in the Bristol theyre all in cahoots
He fell asleep and got robbed and cold chumped his face at the
Bristol Hotel Room 515
The Bristol Hotel Where that at Jamaica Queens 
Party people check the story cause the story is ill
Its the story of two men one Harold one Bill
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool
Never ever rush thats the golden rule
I been comin to the Bristols ten years of my life
Ayo what the hell Yo man thats my wife
The 
Bristol Hotel Room 515
The Bristol Hotel Where that at Jamaica Queens 
You see a Bristol girl is a one of a kind
And if you know her good enough she wont make you stand on line
Shell let you inside make you pay for the ride
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died
You say What the heck because you already paid
Not knowin that the guy that went before you had AIDS
Bang bang boogie she was so amusin
Next week youre at the clinic gettin blood transfusions

2552,"Big boy
I said give me two pairs
Cause I need two pairs
So I can get to stompin in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin in my Air Force Ones
I like the allwhite hightop strap with the gum bottom
Theres somethin about em now dirty thats why I got em
I leave em strapped and laced and come up out em
The last person that touched em I damn near shot em
Now if you look and see limegreen Forces its Kiwi
You couldnt get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hiphop may niggas flipflop
Yeah my Force Ones in tiptop me now form a flip flops
Me I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where Im at
Dont get me wrong man
Now Murphy Lee aint dumb man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none man
You may not have three or four
But you got one man big boy 
I said give me two pairs
Cause I need two pairs
So I can get to stompin in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin in my Air Force Ones


We up in Foot Locker Im lookin like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo
Cause shes just standin there as if Im shootin free throws
I said Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes
She said I love you Murph especially in the white n blue
I said The white n blue sound nice make it twice
And I signed an yo autograph yo Thanks for the advice
I keep it real dirty dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops which the clear sole
But its Timbs and fat laces when its cold
But when the winter go burrr and the hot summer flow
Then its back to the all purpose wit them lil dots in the toe
Aint nothin stopping this dough that Im spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force NE behind the O
Okay Lee I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole I got a wider shoe
You see that lowmid Skittle purple coupe Im drivin in
Kyjuan were you getting dem colors are you dyin them 
Ten is my size in dem no point in tyin dem
Aint no point in tryin these on they know Im buyin dem
Now dont nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them three quarters them lows they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff em you fucked up your whole night
Whats my basis The look on store owners faces
This kids outrageous hes buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop em I gut em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my Daytons
I said give me two pairs
Cause I need two pairs
So I can get to stompin in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin in my Air Force Ones
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn when those came out So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem
Look Im tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all you wildin fish bowlin em all
I got some fifteens security buyin shoes and all
Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what Im bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum and leather gray
Ones in the back and yo the pair you got on display check 
Now in the box is where I keep mine keep mine 
You should peep mine peep mine 
Maybe once or twice but never three times
Im just a sneaker pro I love Pumas and shell toes
But cant nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl
I said give me two pairs

398,"Goes around
What comes around goes around
Sittin here reminiscin back to high school
When everytime I see you girl you know that I drool
Daydreamin in class thinkin what would I say
When I saw you but you never looked my way
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
I have to give it to you though you was topshelf babe
I asked myself time and time again what was it
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me
You didnt have to conversate with me I can say that
It woulda made my day if you just had waved back
I used to buy you candy lollypops and gum drops
I even pack a extrasandwich in my lunch box
Youre treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
If anyone could make you feel good girl I could
But you give me that look like you dont wanna be bothered
But thats okay just keep on frontin see
Cause one day Imma make it and youll be wantin me
Been tryin hard ever since I graduated
To make it big and yes I finally made it
Been doin shows videos and tv
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
Now the tables have turned and now its me youre hawkin
Now I turn up my nose and keep on walkin
You see ladies marvel me in clubs frequently
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
Rememberin how she played me in the past
Yeah we can talk Im in a rush please make it fast
And we can start off with all the men you been with
And dont come poppin that justafriend bit
Remember how you used to diss me and play me out how
Come you got so much stuff to talk about now
The words around town that youre on the money tip
But sorry I cant do nothin for ya honey dip
So pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor
And over to the bar because thats what I came for
Cuties pamperin me with champagne and roses
As I think to myself thank God for showbiz
Everywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm
Drinkin and thinkin who will be my victim
Here comes that girl that used to diss me
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
Yup get your coat and we could shoot north
Took her to the crib and cold knocked her boots off
After i got it yo I never did call back
Thinkin how she used to front like she was all that
Its a new game and the odds are in my favor
She caught the vapors and nothin could save her
What comes around goes around
You know what Im talkin about
What comes around goes around

Welcome to the Prisoner of Conscious
Brainiac dumdum bust the scientifical
You feel it all up in your soul we getting spiritual
You heard Im coming back its so scary I put the fear in you
I murder every track cause the rhymers like to stare at you
Real shit back its a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof
Im back with the classical shit I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer
And then I vaporize ya my paper may surprise ya
No need to brag on my paper cause Im a naturizer
I vibrate higher the truth break liars
I chose who is like us
The lovers the fighters the writers the exciters
Cut the grass we could see the vipers
We cut the glass cause we the diamonds
I be listening to real shit real spit like die hard feeling
Type of shit the fake niggas find hard to deal wit
Im on a higher plane Im destroying em while I build them
My threat cant be contained so my name on Obama kill list
Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Moving the through darkness the light is whats in front of me
Front on me you posers exposing your insecurities
Supposedly its wack and replaces lack of maturity
The purity you need to get in the game is gone
Aint no conspiracy stop looking for someone to blame it on
Gotta pay a debt took a stale style and I made it fresh
Wait a second got your girl wetter than tomato flesh
Waiting on me with baited breath
Welcome to the

Everything is moving Im getting me a percentage
Vintage nothing but the sky is my ascendant

Pimping down to the socks and so is business
The all night workout like 24Hour Fitness
Yall niggas is adorable incorrigible
The praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignoring you why
The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth
Order suit niggas is gassed up
Petroleum a lab when these niggas get swept up
Custodians of culture back to the future rap DeLorean
I class up the joint the spit is valedictorian

A different kind of rapper language that I am saying
To all the party people that absorbs the info

Maniac brainiac for doing my dance
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Hypnotize your body and like you do Bacardi and
You wont be fighting or illing you just be partying
Down with the funky sound with yours truly

And when you hear the Biz Markie I get the job done
Yes Im the MAR the KIE you know thats me
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny but I dont be caring
I rock the Latin Quarter Rooftop Union Square and
Roseland the Heartthrob Madison Square Garden
Even rocked for the Worlds Fair at Javits Center
Pardon the way that I be talking bout the places I be rocking
I love to perform for the people that be clocking
Not sayin that youre on mine or on it like a hornet

Making people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment

So hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail
And shop nonstop but how I hiphop
On the mic and like make you coop
erate with the rhythm that is what I give em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
It might sound confusing the style that Im using
But in the end Im sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny oh honey its just ridiculous
Dont try to front come on and admit you was
Thrilled chilled your heart was fulfilled
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it so lets go the lap

3382,"Ms Hill Lyrics
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Ms Hill you got skills thats a gift its real
Get ill what you spit got the power to uplift the heel
I wish I could talk to Lauryn
I mean excuse me Ms Hill
And let her know how much we love her is real
The industry was beating her up
Then those demons started eating her up
She need a savior thatll bleed in a cup yup
We used to kick it in the salad days
When she look at me like she aint know me when she see me nowadays
I nod she nod back thats how it stay
Her songs still better than anything out than Hot or Power play
Remember how they accused her of saying he did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing and tell the Pope about herself
Just after she left the Fugees started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelles Block Party
She made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful
Took Black Star on tour in Europe I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but Im sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower the main characters name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls selfesteem was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She aint healthy Im a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load but no


Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Ms Hill you got skills thats a gift its real
Get ill what you spit got the power to uplift the heel
Got your assistant on the the phone I need to talk to Lauryn
And I wanna walk through the storm and I could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
Please this no disrespect to whoever your man is though
This relationship is strictly music like DAngelo
I know you hate Babylon and wanna see it fall
But they wont let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope you give us faith you the one
They dont like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come whoa
Now thats powerful sis its black power
We get money keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I aint saying you Christ that would be sacrilegious right
But you can blow and you nice sisters them raps is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devils last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read Francis Crest or anything
By Third World Press impressed
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Donda West yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it cause I really aint got the words to say it
But yo
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words I should say
There are no words you should say

And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you dont need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense I did all I could do
You just took me for granted you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I dont know you no more fuck it I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb the less weight Im trying to carry
Dem niggas holdin on for dear life bringin me drama
But Im only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga yous a grown man get yourself together
Forget about the past nows a better time than never
Matter of fact Its time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out and stop burning Cris bridges
You little bitches
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
Yeah this industrys full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship
Cos I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when Im around yall
But soon as I leave niggas be prayin on my down fall
Is it cause youll never sell as many records
My bitches always look better you fail at business endeavours
Or that people thought you were clever but now they know you stupid
And misery loves company now that youre going through it
Somebody tell these rappers I walk hard in these Louis
So get out of here you dont want no part of this shit Dewey
I see them drugs got yall trippin too soon
Thats why you find me in the club every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
Ill be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then trillion
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals
For you to know its not the money its the principle
So I cant expect you to know what Im talkin bout
Our issues are deep within we cant just talk em out
Niggas is fighting inside we cant just walk em out
These bridges burning so fast we cant just stomp em out
As if you know what Im talkin bout
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed

Heaven seems so far away so
Who am I
To deny
I could use some time to play so
All aboard if you need
Me Ill be ah in Las Vegas
In Las Vegas 
Lets take a trip today
A little getaway
So I can get away
From all the drama
So I get in the plane
So I can get some space
Clear out my mental haze
And clean my karma
So feelin really great
Flew to this little place
So I could stimulate
A happy aura
So I exit my base
This is a little taste
Of when I went to Vegas
Back in the summer
Clearer days crazy nights

So I get off the plane
Smilin like What today
Right now a brother may
Take off his slippers
That was the purpose hey
Just to relax and maybe
Put some words on paper
But then the picture
Got cloudy with temptation
From all the gamble tables
To the pretty ladies
To all the bars for
Like every 20 feet
Now see thats plenty drinks
With all this Hennessey
Man Im a goner
Clearer days crazy nights
Heaven seems so far away so

So Im corrupted now
My wallet was in doubt
But now theres fuzz and powder
Inside the content
My livers puffin out
My credits runnin out
Ill go for one more round
Cause maybe Ill hit
The lucky number slot
Won back what I have lost
I gotta taste ya now
Im goin nonstop
Now that my credits out
Although my head is poundin
Just then I jetted out
Up To the pawnshop
Sold everything I had
To a Korean lad
And in the back he had
A fly masseuse place
With ladies lookin bad
One of them took me back
The ending that I had
Was happy
Oops wasted
Everything again
So now my trip must end
These vices suck you in
I didnt come for
All this so I escaped

3393,"I come from the God body era
I come from standing on street corners
Smoking blunts out of white owls with 40s
Building and destroying about the suns
And the planets and the moons and the stars
About the nature of man
About knowledge wisdom and understanding
And you had to show and prove
And you had to be right and exact
Voulezvous rendezvous coucou le poopoo come on
Yeah Chris yeah I like that right there yeah
Hah come on Yeah
KAYTRANADA classic
Waste these niggas son I got a doctorate in rockin it
Pardon we got it poppin its marvelous nigga watch it
You follow a carbon copies Im stoppin to intervene
Youre erroneous these the phoniest rappers Ive ever seen
When I take flight Im traveling light thats a double entendre
For when Im touring exploring outside the genre
Illuminate when I grabbin the mic its so bright itll blind you
Yeah Im back with a friendly reminder
Were two ships thatre passing in the night but alas
You got to run into the iceberg Im cracking this shit in half
Traveling light not talking about back of the back
First I get back in the lab then I hit the road Ill be back in a flash
Im Barry Allen mixed with Harry Allen
My blood hot as volcanic rock forming canary diamonds they find on Canary Islands
My rhymes inspired by enviroments of the very violent
Im the voice of a generation thats very silent
I stick to my convictions like Ive been indicted
All you niggas throwing me shade you about to get enlightened


Travel light travel light
Traveling light travel light
You grinding til the sun up
Whether its cold murder the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die so
Brooklyn is changing and so am I
I see you on the other side travel light
Ay Im faster than the speed of sound
Smashing through these barriers Im blasting out your speakers now
Travel around the planet till I landin where Im needed now
We entertainers they wanna call us leaders now
Woah extra baggage not in the plans Ill shop when I land
Stop for the fans every airport from Okinawa to Osaka Japan
Stop assuming I live in your time zone
Jetlag is my reality the road is my home I roam
Your downfall is you should probably get out more
I been planning out tours with a band of outlaws
Im packing my bags just marijuana and magazines
Wrapping the flag around a pistol the red the black and the green
Never crashing the grill is mean when Im whipping machines
Dipping between all these commuters they moving slow like they sippin the lean
Are they living the dream Get to they office
And that computers drifting off until they spit start to drip from the screen

I see you on the other side travel light
City of broken promises my mission is reconnaissance
Its dangerous for anybody following
Thats why I take biting as a compliment its proof of my dominance
Its the haters way of congratulating me for my accomplishments
Well Im so atop of this demolishing all the charlatans
To whisper in the ears of your congressmen
Shoving dollars in their pockets the more we locked up the more they profiting
They building empires like Ottoman
Now who you wanna face The sharks in the water or the snakes in the boat
The lesser of two evils be fighting for fake votes
We walking through the valley of darkness so stay close
Need the light at the end of the tunnel to make a toast
Raise a glass to our glorious past we the wave of the future
Never confusing protesters for looters
Silencing Radioheads and OK Computers
Travel to Mecca like Mansa Musa so lets go

Yo whats up this is Queen Latifah in the house
Definetely representin Jersey on the love love
Coolin out in Cali shootin Living Single
But damn I miss home
I cant forget New Jersey
Verse 1 Queen Latifah 
When I think of home I think of a place where theres love overflowin
And all my family and peeps I knew when I was growin
Mommy and daddy made me proud to an Owens
Taught me to keep goin
Straight up but never knowin
I would become Her eminence and royal highness
The Queen Latifah no doubt one of New Jerseys finest
So set if off
Get em up on my own
Cause Jerseys what I think about when I think of home
Dont let no one get close to you except the chosen few
Stick with the ones who meant the most to you
When you were broke and blue thats how fam do
Thats how you stay true around these snakes
That freakin smile when they hate you
Im quick to take the ride down for intown  
Just another day living on a down 
My experience legit my rhymes is on hit
Its mad truth to the rumor we the shit I cant forget
Verse 2 Queen Latifah 
I used to work at Burger King but after takin orders
I used to take the path to Latin Quarters across the waters
When I learned to do the Wop yo I couldnt stop
I brought it back around the way to show the people on my block
Teacher teacher tell me how you do it
It looks so simple like that there is nothin to it
So we meet at Irvington High halls and after school Id run
To the Willowbrook mall boostin with Sulamon
I had a talent for getting em for gear
Petty thief small time crook of the year
But I chilled cause I had bigger dreams than to steal
And Ramsey came for me and Apache to put our voices on a reel
And I could hear myself on the radio
45 King Special Red Alert Show
Cause thats what life was all about to me
REP Flavor Unit representin Jersey
Verse 3 Queen Latifah 
I think about my mom and my brothers when Im on swoll
Shakim when Im on swoll
My baby sister when Im on swoll
Hoffstead when Im on swoll
IllTown when I on swoll
JillTown JC when Im all swoll

So come on with the come on
Get down with the get down
Im down with my hometown sound

227,"Enter the dragon as I start to braggin and taggin
And sayin Im baggin all rappers on the bandwagon
Feel the fury of a renegade well men I slayed
So send the aid cause I penetrate
Bein the best up with lyrics I dress up so dont even mess up
Or try to press up its better to fess up
Cause if a rapper ever goes too far man
I start to screamin on MCs like Tarzan
So witness the glare when I appear
Nonell compare so take a seat in the rear
Child you gotta understand you just the man
Sittin next to the man sittin next to the man sittin next to the man
And no one friar comes higher than the messiah
Sparkin the mic like a live wire til I retire
Whatever the comp is I burn em like fire
With all the blow I hit em hard like PIYAH
So take your hand and fold cause this is total control
And no one grabs a hold huh
You got somethin to say before its told
If you speakin on me you better hablo espaol
Cause I aint tryin to have none of the pentyante
Mumble jumble kick yak you better get back
Clear the way when you see me comin through
Back up and bow nuff respect due
Nuff respect due
Uhh I come down and put my weight on it
Drop somethin straight on it and sound great on it
Parties erupt and stages corrupt
I pour like a quart in a cup word up
I GET the JOB done
Makin the young boys say Daddy I dont want none
You puttin the man to a boy before I can even destroy
I played him like a toy Heavens to Merkatroid
Check my Modus Operandi
Those who know my name know I aint about games
I go beyond knockin em out the box
You want to be a comedian Aight wheres Redd Foxx
So if I want you believe Im gonna get you
I wouldnt give a damn if Tony Terry was witchu
So when I come in the same place as my enemy
They all start runnin like their name was Sheer Energy
I wont say what you are but Ill hit you
Youre found on a woman and a penis goes in you
Another clue your first letters are Pyou
Act like you know boy nuff respect due
UHH put in rotation better than creation with acceleration
My vocabulary is very
Clever like a trick hand sinkin em like quicksand
Makin the competition feel like they need a kickstand
To support what they thought wouldve brought them
Some type of victory but none of them could get with me

Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean cruisin

They tell me Hussle dumb it down you might confuse em
This aint that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to

Cant express how I curved detectives
Guess its evidence of a divine presence blessings
Held me down at times I seem reckless F it
You got an L but got an E for effort stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert then left him
Aint no answer to these trick questions
Money Makin Nip straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known flick up and jail pose
Snatch a champagne bottle from Ricos til T show
Whatever nigga playin chess not checkers nigga

Its the return of Bin Laden grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators roll deep with my entourage
My whole crews fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin my hand
I remember in the elevator we was playin corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin on us
Statens where the war is
Where the court systems running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I cant call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 10304 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island Im from
And yall dont want no problems with them
We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough it aint no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the ville from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes encouraging skills
From rat packs the smallest crews were enormous
We hit em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those thats more sensitive to heat and shock
We grindin down to the bone my name grounded in stone
Im Mr Violence we loungin with chrome
Mr Violence we lounge in his home hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems got a jones for dinero
16zero my songs we throwin elbows
The hoes cling sho thing we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right we choose Queens
Yeah we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast he aint ghost
Its no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit witness the killing chilling crime scene
Body on the block eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster gotta blast ya cause I have to
The rat pack is back from the island of Stat
Leave you cursed dust cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncers ear off let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See its pure let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You dont want no drama Im flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash

Earth wind and fire sounded so heavenly
Ohio players and Curtis Mayfield
Aretha Franklins picture on a playbill
Al Green in a tight suit all white
Minnie Riperton high notes all night
Moms even had a box full of 45s
Put the needle down yea that sounds sorta live
Sound like the kind of groove I could rap over
Got drunk off the beat then I was back sober
Bring that part back yea Imma murder that
Donny Hat on the track with Roberta Flack
Hide records
In the bag
Sneak them out before she notice that they gone
Gotta think
I dont know
Should I rap of my moms favorite song
Better hope I dont scratch it or thats it
Imma get my ass kicked thats a classic
Cant explain that I was just borrowing it
Moms on a rampage lookin for her Parliament
And Donny Hathaway feelin like a castaway
Hiding in grandmoms room more than half the day
If I told her that her Parliament at brian crib
And nobody home now Imma be a crying kid
But its seeming like Im safe for the time being
My uncle gettin all the blame far as Im seeing
I just gotta lay low like a snake belly
Its a sticky situation like grape jelly
Im on the titanic or some other boat
Got my mother and her brother at each others throat
You better hope mommy never find out
Cause if she does then thats your ass
You know damn well if you touch one
And you get caught thatll be your ass
NinteenSeventy Something
And the year is
Ninteenseventy Something
The final act Brians at the door
With a black and red nap sack
Came to bring the vinyl back
I put it back before anybody notices
He said close call I said yea I know this is
But I got away with it like the perfect crime
And made the fresh tape man it was worth the time
An aggravation and stress almost made a mess
Shed a found out its me she would of laid to rest
But Im over like a fat rat
That was smart its a good thing you hid em in that backpack
It feels so good to get that out the way
Now Im out the door back out to play
Im about to say these are the good time like Chic
And then I hear my mom shriek
Duval
Get back in here uhoh 
How did my record get scratched
I know you did it
Go get my belt
Cmon ma
Thats it get my belt now

Black Metaphor 
Damn I grew up on that Cash Money
Bling bling was well known to flash money
Hit the liquor store after my Vic authority
Quick to switch a bitch up pick up me a thicker shorty
Pistol on me nigga aint no pickin on me
We veterans so its better if you go get your army
A thug holiday is where your body lay
Me and Trick Daddy come from a common place
So us gettin money thats just a conversation
Its so hard stayin rich and miss the confrontations
Cigars in the Oval Office Ronald Reagan
Hug Barack Obama whisper Assalmu alaykum
Live for the moment die for the streets
Bible on the dash kilos on the seat
I used to see you niggas on my TV screen
And wondered what was life like was it all a dream
And then I met you out on LiveNation dates
Came to the realization that your watch was fake
Damn you nearly broke my heart
I really thought you niggas really owned them cars
I used to look up to you nigga
Ugh


Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin
Ima bring my niggas with me if I lose or win
Bought a fleet of cars let the bitches tag along
This little thing of ours not the ones to tattle on
Omerta the code Met Ball parties with Vogue
Still blowin thick smoke while you powder your nose
Such a head rush until the day the feds rush
Thats when you niggas wish you put your bread up
Leased whips bad blood that shitll sink ships
Fast money comin slow you better think quick
Rap game so much fuck shit done
Thats why this 45 in my Trukfit trunks
Fuck a skateboard I went and got a Wraith boy
Catholic record labels niggas gettin raped boy
Birdmans a priest moans in his synagogue
Publishin is a sin repent forgive me Lord
Shots fired home invasion out on Palm Isle
Red beam detonators who the bomb now
Look you in your eyes nigga fore I say good night
And pray that Mannie Freshll get to see the light
Damn Stunna
I loved you nigga
Hate it came to this
Maybach Music 
You stole them boys pub and bought a foreclosure
Scott Storch demons in it which is more poison
I handed over records never charged a coin
But could sense the sentiment Im talkin all along
All Miami issues Rozay handle for him
Same way Big Ducky do for me in California
Never slippin got relationships with the trillest niggas
Tony Draper J Prince and every Jimmy Henchmen
Plenty killers and I know that Diddy with it
Tyga chinchilla really aint no penny pinchin
Knew that you would never visit BG
Turk came home take that boy a three piece
Shootin dope usin coke movin like you the Folks
Sacrificin half our life for your new music cult
You would give us self esteem and motivate our drive
But was in our pockets by the time we count to five
I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne
His entire life he gave you what there was to gain
I watched this whole debacle so Im part to blame
Last request can all producers please get paid
Cant believe this shit homie
I still love you nigga
How the fuck nigga you touch half a billion nigga
And your team starvin nigga
You on an island nigga you came to my city nigga
I let you in my city nigga
And what hurt me the most nigga
Is how you did my brother Khaled nigga
Khaled was loyal to you nigga
The pain I seen in my brothers eye nigga
FaceTimin my nigga nigga he took that to the chin nigga
Thats why my nigga blessed
Thats why my nigga Khaled blessed
You put my nigga in the hole homie

Dynasty album track 16 listen scrap
I cant take back that sixteen
Shit the truth spoke I gotta give the world true quotes
Can you feel it I know the truth hurts
They say How can he disrespect his Pop with harsh curses
Simple harsh life harsh verses
I cant believe the mouth of this prick
He said put his mouth on his dick
I know we gotta talk bout that I know you salt bout that
You on the tip like I dont like you
I got four kids three baby mothers Im just like you
Sometimes I want to just fight you shit
Swing on you think Im playing man Im just like you
I was a kid with a puzzle with missing pieces
Trying to put it together dawg you put it together
You made me have to foot through the weather
In the storm with no raincoat
I dont only speak on me I speak upon the kids in the same boat
Riding the same water same situation same fatherless daughter
I hate you thats in your mind dont get caught up in the rhyme
You think I dissed you now that I dont miss you now
Dont be a hater now be glad I made it now
I know I probably rubbed you the wrong way
But fuck what the song say for the record check it
Still got love for you though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone and make it on my own
I still got love for you but I just cant fight the pain
Its so hard not to hate but you grow up in a way
I think you misunderstood me the first time
Listen that was my hurt in my heart talking along with the truth
I would thirst often as a youth cause of you the person
Moms nursing selfesteem issues
Round the house its hard to find a clean tissue minus her tears
To rewind this time I promise Id minus my years
To the day to take the pain away
Seemed sunny outside always rained on Jay
Pop you my umbrella come help your son with the weather
Soon we come together like man and man and build
Play spades cards face up Ive come to deal
In order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
And the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song
Your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn
Your lack of love left me loveless and Im of your breath
Im your mind body and soul your heart your flesh
Your alcohol your smoke it results Im a mess
And Dad still I love you no less Dad
Hope you didnt think success would make me less mad
But not mad just disappointed we wasted years
I swear to God may you take me away from here
If you taught me anything
The one thing you taught me is to face my fears coward
How could you let me grow without you
Grind in this rap game take dough without you
Wear my ProKeds close to the sole without you
Family pictures pose without you
Why Why shouldnt I be mad
Monsters parents separated Monster had his Dad
Bs parents had they problems he still came to the pad
He bought em new bikes imagine what that felt like
Used to have to bump my head to go to sleep at night
Nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong
Lets move on
Still got love for you though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone and make it on my own
I still got love for you but I just cant fight the pain
Its so hard not to hate but you grow up in a way
Still got love for you though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone and make it on my own
I still got love for you but I just cant fight the pain
Its so hard not to hate but you grow up in a way

Ok lets go talk to em holler
Dont you get tired of hearing niggas say that shit all the time
Why cant you shut the fuck up and rhyme nigga
Yeah yeah
Used to run around getting my fight in the streets on
Back in the day before Harlem had a green zone
What good is a good education with no direction
Like the right to vote with no one to vote for in an election
Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
Like a crowd packed in the front without the midsection
Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
I used to live in the back of a holding van
Used to be offbeat like the white girls shoulder dance
I wrote rhymes a acappella no beat behind bars
Shed blood to make it like the story behind scars
I used to be a battle champion in the meanwhile
Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
Prematurely senile underground prima donnas
I was Oliver North during Iran Contra
Cause I never snitched and thats backed by evidence
I learned it by watching you dont ever forget it bitch
Cause everybody knows how the government do
They never snitch on themselves but they want you to snitch on YOU
Evolution from Australopithecus
Primitive commercial shit to hardcore lyricist
Your wax is useless rappers are dropping like Icarus
Technological revolution nigga picture this
Motherfucka what
Yeah
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
Lyrical bullets packed to the top of the clip now
Treat it like a robbery Im shutting this shit down
Fellas put your hands up and the all the women strip down
Thats not misogynist you ostriches cause I could just apocalypse
Talk politics to the populace
Or challenge what the market is
With militant caucuses
Thatll smash the spirit of Hip Hop out the sarcophagus
This is the curse of Tutankhamen I bring the drama on
Im sinful I eat you broad daylight on Ramadan
Hip Hop reparations now we taking back Delucci
Dont tell me you spent it on coke like Danny Bonaduce
Were tired of being on the outside looking in
Wondering what the fuck Hip Hop wouldve been
This is what it is as opposed to what it used to be
And this is your corporate tax ID eulogy
Dominant species the new breed that wont let you breath
Ill make you die for what I believe
So we got nothing in common
There aint no comparison
You got beef with niggas I got beef with Aryans
White power Nazi European Americans
Rapid Poverty pimps and fake vegetarians
The resurrection ripping a ball through the record section
Flight connection to the Chechen border for guerrilla lessons
Fuck a middle man distributor I got a choice now
This aint Volume 1 I got a grown mans voice now
Toured the country four times over Im older and wiser
Poisonous words youll find strychnine in my saliva
motherfucka what Bring it to em raw 
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
50 caliber bullets I dont need a clip now
Fuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down
Bomb wall street and make the stock market dip down
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
You the shit nigga I dont care about shit now
I play the role of Abraham idols get ripped down
Melt the ice caps and make all of this shit drown
No one out there can fuck with me 
motherfucka what 
I speak that real shit 
to smash the airwaves 
I dont want to tell you motherfuckers again

Tell em aint no me
Feel me
Vinny Idol nigga
Streets know the aura Tommy guns fedoras
Watch for the creeps the peeps on the corner
Mommy read Genesis I cred the Torah
Supposed to be righteous but I love the horror
Was thrilled by crime
I cant believe I let a motherfuckin dollar bill kill my mind
Dull my senses steal my shine
It took a strong will from me to heal my mind
Still Im blind cause still I grind
This aint Astrology but feel my sign
Ghost walk his path align feel his rap align
Cause I kick shit that make the pastor cry
Weed pacify or pass the time
Got the soul of a slave with a mastermind
Get real ill make a statue cry
Cause gettin real deep thats a knack of mine
But fuck accolades blow a splif and get kicks off a page
Homie put the MAC away
You either live or you die slow
Might you burn Os and hide dough from 50

Speakin on the patterns in the sky
Niggas make rules up and break em but Im adamant with mine
Catalyst for crime talk shit Im shatterin your spine
Cause I aint get a ladder for the climb
Nah no ropes no hikin shit
Had to play Valhalla on some vikin shit
But never snitch gone on the deal
Live niggas keep it real go out on they shield
No longer doin crime but I could pass a line
Take a couple points hit a joint that is by design
Tradition kept surprised a lotta niggas aint missin yet
Just cause they aint listen yet
I know they deaf but they aint get the vision yet
Who am I to judge
Only robe I wear is from the telly on the balcony
Blowin on the bud
And I aint got a ego I could show a nigga love
I got a Desert Eagle that could show a nigga mud
Dick in the dirt floor wet cause of the blood
To tell the truth nigga I rather give you a hug
And you just mad cause of the plug
I know what it is not what it was

Good afternoon everyone Im Kenny Powers If youre here and youre someone Shane cared about or someone Shane loved Or maybe youre just somebody who has no business being here at all whos just here because you think its gonna make you more popular You know Shane and I used to fuck around big time We fuckin partied hard Wed ride our vehicles around Slay ass
My condolences my condolences
Whole family in mourning send my condolences
My condolences crazy I just spoke to him
Courtney dropping drinks all in Hooters
She losin focus shit
Dont send a text I dont care yall mad
Shit I waited 5 days nigga where yall at
For real Im calling Stunna
Cause all Summer 16 aint heard a hot 16 bout all Summer
Awareness is high say attention Im seeking
Since Im reaching its offensive theyre convinced Im a demon
Such a thin disagreement son my kin for a reason
Killing you is expected of me I dont win an achievement
Somebody pinch me Im dreaming take this mental reprievement
Since I know the nigga I know this aint the man that Im seein
I heard it straight from the Bamas mouth he wont pull a hammer out
Wasnt you at Hovs show scared to pull the camera out
Im seeing habits switch magic tricks
You froggy behind that Apple fix
The passiveness in your manner I might react to it
Automatic shit
Ratchet kids at your crib that cant even spell Calabasas bitch
So I take all the guns load half the clips
I just notice you run we mention half the Clipse
Ill save that for another time Ill get back to it
Im kinda shocked to look at what weve advanced to
Knew itd get you dismantled knew the issues I ran through
Sick of the scandal or maybe I just misunderstand you
I kept it a buck thought that that was shit you could handle
You said that you wondered if anything you doin was brand new right
I got him no one help father punch below the belt
Introspection means dig deep lets look below the wealth
I wanna know myself
How you tell bitches know they self
When you dont even know yourself
You wouldnt know yourself
Say he Canadian maybe Asian Croatian
Be sounding like his Jamaican friends depend on what state he in
I think you rap good but you a movie star
So that owls appropriate we dont know who you are
Where did the boys brain change Was it the club scene
Now you sound like you use people and love things
But later for how you use people and love things
The entendres that upswing when I call you drug king
That record contract leaves a lot to exam
Never dealt drugs in his life but sold a lotta gram
Thats too much baking soda good thing my break is over
They thinking cause my paper lower this for Rage to blow up
Or maybe they just woke up
You leverage your celeb taking waves over
Thats territorial takeover
Maybe he thinks nobody notices
Gucci wasnt home two seconds before you rode his dick
Bodied Versace flows copy that he stole
Ay dios mio sorry Migos adios amigo
Was that your plot all along
Why you aint do that vid with Fetty but you hopped on the song
No really we want a Party album
But you keep stealing all of Partys album
To go and put it on your party album
Its plenty reason to slay you
Kept going up Tuesdays and now The Weeknd just hates you
Are you lifeless Sound like a zombie on the track
Remember Started From the Bottom it was Zombie on the Track
Know who else started from the bottom Zombie on the Track
How come after that joint I dont see Zombie on a track
Im from Jersey so Zombie I got your back
Be alarmed the real is finally back
Get your guard up now hope your heart up now
Battery in him lets see if he get charged up now
Im wake
Im wake
We at the wake
Whos Goose and whos Tom Cruise
Well now that Shane is dead I guess we know who is Goose Shane is Goose Cause in that motion picture Goose dies so Shane is dead so he would be Goose

Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
Yes the hours four I told you before
Prepare for mic fights and plus the cold war 
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Quran
It blows extreme mainstream be the theme supreme team
Americas Cream Team redeemed
Vidal Sassoon chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Fullfledged sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords hanging like umbilical
Cords dope swords five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational hand held tote mhm
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
A hundred thousand times one snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title and heres how my belt was won check it
Slick majestic broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me the kids nice and he holds swords
And his name black attacks the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck you cant destroy this
You get ambushed skate try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son dipped in black
My culture glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
Yes the hours four I told you before
Prepare for mic fights and plus the cold war 
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily calm and deadly
Spatterhead lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bearhugging mics with the grips of a python
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause I prolong
Extravaganza time sits still
No propaganda be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre murder to cassette
I blow the shop up you aint seen nothing yet
One man ran tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on watch me acometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause like a black dat to dat
Youre stuck on stupid like Im stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers cant stop O
In battling you dont want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause yall snakes keep rattling
Bitch you aint got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All yall crab bitches aint got to worry
Cant get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if Im smoked out I cant be scoped out
Im too ill I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 917
16049311
And you could get long dick hiphop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
Im Staten Island best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire is USSR
PLO style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine cant define my style is so deep
Like pussy my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit you know Im friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power born physically power speaking
The truth in the song be the problack teaching

I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive I never felt so alive 
I never felt so alive I never felt so alive 
Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you catch me
Ive fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I aint even tryna fight it
Dont wanna die Dont wanna die no more 
Cause now youre here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying baby
Ill dry your eyes
Ill dry your eyes
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11s
You read me like a book like Im the Bible you the Reverend
Yeah I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons Im this way
I would like to paint a picture but itll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall thats stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father and the passing of my peers
While Im too scared to expose myself
It turns out you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how bout that
She gets him you get me 
She hugs him you kiss me 
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you I believe you
She gets him you get me 
She hugs him you kiss me 
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you I believe you
Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you catch me
Ive fallen in love for the first time

Drug Somalians pollying
Mittens raps they crocheting
Ayo Iron these niggas portraying

For real slide on these niggas like a fresh pair
Caesar fade style usually tuck grenade
Throw a blade fuck getting laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Day to day Wallies half leather halfsuede
Connecting with the high stylist dun
Light up a chalice
I run with nothing but the wildest foulest
Come on now longdick style
Niggas on the hit out ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually bust a rap gun mentally
Been doing this a century kid just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin off white BM
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Palladium style play it like thirtytwo Arabians
The greatest lesson is dont owe you might get stole on
When I go bury me with velour on
They come to me and understand just let me get mines first Then after I
Get mines yall can do what yall wanna do Fuck em up bad
Sho nuff hit the Bank and thrust
Wu Nauticas Jamie Sommer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade swallow raw eggs read the label
Hitting whitelabel left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailing walked in my Earth start kneeling
Started stealing Im too ill see were grilling at the parlay
Kicked up mack max motion
Michael Bolton magazine quote Im too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap
Fuck benadryl the violin in Knowledge God sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious no blotches
My telephone watchll leave bartenders topless
Dead arm the prosecutor smack the juror
Me and my girlll run like Luke and Laura

Sipping mixed drinks out of broke coconut bowls we wilding
Sit back jollyin ahha ahha ahha ahha

Drug Somalians pollyin
Sit back jollyin
My team be gamin like three card Rolly an
Drug Somalians pollyin
Sit back
Deep meditation sound orientated war the blizzard
Rap paramedical the wizard
Cappadonna never catering to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You order five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowing with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of wilding Park Hill profiling
I cut your face a Buck 50 sure why you smiling
For violating my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person itd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause Im PLO TKO every day
Dancehall General Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna sona old school Disco Inferno
Veteran for rapping with the new set of Wu the hard rapping
Ninetysix jive I keep the live crowd clapping
When I bow all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evening I have a by myself meeting
Thinking whos gonna be the next to catch a beating
From my mental slanging bitching rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize all competition catch hell here
Chance him thats what they said threw up a ransom
I jacked it stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards
The way I the way I wanna get em I want em gotten I want em layin
Out I want em gotten Cause niggas need to be got He need to be
Taken off of here Thats right

352,"On the mic at this time in the place to be
Im the Inhuman Orchestra called Biz Markie
That made you dance make the music with my mouth and all
But Im here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
Where I can be found if youre lookin
For me the Biz so just come check me out
Cause 247 Im mikin the house
So when I come in the Mall and then I start to roam
You wouldnt think its a store you would think its my home
Cause when I come in the place then I hang up a sign
Reads Home sweet home this house is mine
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I been to many malls from state to state
But Ive never been in say one this great I hate
To say about the other shopping centers thats left
But the Albee Square Mall is the doodoodef
I be in there everyday walkin around chillin
From when they opened all the way until when
Its about time for the place to close
Im just running things like a pair of panty hose
They all know me the Biz Markie
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in every store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
If I could move in party people I just might
So I could stay forever and it wont be just like
A bum that you see sleepin on a park bench
So how will it be when you see Biz Markie
I fade them all been havin fun
See to me this mall is like number one
And any other shoppers there that try to compare
There aint no way they could hang out with Albee Square
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I step in the place and shop around for a while
Buy some jewelry for Treny and Ali and after that Ill
Go take a stroll inside of Gibbs Pups
Then buy some fresh silks Ballys too
Next stop Olympic wanted to buy some sneakers
Then hit the Game Room to pick me up a Cesar
Stroll around with a fly female
While securitys riffin about leanin on the rail
After that I go eat some food at Wendys
In the Albee cafeteria could be shoppin plenty
From store to store just stuffin face
And I do the pfrronetwo while sayin my grace
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
Never use a quarter cause I got a calling card
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
Thats where I be until the day is done
Just coolin in the place thats number one
So next time youll be in Brooklyn walkin around
Play like Price Is Right and come on down
And
Go shoppin
Go shoppin
Go shop lets all go shoppin 3x 
Go shoppin
Go shoppin
Go shoppin Swan and Biz go shoppin
Lalalala
Lalalalalala till end

3285,"Ahh todays narrator the Ghost ha ha ha ha ha
This is a true story ladies and gentlemen
You might not believe it though
But fuck it thats why Im the ghost
Im about to open up listen
One day I fell asleep and my knife woke me up
He said Your gun is in the closet flippin
Talkin bout I get the most action he about to soak me up
So I went to the closet said Hammer whats wrong with you
You aint busting me off its like I dont belong to you
I said I just beat a case daddy
And Im tryna take it easy cause I gotta move this weight daddy
Then the hammer said Man listen use the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin
Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together tell me if its now or never
I said Hammer take it easy baby
Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy baby
And all you gotta do is chill a while
And then the hammer said Cool cause you know that I feel you Styles
I got a story to tell my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell my hammer talk to me
But nobody believe that my hammer talk to me
I got a story to tell my haze talk to me
But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell my money talk to me
But nobody believe that my money talk to me
My knife said to me
I hawk niggas down bust arteries 
And he get bright red for me
Knife you my nigga but leave me alone
I got to talk to my man haze to get in the zone
I said Haze what the hell is up
He said You know how we do you know that we crew
So wheres the vanilla dutch
Rollin somethin up
Think about killin every rapper in the game and holdin somethin up
My haze said to me You need to calm down when the rage come to you
Fore a grave or a cage or a gauge come to you
But you dont give a fuck
So just open up your book and let your page come to you
Even though Im humble and noble I dont give a fuck
You aint tryna hear me Ima shoot through your mobile
Its funny yall squabble
Hold up my niggas it aint a convo less your money start talkin


I got a story to tell my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell my hammer talk to me
But nobody believe that my hammer talk to me
I got a story to tell my haze talk to me
But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell my money talk to me
But nobody believe that my money talk to me
My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasnt for his ass there wouldnt be no hope for me
Money aint everything and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit Im the reason why the block jumpin
Let a nigga try to stop something DBlockll pop somethin
And Im the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side shoot niggas in the eye
I said Money you the root of evil
How they print In God We Trust knowin what you do to people
But Im a hard felon
So I grabbed two stacks dirty and bloody cause I heard my car yellin
I got a story to tell my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell my hammer talk to me

Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you
Catch me Ive fallen in love for the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit on this bus I sit
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin me wantin me givin me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin me
Handcuffs keep huggin the wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they cant afford
Even with the discount write a check that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit it dont matter the amount
We just swipin shit here we dont love we just likin shit here
Whats that smell Wheres your diaper shit here
Lay on your back dont pee right now
Or else Ill have to get you back
One day when you gon want to get your way
Yeah Ill have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I aint never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking
Am I worthy of this gift
Am I strong enough to lift Am I strong enough to lift 
Into a place that I can see Into a place that I can see 
Someone more important than me Someone more important than me 
Am I worthy of this gift Am I worthy of this gift 
Am I strong enough to lift Am I strong enough to lift 
Into a place that I can see Into a place that I can see 
Someone more important than me Someone more important than me 
Ib gon ask me how I did this shit
Im gon do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made
Shes mine Catch me dont you
Shes mine Catch me dont you
Shes mine Catch me
Ive fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry and I aint even tryna fight it
Dont wanna die cause now youre here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin baby
I dry your eyes I dry your eyes
There is a God it is a God

2698,"Look somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow silk sheets and a satin pillow
This California king loved you like a sack of indo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos
Master suite frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like a blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
Know wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just dont look down at your feet
Look
Told this world I was a star Im gon need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
We used to be respected now they laughin
Weve turned into possessions with no passion
How we go from the best to less than average
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
With no collective identity 
You You You You
Its every man for himself 
Me Me Me Me
We need a black mafia 
Us We We
Look 
Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit
I think too much TV is what ruins kids
When homosexual actors is their influences
We need community centers that teach the music biz
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit
Dont take no hand outs you build it its more lucrative
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit
You get abused long enough you start abusing shit
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way
He shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
No separation 
Who Who Who Who
You You You You
Divide and conquer 
Me Me Me Me
Its the Art of War 
Us We We
Who detached us
Look 
Death is the destination we all share No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Lifes change agent It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life
Dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking
Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition They somehow already know what you truly want to become Everything else is secondary
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
It was their farewell message as they signed off
And now I wish that for you
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
",that I spoke is the truest shit You get abused long enough you start abusing shit She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch You got some problems in the house that only you can fix And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way He shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray Now every second is a classic when nothing last Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that This world is turning faster and faster And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit I need some answers to these questions that Im asking We used to be connected who detached us Who Who Who Who No separation Who Who Who Who You You You You Divide and conquer Me Me Me Me Its the Art of War Us We We Who detached us Look Death is the destination we all share No one has ever escaped it And that is as it should be because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life It is Lifes change agent It clears out the old to make way for the new Right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life Dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition They somehow already know what you truly want to become Everything else is secondary Stay Hungry Stay Foolish It was their farewell message as they signed off And now I wish that for you Stay Hungry Stay Foolish,Look somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead Divorced the street she tried to kill me and my wife to be Black widow silk sheets and a satin pillow This California king loved you like a sack of indo Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos Master suite frigerator full of incidentals Every day we have a ball like a blond bimbo Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho And it can be as simple as it seems If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see Know wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream You could walk on water just dont look down at your feet Look Told this world I was a star Im gon need a stage Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray Now every second is a classic when nothing last Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that This world is turning faster and faster And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit I need some answers to these questions that Im asking We used to be connected who detached us We used to be respected now they laughin Weve turned into possessions with no passion How we go from the best to less than average We used to be connected who detached us Who Who Who Who With no collective identity You You You You Its every man for himself Me Me Me Me We need a black mafia Us We We Look Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit I think too much TV is what ruins kids When homosexual actors is their influences We need community centers that teach the music biz That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit Dont take no hand outs you build it its more lucrative And now everything
2399,"Young Black Intelligent YBI Lyrics
Young black intelligent this is not a first
But it feels like its curse and it weighs like a elephant
Heavy on my mind cause I feel so irrelevant
Heavy on my heart its like Im smart for the hell of it
Heavy on my soul its our stroll through the ville again
Stranded on this island feel like Im Gilligan
Friends got jailed and then they got bailed
Stress that Im under I just wonder when they kill again
Please understand that Im living in the concrete
Jungle where I stumble is the crumble under my feet
In the building lobby see my man Bobby
Puffing on a joint thats the point where our eyes meet
Asked whats the weight on the books in my knapsack
Hes so amused Im confused why he asked that
Then I understand the motive and the plan
Hes trying to be the man while I stand getting laughed at
Dudes got jokes but very little hopes
Thats why they trying to bring me down like a halfback
But I got balanced my moms made a promise
If I get the grades Ill be praised like Thomas
Clarence but I dont know if laws in my future
Cops in the war and theyll sure try to shoot ya
All I wanna do is get a B in geometry
Lose my virginity and live my life drama free sing
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I why be I
Why be me why be me
If I fly if I fly
They gon see  they gon see
I might die I might die
But Ill be free but Ill be free
So why be I why be I
Why be me why be me

Young Black
Penny for your thoughts a nickel for your dreams
A dime for your goals and a quarter in your jeans
Trying to make a dollar outta fortyone cents
Caught up in the barbed wire shorty on the fence
I can be a knifepacking guntoting hooligan
But I cant decide so Im on my way to school again
On my way to duel again me against the world
But all I can think about is me against a girl
Youthful exuberance busting at the seams
Look at all the other kids cussing at the deans
Looking at all the other kids cutting 8th period
But Im on a team and my coach wont hear of it
Hes well aware of it I aint getting pinched
Yall dummies go ahead I aint getting benched
Whole lot of right and a little bit of wrong
And everything youve worked for Gone
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I why be I
Why be me why be me
If I fly if I fly
They gon see  they gon see
I might die I might die
But Ill be free but Ill be free
So why be I why be I
Why be me why be me

Young Black
In this state of emergency and sense of urgency
Just how young is young
Cause the youth be not youth for long
Young society might be afraid of you
But you continue to be you
We are you so we feel you
For that those that see you
We salute you
Continue to find like minds brah
Design your inside concentration desire
Dedication inspiration perspiration
Is the hard work
Doesnt guarantee anything
But without it you dont stand a chance
Intelligence will save you
And us too
Peace

685,"I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a 100 the Game spit 3 I said Fuck it
Ima have to show these niggas something
Too easy whod believe me if I said that it wasnt
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didnt think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said Nobody benefits everyone perishes
I tell them this they say Here its time for your medicine
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to 44 4s 22 times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lying
You like red or white wine Lets talk about it Im buying
Lets talk about the Children of Zion excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming Ive mastered it certainly surely
Ill celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it dont coagulate
The sex magik wont work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor more than a rapper
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour then a taser then a laser
Then a maser then a phaser then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why Coup de grce for the coup dtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think Ive had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off I promise you well just talk
No biting allowed just bark dont run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought thought manifests words actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
Im a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself then how would I be
If I do not look tell me how will I see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still cant recognize myself
I dont need anybody but myself
When Im rhyming like this I dont need no help
But thank you for your purchase these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy you wanna be the best you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield ED Fields
Chew MCs like Im eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
Its no use if you cant use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone numbers placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it I dont wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress shes an actress
This is Monster Ball practice Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I dont care if were not the same colour nigga Im your brother
I dont care what you say nigga you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind waves bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing where are you Are you hiding
No I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so Tell the people they need to know
And if you dont think so youre a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say Im crazy I say So tell me something I dont know
Something my psyche profile doesnt show
I dont have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus Answer me
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out No do not go
Where the fuck are you going
400mph wind belts blowing think for a moment
We got to wait it out thats what the trainings about
We have to survive thats what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing
Tough pliable relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I cant rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasnt been made yet
Cause I havent been paid yet not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating I tried to save them they wasnt patient
Responsibility entrusted
Theres only one way for me to prove that I love it thats why Im busting
If you pursue revenge dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that youve made
Musically still producing I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureates my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it concentrate you can hear it
Ive almost perfected this Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you cant forget
Oprah Winfrey dont like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably dont like black
I dont blame her she dont understand its only entertainment
She probably wouldnt feel different if she wasnt famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist if not racist with colour
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon not the sigil this is for real though
I sit down and think when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God even Im stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead thats not fair
Who I talk to Go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
I procured a small piece of the treasure collections from a former era
Dating back to forever the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law I dont govern them
I summon them speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet woodwinds strings
The conductor brings the drums in finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance Hip Hop justice rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered liars are denied water you still alive
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary patrolling the open seas at UBoat speed
Beneath the Tsunami where Im supposed to be
Industrialists civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Cosigned by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding lyrics timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it its going to have a word with me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this theres no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieris Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit whos ready
Ill need a volunteer do I have any
Next year Ill get my SPINGS a master space badge
After that Ill stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devils chamber
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The leaders lies got me reassigned my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
Im a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
Well shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like theres a bus up the street
The Dr and I would meet at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health killing myself
Rebuilding myself nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill getting more ill
The woman who is there she will take care of you
With Nexium Avodart Lipitor and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second One answer per session
Hip Hop made me Hip Hop praise me
Aint nothing changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy battle me baby
1000 Bars nigga after that maybe
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians I do it for the soldiers
Raptors Comanches Strykers Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fighting the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where we gon go
Starving in destitution dying for retribution
Why would you wanna blow a hospital You stupid
Why would you not force yourself to make better music
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot 4 ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor I see excitement coming
I raise my hand lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say were divided I say were small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
783 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
1000 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary but tell me whos the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when Im touring
Acupuncture point or plus is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute or debate
My face is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing from the other side it looks like its opening
Where am I trying to go with this
Fire and Ash fallout thats what its all about
We must construct a shelter and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but

This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But Im unprepared to take action just like you

The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause Im familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said let it be written let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere

In front of me on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me 60
Sitting down at the mixing boardroundbanquet table comfortably
They begin to study me by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely I rose I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell

The sickness spit with conviction promote lyrical fitness
Im lost what version is this
Mozart with a flowchart putting together parts of an unknown art
But coming from my own heart
Burning a disk initializing rhyming and visualizing
Reaching 1000 Bars and climbing
Martial Law Research an all expense paid trip to the dirt
Several miles deep underneath the Earth
The Boston Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
Extraordinary men who meet to review and recommend
I attend the Gubernatorial that never ends 190
We just got a SASO we call this one the Black Hole
Im glad Im the last to go
Zionism the answer to your uncensored question
Guy de Rothschild and his bloodline brethren
Playing the guitar singing folk songs speaking my mind
Nobody could really understand the reason I rhyme
Infrared direct hit target bled proceed to inject the syringe with meds
That subsequently pinch your leg
You feel like your an inch from being dead
But you alive instead youre really dead your just living in my head
Fire for effect smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation roll out like this
I will spare no sin walk in with a scarecrow grin looking crazy
Cause thats what you made me
Classified payloads with no frequency safe modes no safety
And I still made time for the ladies
Ceiling visibility unlimited
A lyricist river fish surrounded by nigga shrimp
Im a killer pimp
Somebody Hip Hop dont need me
Nigga I grew up in DC I love Lil Weezy 210
Me and Baby got the same name
We probably got the same blood in our veins liquid propane
At the top of the Temple Mount Mosque I look at the Sun
I just have a few words for everyone
Everybody bow your heads and say this prayer
From this moment Hip Hop is united everywhere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history

1327,"Its been a long time
Since I hit you with freestyle
High tech selections
From the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back relax
And watch as I melt wax
Dont ever let a brother like me
Write a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocal tone
Its mine have motherfuckers
Rushing to rewind
Cause Ill flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the suns up
Cause it really aint
How much you say
Its what you say
I got no fucking time on the mic
To play
I write rhymes
With addition and algebra
Mental geometry
Dont even come at me
Talking that weak and
Popping that bullshit
Get out my face
A fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters
Said it couldnt be done by me
Them same suckers
Are now looking from under me
Wondering what I did
I didnt play myself kid
I respected my fans
And made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes
At night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen
And place it on some loose leaf
Nothing soft always the tough meat
The white paper and
Blue lines excite my mind
Not allowing me to stop the rhyme
Until the whole motherfucking
Books complete
Then I write on the
Back of the sheets
I made a promise
To my brothers in street crime
Wed get paid with the use
Of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together
Made the tracks clever
Now were checking
More bank than ever
Mind over matter
So you gotta have mind power like the fellas say 
Mind over matter
Mind power 
I can drop rhymes in twos
And threes and fours
And still have much shit
Left for encores
Cause once my mind locks
In on a dope idea
Motherfucking ducks
Should stand clear
Cause Im a hit the topic point blank
Its jail ya better keep your shank
Cause I got mine
And Im out on a solo creep
Uggga Your face hits the concrete
You wanna roll
With the niggas that dont play
I think you got false courage
Get out my damn way
Cause the car Im in
Is rolling full of men
Not kids or boys E got the Mac 10
Islams got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin to
Hook the fucking track up
Syndicates making the move
With the ski masks
And Im housing the long cash
So now you realize
You underestimated the Ice
You thought that I was OK
But now you realize Im nice
But thats alright
Cause I knew Id make it in the end
Those who like me now
Might not have liked me then
But Imma keep impressing
Stressing my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessing
Armor plate my mind
With walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields
I can understand 
Mind over matter
I know what it means 
Mind power 
Mind over matter
Mind over matter 
Mind over matter
Mind over matter 
Mind over matter
Mind over matter 
Wise up
Move to the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you trying to prove
VUs max as Evil E
My nigga dogs the wax
My brains a hand grenadecatch
Imma hit you with an overload
Of bottomless thought
Reversing all the shit youre taught
Then throw words at you
Syllableatatime
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do
The powers over you
When you sleep
Youll be saying these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power
To control all
Think positive
Youll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell
Thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
Ill say I want a million
My mind is so deep
Ill be busting a check for it next week
I can understand 
Mind over matter
I know what it means 
Mind power 
Mind over matter
Mind over matter 
Mind over matter
Mind over matter 
Mind over matter

Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest its kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one the homies never came to see me
Suspect two Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldnt see me
Theres usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night Im like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
Im cool with taking mine but I took other niggas gunshots
Chest wide open Im tryna fight but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me cause I shot them
But who set me up I aint tripping but

467,"I did it again huh Yeah I know
Im writing you a song though
It goes something like this
You said one love you cant unlove
I dont know what it is youre trying to run from
Like you just you tryna unfriend me in real life
I want it all real nothing fake please
I dont want to wonder what your handshake means
I dont need to say everything I think I must
My egos trying to ruin everything I touch
What I mean though or what my point is
That youre much more important than my point is
If I win an argument and lose your heart Lord
Hit the bullseye on the wrong dart board
Want to thank everyone for being patient with me
Its a journey that Im on I pray you take it with me
And to quote myself thats what this is about
We live learn and figure it out
Oh my God now
It aint easy when its real
Just dont leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It aint easy when its real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it
I want the real love not the false kind
Not the one that need perfectness at all times
When it seems most difficult to keep me close
Is probably the time that I need you most
I let you down though I didnt mean to
Even the people who try we get weak too
And when you said we were family I believed you
Because I needed so bad for it to be true
Now is my heart that way Would I try to betray
Is there any such thing as an honest mistake
If what you need and what I have dont match
Thats when we need the love thing to fill those gaps up
It aint easy when its real
Just dont leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It aint easy when its real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it
You tryna save the world right 
Yo Im a hot mess and if Im honest
Its not just one event but a process
If Im tryna get out here and protest
Let me first save the world from my foolishness
Let me guard my heart from its harshness
Try to rid my truth of its falseness
If your beauty is closer than an arms length
Youd be hard pressed to tell me that its far fetched
I know I hurt you though you took it personal
But whats love if the essence isnt merciful
And I see no need for us to live with regrets
Id rather just forgive and forget
Oh my God now
It aint easy when its real
Just dont leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It aint easy when its real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it
I was thinking maybe not debate politics in the pool
Nah just because its your daughters birthday party I just You know
No I feel you
Yeah word up email me about that
You said one love cant unlove
I dont know what you think youre tryna run from
You said one love cant unlove tryna run from
Said one love love love
Said one love love love
Said one love love love

304,"Its mine its all mine you understand
At least me and my peoples
Can you dig that
21st century thought Id never see it
Right around the corner baby
Ours for the takin
Yo
Ive seen child blossom to man
Some withered and turned to murderers
Led astray by the liars death glorifiers observin us
Watching us close marketing host is here to purchase
Purposely overtaxin the earnings
Nervous burnin down the churches
Theyre scared of us rather beware than dare to trust
Throw us in jail million dollar bail left there to rust
Lets call in order give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin my own Im livin alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan you go girl
Shes an exception some people can leap to the impression
See me myself I start flippin and fall victim to deep depression
Im stressin the issue here so we can gross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin fired and hired as a pistoleer
Theres no longevity livin off negativity
Fuck it Id rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
Thats how the city be everybody gettin they hustle on
Judge singin death penalty like its his favorite fuckin song
Word is bond takin my life you know they lovin it
God F the government and its fuckin capital punishment
Capital punishment given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin with
Cant live alone watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin the llello for life the rightful heir to the throne
We come from Kings and Queens people with dreams Gods and Earths
For what its worth we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First its turnin tables open our own labels
Disable the Republicans then reverse capital punishment
Ive seen it all up close shit out the movies youd be buggin
My cousin Chuchi barely a juve lost it and turned on the oven
He wasnt playin blew out the flame and started inhalin
Baring a secret too deep to keep on the street for sharin
Wearin the virus Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff blow your head off fuck a snuff we bust lead off
Get off your high horse or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohicans The Last of the PoRicans
We need some unity fuck all the Jeeps and jewelry
The maturity keeps me six feet above obscurity
The streets are deadly and everybodys a desperado
I guess tomorrow aint promised unless youre Amish and deaths your motto
Like Zorro I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z but a P cause Punishments what I resemble
I lend you this if it expands yours for you and yours
A real man cant fall he stands tall
The Mans claws are diggin in my back Im tryin to hit him back
Time to counteract where my niggas at
Capital punishment given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin with
Cant live alone watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin the llello for life the rightful heir to the throne
We come from Kings and Queens people with dreams
Gods and Earths
For what its worth we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First its turnin tables open our own labels
Disable the Republicans then reverse capital punishment
You like that its Pun and Prospect
We hold nines own more treasure than gold mines makin progress
With Don Juans theres rules to be made crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid nothin yall can do to behave
We laid in the slums made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government tryin to take out our sons
Rudy Gulliani trying to blind me but I see reality
Was raised with the street mentality
My strategys why my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise so I would never fall to the lies
Its no surprise but do or die if you want the glamour
Yeah I want the glamour laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta
While Cubans smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer in the palm never shaky calm handlers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade then the night back to day
Like the twentyfour hour rotation
I know the location its just a little information
From the Squad bringing the Terror for the nineera
And let it rain on your fine leather nigga what

Like


I said I gotta use the bathroom
You wanna come inside
Yeah I guess
Dont stress
You aint going outside
What a night
Look at her light
Her aura not free
I can kinda feel the heat
Now Im low in the seat
Open the door
She offers me her couch and some water
Normal hospitality
I figure that Ill order
Acknowledging acceptance
Seems her space is well kept
And she looks I look away
Starts to chuckle
Then expects
a moment
Her with ease
Yo shes such a cool breeze
That its actually disarming
Im not Jay or Prince Charming
Just a bit unchic
And a little too unique
On top of being really cool
Yo you know she really sweet
And the CD player runs
A familiar tune we hum
Then she tells me that its 8
Of course she compliments her day
Starts to move a little closer
Aint no room here on the sofa
Starts to move in
Let me lose this silly grin
Damn
Hey you you are so cool to me
I got a whole on my mind
And I wonder why youre here with me

481,"Im home
Uh yeah
They always ask me 
Ali what you so angry for man Why you always so upset 
I tell em Shit theres a thin line between anger and hunger my man
And I ride a unicycle down the middle you might catch me touchin feet down on both sides 
Ever since day number one its just me and where Im coming from
Rites of Passage and Shadows on the Sun
My people I stand before you As a man with more true shit
Than he knows what to do with
I give it all to you long as you can promise me this
When its time you will ball up a fist like this 
Me and Anthony we fill all the gaps in
And are proud of what we make regardless what happens
Fuck rappin I sing off key
One thing you should never do is dis Ali
Cause motherfucker there aint nothin rougher
Then tryin to climb from the rug you get swept under
I can run through every one of your blunders
Mistake number one is that your crew dont love ya
Ill take a bullet for the core of the Sayers
When me and my dogs out tourin the nation
I spit with an intensity you have to witness
Look close my blood on the back of the tickets
Its that religious its what I teach my son
How to read the Quran and how a party is won
We like Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We selftaught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We selftaught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
When line meets mine we bend ya girls spine
Figureeight status she got back for days
The same old magic will not crack the maze
The lights changed since we anted up pot has been raised
And Im fucking with the hand I was dealt
Live twentyfive years to experience what Lazarus felt
If you drop three crumbs Ill eat one
Feed one to the family restll get invested in my freedom
I battle through carton of shit
With a wrist full of broken tooth picks tryin to carve out a niche
You can either choose the heart or the fist but you will connect with me
If your path ever intersect with me
The fire in the eye could never be held back its the same 
Pressure that made the liberty bell crack its the same 
Pressure that made my brother E sell crack in the name 
Quran holy Rest in Peace
My back is bein watched by the only one on high
We stride in the party hoods up crossed eyes
Broke as what but dont give a fuck
Cause I feel I got the world by the nuts Uhh
We like Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Homeboy understand I aint mad at you
Theres just very few things in life I know how to do
And this is one of them right here
And whatever comes up comes out
We dont put our hands on our mouths I stand for what Im about
Unknown but Im still a soldier
Cant let em go home till I win em over
My youth was training its very clear
Every year new city new rules to play with true shit 
New kid in school didnt rule nothin
To this day I rap like Im trying to prove something
Little bit aggressive when I spit a sentence
Till you get the message
You couldnt pay me to quit professin
Rock sixtyone sold out shows came home and caught a bus to the
Sixtysecond
Shirt sweated full of work ethic
Been in love with the shit since I first met it
Rhymesayers is the first to come last to leave
Aint no tricks up our sleeve this is what we believe
We like Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught its as real as you make it

But in my brain I stay insane and Im always on some other shit
Really wanna fuck a bitch EB cant get enough of this
See me take what I stuck her with then I gotta run and give it to another chick
Gutter trick suck a dick State the texture of a brick
Making them Magnum rubbers split what a prick the brothers sick
Now back to my love like to go there
Even when its annoying like long nose hair
I can so share my heart in the cold air
And its no fair the size of it is so rare
Bloody murder muddy word of wretched death rhymes
Take me light and my darkness will take your breath time
Call me Chakratease or you can call me Tech N9ne
But since I found my new sinister out of respect Im

Liberate me Lord

I was sent from above but Ive landed in blood
Psycho bandit Ive become a frightful damage and scuffed
Missile you Mitchells are misinformed and mixed in the middle of my menace
Murderous Michael Myers my mimic
Mom you made a monster Im making minions in minutes
Money motivated mishap asmodeus monikers mended
Feel like Im on Molly heart as big as my body
When a hottie gets naughty its racing like a Ferrari
My obese heart swelling when it beats hard telling me
To freak not willing like a beast Im yelling
Bloody murder muddy word of wretched death rhymes
Take me light and my darkness will take your breath time
Call me chakratease or you can call me Tech N9ne

Horse shit piss and human puke is this smell
To whom ever wondered my level this is hell
Inside my crown I kill a gangster with fecies pig tail
And Ill live a 137 years like Ishmael

2878,"I cant be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow so that my core follows
We dont mourn for the dead nigga we pour bottles
Drown sorrows ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother Nigga Ill be damned
Gator at my mommas house welcome to zombie land
A hustlers paradise a lucky pair of dice
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didnt bat an eye I at it kept the poker face
Cause the batter I add had the coca base
When you get to heavens door they wont hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smokers face
Theres no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and youre four wheeling right
You know youre up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
Im a wizard at it nigga heres the magic
Make a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic
Yes My God
The Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here so Ill need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say they feel it but say it hurts
No pain no gain nigga
They say Im heating up welcome to the flame nigga
No matter the success still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came nigga
Aerodynamic roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price cash under handed
The 012 a year early Im a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
Theyll be no waiting I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
Im here now nigga pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
Its the new god flow aint it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth get reacquainted

661,"Word up
Yo what up This is Canibus about to black out
Representin Group Home shout out to Lost Boyz Def Squad
Charles Suitt Mr Sexx DJ Clue and Desert Storm
Lets drop it
Haha Hoo Canibus freestyle niggas know Clue
Yo I speak at frequencies dogs would have trouble hearin
Canibus is the lyrical version of German engineering
Raw metaphors keep you high for months
Fly around the Earth twice without refuelin once
Aint too many categories I can fit in when it come to spittin
Cause Im overqualified for the position
The laserguided lyrical hybrid
Creatin scripts so sick I gotta armwrestle my pen to write it
Dont get excited cause if I ever catch one of you wannabes bitin
Were gonna be fistfightin
So motherfuckers what you want I got the shotgun pumped
You feel like a frog nigga Then jump
I posses the lyrical ammo to battle
And rip any one of you warmblooded mammals to shambles
I make examples of you and eat a mouth full of ya crew
The type of MC you cant outdo
Ill battle you on the net Ill battle you in the flesh
Ill battle you over the phone you can call me collect
Ill battle you for the respect Ill battle you over a blank cheque
Ill battle you with a gun to my neck
Ill battle you standin over the toilet with my dick out
Ill battle you jugglin a hand grenade with the pin out
In a stolen car with the VIN number ripped out
Drinkin a Guinness Stout doin a 360 spinout
I stay righteous like Farrakhan puffin on the marijuan
You understand where Im comin from
You number one Then Im negative two
Basically nigga that means Im still better than you
Basic mathematics the verbal mechanics of rhymin
Behold I crush a piece of coal and create a diamond
On the microphone Im sicker than those
Whove AcquiredImmuneDeficiencySyndromes
And every word I utter for hiphop lovers
Will reflect forever like two mirrors facin each other
The baddest MOther FUcker
Let me break the style down so you dont have to wonder
I walk the BLock with GLock COcked
Tryin to get the DROp on the COps
Blow spots capsize boats shipwreck yachts
Headshots hit you at 300 nautical knots
You callin the cops complainin about the hiphop
Gettin Benjamins like The LOX it dont stop
Eheh eheh put away your burners you cant serve us
My whole camp is allergic to bein murdered
Metaphors is proof I got more than just a couple screws loose
Latinos call me the Black Jess
So for all who believe the telekinesis of Jesus
I touch a paraplegic and heal him

Tie em up for the fact that Im kickin ass
I got my hand on my gat and Im tempted to blast
My name is Eazy but I go the hard way out
This aint personal but now Im about
To commit a crime and go through it
You know what no need for shaking because Im used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah hes wearing a badge but hes a old ass man
Pop his ass in the head and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know so me and my gang just cant be seen
Lock the doors and throw away the key
Close the blinds so no motherfuckers could see
And smile you know cause Im controling of the shit
And no sucker ass niggas gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs and a Ruthless shirt
That means Im ready to work and rush a fool to the dirt so
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Alright anybody move and Ill blow your fucking head off
Alright empty your pockets but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fucking floor
Dont make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
Im in a bank and its a little bit funny
Taking all you stupid motherfuckers money
Peepin at a bitch cause my dicks on hard
Laughing at the dumbass security guard
Whos tied up for the moment not saying a word
I should have known it before the motherfuckers a nerd
But back to the bitches Im peepin
And then untie the hoe so I can start creepin
Took her to the backroom about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch with a gun in her back
I said Lay down and unbutton your bra
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said Damn then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind was going up in her
The suspense was making me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick
I said Damn dropped the gat from my hand
What I thought was a bitch was nothing but a man 
Put the gat to his legs all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt so
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
I said get down I want you all facedown on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot 
Stacking up the money and theres more to collect
Cause I dont give a fuck I take travellers cheques
Yo Ren peep out the window and tell me what you see
Three motherfucking police staring at me what to do now
Hurry up and get armed
Alright tell me who hit the motherfucking alarm
Imma give ya a chance and count to three
Or else five of yall bitches are comin with me
Alright Alright come on out niggas or were coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in 
Fuck you we got hostages and plenty of loot
And dont give a damn and not afraid to shoot
Were sending out the hostages all except five
And if you dont meet our demands they wont stay alive
We want a copter so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
They shot a hostage they shot a hostage 
You stupid motherfucker trying to run
Now youre dead as fuck trying to race a gun
Alright this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast 
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up the shit was smokin
With screamin hostages running and chokin
Gettin away but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range by a motherfucking cop
And I hope they dont think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldnt fire the shit wouldnt work
So yall know what time it is
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Well Im giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or Im gonna shoot two of your guards 
Hehe they got me once but theyll never get me again

Kato 808 in my rhymes the Green Hornet
At times I lean on it yall just fiend on it
Im cold fronting throughout the metro
Piloting baby the globe is my area
Yeah the most feared villain in America
Toss the trigger I use to hit the sheriff up
Now Im convincing these dudes to get their lyrics up
Yall niggas bull too much yall niggas said enough
Sickin competitors heavily stressing this with ya
My medicine Yall finna go see the therapist
I gotta settle it black metal to metal
With these brothers on that bullshit pot calling the kettle crisp
What could be better bitch Im rocking the flag with the green black and red
And youre on the confederate boy you work for Merill Lynch
Yall aint fucking with a brother hell bent on success Im living evidence
See its really all about sensation and the fascination
We got to chase it dreams
Im trying to be the champ youre in to racing
Cause fuck wasting time on the consolation prize
Something undetectable to yall naked eyes
Still its probably more real than yall recognize
I specialize in raw carnivorous rhyming
Better silence it yall you couldnt size it
The fourth horseman give rise over the blade
Its going to cut you to a different size
In the days of guerrilla warfare
Making a change like carfare
I want these chumps taken off here
Sip my morning coffee kiss my baby girl
Tell my lady friend Im gone until I save the world
Jump in my hotrod wheel looking super thorough
Rocking an all black cape like the Duke of Earl
The essence of a movement on some smooth shit
Langston Hughes mixed in with some Stanley Kubrick
Sick still yet Im savvy penning a nasty masterpiece
That convey my sentiment exactly
Black Im that nice son from Michaelango or Michael Eric Dyson
Slicing like a viking dog Im white lightning
Im caught with a bone with a slight tick in my mind
Its tight frightening
The flow is part Mozart and part Malcom
Clearly you aint fearing you already know the outcome
Another victory were making history
Im stronger than the walls in the penitentiary

2622,"He said he came from Jamaica he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway I felt him helped him put him on lock seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium welcome
Bitches this pretty thats seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
Im Momma Dee in that order I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk but I like it when he be sober
Thats top of the toppa I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
Im in the zone
They holler at me but its you
You this aint high school
Me and my crew we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby its yours
Anywhere everywhere
Baby its your world aint it Alright 
Baby its your world aint it Uh 
She got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money she tell me Make me a wife
I tell her Bitch you crazy fuck wrong with you
And excuse my French but Im a long kisser
And then she try to tell me Im the only one thats hittin
And I say What about them niggas She say What about them niggas
You right what you doing tonight
Put on something tight dont judge me I get life
She love me like a brother but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet Ima need goggles
She tell me thats its mine I tell her stop lyin
Mine and who else She say worry bout yourself

Im from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And Im all about expandin my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle sellin blow in the park
Countin G stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie huntin
Trigger temper Im quick to body somethin
You lookin at me like Im probably frontin
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
Im older and smarter this is me at my best

Cause niggas like you be prayin on my downfall
Hopin I flop hopin I stop

Or be on the street corner with a pipe smokin the rock
I got more riches than you fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I havent got is more stitches than you
Fuckin punk you aint a leader what Nobody followed you
You was never shit your mother shouldve swallowed you

And if you think I cant fuck with whoever put your money up

Shirley was freaking like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard said her name was Laverne

And before you fuck with him you gotta fuck with his nine
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga
He could whoop his ass cause hes bigger

Hes a villain from the streets and hes supposed to rule
Not sayin hes in shit but hes down for mine
He was put on the streets to keep niggas in line
Never givin a fuck jealous of E

He cant help it hes in shit but he dont hold shit back

You can lock up yo shit hes still stealin
Gettin respect cause the boy kicks butt
But the real meaning is he dont give a fuck

I tell his money flow as he collects from his ho
All expenses paid for the rhymes that he made
Gold trophies in the house for the girls that he laid
Not a wimp hes a pimp now of course hes the boss
So keep your bitch out his face or else shes gonna get tossed
Too hard to be fucked with the boy got heart
Wanna fuck with him hell rip your head apart
Gangsta Gangsta thats what they yellin
But him with his gangsta stroll he keeps bailin
Wherever he goes theres no discussion but silence
They say that hes the one promotin gang violence
Thats a lie just a critic all that whack bullshit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin with
Cause Im a ruthless villain cold tearin shit up
Dont come on my face pumpin no kind of junk

RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im so high I cant feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I dont feel the love
RIP RIP
RIP RIP
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im in a brand new drop top Rari with 3 bitches
Tired being in the middle of trial with 3 snitches
And I hit up every club in your city
Where niggas at
I be in every club in the hood
Where niggas at
Pull up jump out stuntin like I was Baby
On my cocaine cowboy shit like in the 80s
Who the nigga think he is
Slick Rick or Dana Dane
Think he Rakim or something look at his chain
YSL from head to toe Im Doug E Fresh
Looking like I came to play Mitchell and Ness
Any nigga with a watch like that
He need attention
Your man dont ball out like that
You need to bench him
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im so high I cant feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I dont feel the love

Pockets on extra big theyre on Samoan
Got some bad bitches all in my section
Just let some more in
And every nigga came in with mell kick your door in
Roll up pass it around like we Jamaican
Whole pounds strapped up in this bitch like we some Haitians
She got good head good brains good education
Im drunker than a motherfucker heres the situation
145 am the knob broken
By the time a nigga get to the crib the mall open
Man the nerve of this highass bitch

She said she she want me to call her Ms Berry
She think she Halle

Got a pocket full of dead prez
Attached to your girl like a jpeg
Party scene turn to a murder scene
Keep shitting on niggas need potty train
Turn up collard green
Im on gasoline and

Life aint nothing but a G thing
Switch lanes get brain hand down her gstring

You fuck with me Ill put my foot in your ass

Style fresh like Im still a day old
And its been like that since the day 0
Im on time like a Roley or Seiko
Step on deck your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out get down or lay low
Let the sun shine 
Standin in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga I am Black Dante Let the sunshine in 
That nigga that dude
Black people lets move The suns shinin 
Shout out to my man Talib Kweli yes
We on topa topa shotta shotta

Slim nigga that cast a big shadow
Cherokee Red that shoot the long arrow
Got mo skill mo aim and mo ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like Hail Mary full of grace
Niggas come in and shoot up the place and make you pull up your face
The deck Ima pull out the ace
From the jungles of the Empire State where it aint no escape
247 718 and thats like every night every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the States Im collectin my pay
Blast off then Im back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Proball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised


Let the sun shine

You understandin me straight Let the sunshine in 
Yes yes no doubt Excellence
Its what it is its what it is and thats what it is you see
The suns shinin

Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God and involve with niggas
These elements help evolve my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn it dont matter if ya holler or whisper
You comin through clear cause Im right here witcha
Aint gotta edit your slang I got it I get ya
Yo brothers and sisters fathers and mothers
The lovers the leavers the doubters believers
The stayers the quitters the bitches the niggas
Rebel guerrillas to ghetto civilians
Yall gon feel it from the first to the millionth
Its extra ordinary and plain
I walked a thousand paces of life ahead of the game
By the time that you get where Im standin Ill be gone
Yall make moves but yall just move wrong
Let the sun shine 
I move in and yall must move on cause Im molto strong
And I know what my feet move for Let the sunshine in 
Make it go without a brand new car
I was fresh without a brand new song

1811,"I get on the mic for one reason that is to be heard
And when Im on the microphone I hope you dont miss a word
Im not saying do not enjoy yourself dont take a chance
To shake your head pat your feet clap your hands but dont dance
Cause if youre up and dancing then you wont really hear
The smoking rhyme that I design for you all to compare
With the other brother lovers of the hiphop culture
Beat is working rhymes are perking and its gotta be felt
But dont dancedont dance
They consider me epitome of rap and I know
Rappers wanna get rid of me cause at a live show
I got a voice like Luther Im bulletproofa
A rhyme that I design will always make you the
People take notice on how I always show this
Funky style forget the smile your facell say Yo this
Brothers not playing you know what Im sayin
MCs on your knees say Please start praying
Dont dancedont dance
Attention at ease emcees
You pay too much attention to the rhymes like these
One took part of my name others part of my fame
One took the rhythm now the people think that were on the same
Level of intelligence but thats irrelevant
If we ever battle head up you wont do well against me
Im the originator the only real creator
Called time bomb with the end of my detonator
Ready to blow up and totally show up
A rapper Ill slap and with a mean rhyme slow up
Huh you wanna go up against me then throw up
Your mic stand but make plans to get tore up
Cause Im gonna rip ya I would strip ya of the title
But I got it so get off my tip
Ya wannabe me MC ooh weeIm rocking me now
I know Im rocking you cause I could see your hand
Highfivin cause Im live and saying you heard the man
Dont dancedont dancedont dance
I said my rhyme loud proud now look at the crowd
Fellas ho ladies ow how
Could you take my style smile while stealing
You should bow down bend and be kneeling
Praying to me like a god go on
Just say my rhyme youre on mine subconsciously
You know that you cant live up
To my rap status drop your mic give up
Cause I am relentless thats why I spit this
Time to make a fresh rhyme and invent this
Style that youre hearing year out and year in
But suckers keep stealing it and then swearing to God
They didnt take it they know they didnt make it
But you cant lie to yourself give me a break it
Seemed to me that I was your favorite
Hiphop hero back in the days its
Undoubtedly obviously true
You wanted to be another Moe Dee when you
Started rhyming you see you had to be to some degree
An imitation variation of me
And now all of a sudden youre competition
So now you think you can change my position
Dont be dumb Im still number one
When you hear me come you better run and hide out
And enjoy yourself while you got the crowd fooled
Believing youre the best cause Ima take you to school
And if you really think youre better I want proof
Im calling you out this is the moment of truth
Dont dancedont dancedont dance

2765,"My mom is in the bedroom crying again
Sisters on the street corner lying again
Just heard about another one of my niggas dying again
Im trying again to make moves
Ill be damned if we go hungry
Ever since my pops passed the responsibilities belonged to me
This song you see is like an ode to God
That he blessed my last breath to be Allahu Akbar
And this city is hard tenement buildings are barred
Incarcerated and scarred no sentiment for when it becomes time for war
Im trying to score like Bernard King
My vocal box sling verbal cocaine like the government
I told you Id hurt the music
Travelling back busting shots at gunshots before Christ was persecuted
Mathematically we live at right angles
Fuck the Star Spangled the mayors the fallen angel
Dangling from moon crescents I persevere breathe the air
Inhale the effervescence of life
This street game is stifling Im trifling upholding a rifle
Peering from behind the eyes of God we at odds with ourselves
What is it worth when this barren metropolis prevail
Scale the walls of hell trail of a octopus
Ive seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet brainwash of the people
Niggasll never learn Shit we just concerned about
Whos fucking who when time is of significance
Ghost we disregard the most magnificent
Eat of the fruit that is poisonous and lethal
Stuck in the crux of the spell with the evil
Credits about to roll and hell is the sequel
Incarcerated Scarfaces in all places
Crack sales rise failed lives cops and robber car chases
Y2K fuck up youre left faceless
Hustlers bury money in Garcia Vega cigar cases
Give the drummer some pianos guitar basses
Trumpet in tune Pharoahe and Prince legitimate reasons for why they thumping
Hi Im the most endangered species
By all means survival is what I teach seeds
First time offenders catching seven to fifteen
Now my vision of life is hell and heaven on split screen
Bust your shit like Mitch Greene Snitch I switch scenes
Bring drama to that ass thats how we on it in Queens What 
Stray bullets continue shattering dreams battering spleens
Im gathering schemes had only cream just as bad as a fiend
Take food from a table and get drunk to your death
Now feel it in your heart from the love in my breath
Ive seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet brainwash of the people
Niggasll never learn Shit we just concerned about
Whos fucking who when time is of significance
Ghost we disregard the most magnificent
Eat of the fruit that is poisonous and lethal

1717,"Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
New York New York the city that never sleeps
Bodies covered in white sheets are layin in the streets
Shit gets deep as we creep up the block by the kids slangin rocks
And holdin Glocks stolen from the cops to get props
You gotta split a top on the regular
Or get plugged in your mug from a slug by your competitor
Gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder no wonder
Another brother six feet under
You know it aint no jokin when the streetlights are broken
So keep your eyes open or get ready for a smokin loc
Step out of line I hope you got your nine gun son
The Smith and Wess you better press 911 word up 
Or make a run for it theres too many to tackle
The Big Applell put your ass on ice like a Snapple
So even though I rap I gots to stay strapped
Niggas act up I back up PIYAH 
I bust a cap inside your fuckin hat
Dont even pose with them hoes the swinger that you chose
Just might be down with the foes only the shadow knows
And aint no lollipop lollipop over here only the shottie pops
BOOM Now just sit back and watch the bodies drop
The younger gunmen got the bigger niggas runnin
The shorties what the shorties what the shorties are comin
To push a nigga wig back and leave his ass flat on his back
The motherfuckin ghetto knows and its like that
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
Todays headlines another nigga dead
Six to the body and fo to the head
Followed the red bitch in the bed full of lead
A drugrelated case and now the place is filled with Feds
Ramshacked the shack disclouse bout two kilos of dope
Two ounces of cokes caught in the pocket of his coat
So another brother caught the ultimate surprise
With blown out brains to drop stains on his eyes
Dazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news
Watchin his family goin through all the boohoos
You lose like an Ill Street the Blues are gettin deeper
Nothin left in the room except for him the Grim Reaper
Police will take a few snapshots scoop up some blooddrops
Pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots
The cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street
So they just pull out the white sheets to cover up the dead meat
Seal off the area with yellow tape draw the white
Chalk around the body now the party has to motivate
One more outlaw was murdered on the scene for the green
Died at the age of seventeen
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
Strollin the concrete packin my heat walkin the backstreets
I seen niggas pull up peepin me out the side a black Jeep
Six feet deep thats where Im goin if Im slippin
Steady cockin my shit cause I already got the clip in
Now whos the first nigga to run up here they come up
The block hardrocks with Glocks rollin holdin they guns up
I buck I buck and then I struck one in the chest
Nigga shoulda wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest
But now I got three mo niggas pullin triggers
Strays are ricochetin off the bricks zigga zigga
But who got the biggest strap Whos bustin bigger caps
My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS
No haps G Rap aint goin out like a sucker
I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker
Quick I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin at me
Cause I wont be too happy with a slug inside my nappy
Two more niggas left they scared to death but Im leary
Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me
I went between two cars lettin off the quarter pound
I see another body fallin down to the ground
Quick I run up on him cause I dont think that hes dead
Standin over his ass I put two more inside his head
Thats three niggas down only got one nigga to go
I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so
I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up
Nearly shot my whole clip up I got one more slug to rip up
Look over by the GS see his ass stickin his head out
Boom let the lead out blew a piece of his brain dead out
The back of his head now hes dead because he fell face down
Right on the motherfuckin streets that he dwelled
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows

This is The Course of the Inevitable
Yo the audacityâitâtakes to rankâme with the style I invented
Wearâmy credentials like its jewelry they gave my flowers cemented
To hell with honorable mentions artists are comical temptin
Horrible albums new ventin three pounds of vomit who sent em
Stereo blood or laughing they heliumd up your last king
Cant muzzle me up with no coffin wont hit me with no vaccine
Goons in the black Beem turn your crew to a track team
Highly viewed on the rap scene sly maneuvers and cash streams
Flee from the copper sound racist coppers they chop us down
Ounces of 14K you RIP boxes with rocks around
None of yall profit bound crypt the equipment out the sockers now
Get with the art or drown rubber bands stackin up dollar pounds
Revenge is on its job karmall sneak a gun in softly
Been callin up to God startin to think He hung up on me
Number orgy figured you need some incentive to come support me
One or two flips Im out of here hit the work with a somersault we on

Live all your days like its your last cause in a blink you could be gone
You rather love or will respect Showin that lovell get you harmed
Wont be no empathy cause you going through it gotta be strong Yeah 
Its always easier for you to do wrong Big Rabbit Gang yeah 
Went on a yacht got seasick cant fuck on the boat no more

Get rich and charge it all to a bitch thats how this shit posed to go
My geekers wanna damn near OD they want that got em dead
Kitchen full of powder I turn my bitch to a powderhead
Niggas takin deals thats the only way you get out the feds
Castrated dick in his fuckin mouth when they found him dead Yo slow down Fred

Studios Ive been torturing Ima dedicate this to all the less fortunate
Theres a lack of real niggas fucked up the war percent
Victory is a gorgeous sin bought the Benz so you all can vent
More content with a fortune spent no disrespect from talks exempt
Mackin gave me a freezin chest always thirty degrees or less
Destined for me to be the best out of QU two Es NS
Vegetable state for being fake EMS to a vegan death
Poverty leaves you breathin stressed legal mess on the freedom steps
Celebrity never made me my sentiments made me crazy
187s the consequence 718s the AC
Troubled to say the least pray the heavenly gates embrace thee
Theres finally notoriety thats gon come with a late fee
Performance style is a 40 cal back out movin the army now
Far away from the corny crowd dying you call me out now
I can still hear the money calling I done been out the way too long
Nothing out here is more important put in the spot where I belong
Gotta know how to take a loss give me that curse when I was born
The last nigga that go to sleep will be the first to be put on
Live all your days like its your last cause in a blink you could be gone
You rather love or will respect Showin that lovell get you harmed
Wont be no empathy cause you going through it gotta be strong
Its always easier for you to do wrong

And we came to rock the spot like Ironman Starks
They be the illest emcees in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the RZA
So listen to them clear and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with WuTang Killer Beez
From where we at to my mans cell
From where we at
Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists light up the mic Godacknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points Corolla Motorola holder
Play it god Epack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks player like Yanks check the franchise
Front on my guys my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him manhandle him if you wanna
Run in his cribo get ditto skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Dre
Thugs they be booing and screwing we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doingfuck the union
Its the same style RZAs train aboard jump the turnstile
On the island he tried to challenge God for the new Bals
Especially that aluminum bat in the Ac
Relax lay back sell a grenade a dait pays black
The Mac10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands revive lands
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing em jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing em rocking his jewels like we using em
Lowpro star seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods build with the Sun Moon and Star

But if your skills are weak you better step behind us
Ghost Face Ghosface Killah
Mercury raps is roughed then god just shown like taps
Red and white Wallys that match bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper Radio Barber
Murder sleepaway camp the fly lady champ
The arsonist who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines pick herbal beans bubbling strings
Biochemical cream we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape wicked like Nixon
Blonde heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binocularsthe rap blacksmith
Moneys Rolex was rockless Chef ragtop is spotless
Im Iron Man no diecast metal Im steelalloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deliing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

2773,"A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I see through walls thats hard to climb
Im losing my mind
No medicaid no medication
Thinking youre better off dead
Instead should have been dedicated to education
I spin the cylinder on my revolver
I spin the cylinder
Would someone explain whod leave a dick in charge of a bush
Of a colon Im screwed saw more war than Warsaw Poland viewed
An infants insides outside of his body
Inside of a place of worship ungodly
Out cries tears Dear God where are we
Thats what I scream towards the skyline but probably
No one can hear a word of what I was saying
Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying
Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by
Lights flash if i could only put the past on a flashdrive Id
For peace of mind install an external drive
So Id be more driven internally to survive

My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health
It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth
Void I defected employed self annoyed
Went independent enjoyed stealth
Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac
The rents cheaper in the ghetto but you cant go back
So I spin the cylinder on my revolver
Then maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra
And dissolve into the abyss without evolving
Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver
Research like George Washington Carver
But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then
Part instead of being incredibly defiant
Peddle through revenue issues Ill do it for medical science
Its better to be levelheaded than to regret it and pious
Settling for life without sunshine never vibrant Im

3151,"Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry and gets by while others choose to wonder why
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit but he didnt wanna
As he got older he got even worse
Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldnt survive but hey
I aint the one to speak up on anothers
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and thats the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldnt raise
And she will never see her father again cause hes in a grave
Hey yo lets think about it nilla
My daddy was a dopeman so Ima be a dope dealer
How will the family explain it
My daughter had a baby for a caine head
He aint around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid now shes realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealers all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situations got me guessin
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray and a second to die
It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead he didnt stand a chance
You shoulda seen him he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest and one to his head
He just laid there in silence
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up
Followed by a lawman and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher
But if he survives Im willin to betcha
Hell be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit its a hit were gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK47 M11 and a pump
Rolled by Worthing on Scott Street
School was lettin out
Yo you aint gonna shoot yet WATCH ME
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun
He shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
JD rolled by and smoked Blacks brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a port
Full speed down Reed shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullen
His brother was just dazed in a shock Why you do it
Why you shoot his moms Jay Shit
Hehehehehe hah man fuck that bitch
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack Aiyyo JD homie
Hung it up and rolled down Dacca
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didnt fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull hes expired
A whole army came out
Twentyseven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the Acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to die
",rounds And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground A woman yelled get an ambulance But I knew he was dead he didnt stand a chance You shoulda seen him he was scared A bullet goes to his chest and one to his head He just laid there in silence And all I heard was the sirens Paramedics pulled up Followed by a lawman and then came a firetruck Put his ass on the stretcher But if he survives Im willin to betcha Hell be out for revenge They patched him up within a week he was back at it again Went to his brother on the Northside Grab your shit its a hit were gonna take a long ride Packed it up in the trunk AK47 M11 and a pump Rolled by Worthing on Scott Street School was lettin out Yo you aint gonna shoot yet WATCH ME Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun He shot him Put his tooly on the front seat Continued his mission as he headed down the street The kids was just starin at each other JD rolled by and smoked Blacks brother Reached in his coat and grabbed a port Full speed down Reed shot his mom on the porch On his way down Cullen His brother was just dazed in a shock Why you do it Why you shoot his moms Jay Shit Hehehehehe hah man fuck that bitch Went to the store to use the payphone Called up Mack Aiyyo JD homie Hung it up and rolled down Dacca Headin for the nigga he was after By the time he arrived at the scene Malcolm was ready for anything He tried to sneak around the back way Never thought of bein taken out on that day Black boy black coat Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat He didnt fall so he fired One to the middle of his skull hes expired A whole army came out Twentyseven niggas all strapped out of one house That how it happens in the Acre One nigga died in the park in the paper Shit gets deeper but why I guess you only get a minute to pray And a second to die,Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die But some cry and gets by while others choose to wonder why His life was took at such an early age A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge He used to hustle on the street corners His mom would always beg him to quit but he didnt wanna As he got older he got even worse Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse A cold night in his hood he had a tangle The brother he was squabblin with had broke his ankle Laid him out in the driveway Some people knew he wouldnt survive but hey I aint the one to speak up on anothers All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother He chose the wrong way and thats the route he took Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook He had a baby that he couldnt raise And she will never see her father again cause hes in a grave Hey yo lets think about it nilla My daddy was a dopeman so Ima be a dope dealer How will the family explain it My daughter had a baby for a caine head He aint around to see her walk Dry her eyes when she cries pick her up when she falls Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child It gets deeper he used to punch her and beat her She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card Had a kid now shes realizin life is hard A big time dope dealers all she wanted Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it The situations got me guessin But the answer remains to be a question He lived his life in a lie I guess you only get a minute to pray and a second to die It was crazy how it happened Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin All I could see was a pistol spittin
1513,"Ill tell you this much hiphop is not dead
Change gone come just like Barack said
Money power respect like The Lox said
Youll be the man of the house my pops said
Now can you picture me rolling like Pac said
Do it for the inmates and all of the hotheads
Heat the streets up right quick its all timing
Gucci everything Sierra Leone diamonds
Tell you this much 
This aint even a rap its a controlled substance
Yeah hold on 
You can curse You can curse 
Oh I can curse 
Headonhead collision Im a problem
And nobody can solve em Im long division
On the road of success but its more of a mission
They said I would be dead or I was goin to prison
Know one of them is certain but the other one isnt
I made rare decisions rock diamonds that impared your vision
Even supplied yall for years with listen
Like Im just starting but I got years of wisdom
Stripes I got nigga it took years to get em
Whenever you see him notice his same peers is with him
He destroys tracks the minute he hears the rhythm
Not only a hell of a flow but his ears forbidden
And if you think this is a ring tone yea you kiddin
Fifty thousand records sold right yea you kiddin
It was his time to go he aint care who did em
Didnt appreciate life and got aired for living
PCP by the liter good cheeba
Sergios tech sweat suits good Adidas
The jewels is invincible that we was suppose to get from them
Use to send them to the store now we blowin piff with them
Nowa days its different I was fortunate
Cause I did alot of listening the new era is missin it
Everybody three fifty seven and four fifn it
Drug program two to four three to sixn it
Feds send niggas way out by lake Michigan
Put the coke in the tires only if they Michelin
Never talk on the fone only deal with official men
You dont even know homie that put you in the shit you in
Gotta busy schedule and I dont think I can fit you in
Whats good for me aint good for them
No matter what set you claim or what hood you in
I hit you and I find you a wood box for them to put you in
Yeah and you dont stop and you cant stop 
Yo a lot of niggas lost their pops to the drug game
Other niggas lost their blocks when the thugs came
They knew how to box aint know bout the slug game
As soon the money get right thats when the love change
Niggas know who to call when they want raw
Kiss is the cornerstone of the corner store
DBlock general he stay shining
In the back of the van 2K9ing
My dope so strong its giving fiends the hiccups
Coke so high it got niggas doing stickups
Found out another nigga dead light the piff up
Make sure one is in the head load the fifth up
Play my hand right baby I held aces
Nothing on the scene but blood and shellcases
Nike gloves on the team they cant trace us
Snitches in the witness protection getting facelifts
These niggas will never be able to fuck with me
Say my grace before I give em a buck fifty
The whole hood with me they hating we all spiffy
Everythings a short shot nothing iffy
Yeah Arpil 7th baby The Last Kiss you know what it is baby

1246,"x2 
Its a struggle its got a hold on me
The universal struggle its got a hold
From Sofia Bulgaria to the New York interior
You see poverty and crime throughout these areas
And people with tattered clothes babies from battered homes
Pure hard times just theyre dying from that alone
From US shores to countries overseas
This universal struggles got a hold on me
Every citys got a ghetto the prisons are filled
The police and the military in position to kill
And I just wanna live my life with less pain
Seems like only a few moves left in this chess game
I guess change has gotta come soon
I cant live my life in fear waiting for doom
And actions of course speak louder than words
Its much harder when you standing in a crowd to be heard
So I walk alone and look forward to better days
Im not the same anymore I endured with better ways
x2 
Its a struggle its got a hold on me
The universal struggle its got a hold
From the hoods of Los Angeles to Toronto Canada
You can picture the struggle without no camera
The wealthy get wealthier cause thats the aim
The less fortunate get desperate and thats a shame
Whos to blame we complain nobody responds
So our only alternative is to try to move on
And show resilience in the face of danger
Determination and strength to replace the anger
Great people of the world rise up from despair
Historically our kind has always been here
To lead effectively when we need the recipe
For peace so we educate the seed respectfully
And this is how we beat the struggle
Staying tuned and keep out the reach of trouble
The bloodshed the oppression the violence the famine
We can trace it through various events we examine

If you do it my way my way my way 
Hush baby

Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood
Mildmannered or up to nogood
It really doesnt matter either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop Spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But theres faith in our mind
Were spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast the whole worlds in a rush
Everybody just hush

If you do it my way my way my way 
Gotta do it my way 
Hush baby 
Its all a test the pain the drama
The villa in the Bahamas
The highs the lows
The Hooptie the Rolls
The money flowin
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortons or Sizzler steak
But everything will be okay
If we do it my way my way my way
Cuz I believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl Ill swim to France
Cuz ya beautys unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love forever we are attached
Deal with the drama we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach
Hush baby
Hush baby wanna let ya know

If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby dont talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok

Like we Siamese twins connected by our brains
Walkin thru the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothings gonna change
God willin we still be doin our thang
When my sixpacks faded
And raps outdated
But thats many years from now so dont rush
Little mama just hush

3120,"Look at you no pleasure in creative thinking because you dont think creatively anymore
The real joy of being a human being is to be able to use your mind in the manner that the Almighty God has designed the human mind to do
Tug of war and my minds like a clash of the titans
Thoughts contrast so its layers to my writin
God fearin but Im Guy Fisher
Yeah God hearin but Im gone fishin
Im an artist drug dealer foreign car keys
Drop jewels so these falcons like the Maltese
Birds in the trunk so these keys now they homin
Letters and numbers on the Coupe like its Roman
Woo all black like the omen
Kim said it yup BIG wrote it
So Im feeling like a Greek god when I quote it
Lightyears ahead but I was caught up in the moment
Moment of clarity moment of silence
Burner on my waist yet Im saying stop the violence
Sitting on that white horse look at prince valiant
Dad shakes his head cause the worst waste his talents
I philosophize for them Pitchfork scholars
Devil on my shoulder and the pitchfork follows
Poking at my problems I know how to solve em
With a ski mask automatic or revolver
A slave is one whose power and authority is ruled over by another and whose sphere of freedom is limited according to the wishes of a master Your power and authority is ruled over by another and your sphere of freedom of activity is governed by the wishes of somebody else
Them niggas wanna see me runnin they know I wont
They say misery loves company no I dont
Aint got no time for you to try on no Manolo Blahniks
All I got time to do is go back in time and pose with the Unabomber
Just so I can go back in time a second time to photobomb it
I live by a code of demonic Illuminati Obama Hovanomics
Hold up hurdles in life I hop in a Turbo and roll around em
Im Doug E Fresh in the flesh I beat box
I booboodudu between the sheets to seek the GSpot
Im in bed with three naked ladies holding hands
Im in bed with three major labels
And I aint talkin bout wearing clothing brands
Underground locomotive man
Putting on a global show that no promoter can
I philosophize with wise words from learned lessons
In my world mistakes turns to blessings
The hate turned to destiny
Im saying Lord Jesus while the Lords most gorgeous creatures take turns blessing me
I got your baby momma down on all fours
When drama comin Im all for it
If it aint about the money please let this be your last question
You players can jump if you want but you halfstepping like Paul George
I make the yay invisible in like a day or two
Thats how the players do my nigga theres layers to it


First in science first in technology wealthiest country on Earth most powerful country on Earth is twenty sixth in education So you have all been taken and you dont even realize that you have been dumbed to the point where you are like sheep
Paranoid of poverty hustle was the philosophy
I seen a kilo I swear it became a part of me
Lie cheat and steal I had it mastered by my teens
Started hands on a nigga still pulling strings
Hotel suites straight selling niggas dreams
Motel 6 as I let the beeper ring
Was a water boy but balling always in my genes
Season ticket holder nigga sitting with the team
Feds on the roof of the spreads in the juice
So suspicious of the cars tuitions for the schools
Labeled a mastermind I positioned every move
Shots fired now the deposition from the crew
Smooth operation but the money came in knots
Forty million there I dare you tell me what Im not
I own fifty homes and wanna get fifty more
Counting this fast money and fucking my bitches slow

Tell them mothafuckas Im forever paid
California king wrestle gators in that Everglade
Drive up out that mothafuckin swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin rsum
Started off on Ground Zero then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole I never hesitate
Dre Beats on smokin that chronic just to meditate
Ima give em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight Im Aftermaths heavyweight
Now Dres weapon of mass destruction is bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me shit I was sellin weight
Now a niggas sellin millions now its time to celebrate
Performin in front of millions nigga every race
64 in the 64 now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album no five mics Then let em hate
But Im not stoppin till Im the fuckin king in every state
Recognize my life ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record Ima wreck it even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart nigga fuck your feelings this is me
Im sick of mothafuckas talkin about the West died
Cant you hear my heart beatin Thats the motherfuckin Westside
You test me you test God Im His son
It say in Psalms you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You wont have no time to run
Im from the Compton slums and thats how the West ride
Im from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of em spit like Im the ghost of em
Damn I said I spit like Im the ghost of em
Name your top 10 Im harder than the most of em
Matter of fact shorten your list nigga top 5
Game Biggie Hov probably Pac Nas
No particular order bet a mill that I slaughter
And serve niggas give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When Im the nigga sold 5 mill out the gate and numbers do not lie
Recognize my life ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record Ima wreck it even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart nigga fuck your feelings this is me
I gave you The Documentary shit was a classic
Gave you Doctors Advocate you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out torn between Aftermath and
Geffen Interscope now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper its like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin for
Im the lost angel knockin on Satans door
What the fuck yall take me for
I love you cause you hate me more
Im Kobe on the Lakers floor except I give you 84
Shake you like Haitis floor
Walk up on you like Whats goin on baby boy
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either Im crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen no disrespect to Calvin
Recognize my life ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright cause I want that shot
Im a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record Ima wreck it even if my record dont pop
Ima tie a knot on a downtown buildin
Let it tow behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart nigga fuck your feelings this is me
Kendrick and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down knowin damn well
We dont wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime Thug Life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin when the LA Raiders
Was in my home snapback fitted on my uncles dome
And I dont condone dickridin
Im addicted to Westsidin
Livin in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly but it turned me to a lion
Tryin and I mean that shit
Game came through put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadnt seen that shit
Compton a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial never TVscreened that shit
Cant block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit

1328,"You gotta make the money first
Then when you get the money you get the power
Then when you get the power Then you get the woman
The problem is you broke You aint got no car or job
You slow with your hustle You dress like a slob
Ladies aint looking for no brothers like this
They want the dubtwisting ballers with the ice on their wrist
You gotta get your cash right to get in the game
Might have to pull a pistol Flip some caine
Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain
Take your come up and reinvest to the game
You gotta make the money first
You need a lot to go far
What you think is rich I just spent on a car
What you think is paid I just blew on a watch
What you think is wealthy I just dropped on a yacht
Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks
Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops
But it really aint that easy Or we all would be rich
One mistake Youre broke The come ups a bitch
Make the right moves and forget about sleep
Concentrate on the paper chase Join the elite
Few dun got mad cash and money to spend
Money to straight blow and money to lend
And only then You made it past stage one My friend
Now you got the money and the cash flow thick
But you really aint nothing but a richer trick
Just because youre paid you can still get thick
By your low life homies or skanless bitch
You gotta move it around put it in the right hands
Maybe a judge Make a PA your friend
Understand what really moves the world
Recognize what really moves these girls
Juice is more important than cash for real
Money you spend But true power you feel
It aint that easy to reach
Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get
Make your moves correct Watch your crew
Watch your back They watching you
Anybody round you has gotta be true
Or you never make it past stage two
Listen when you get the real true power You know
People will feel you Wherever you go
And when you really max this game
Youll never have to say your name
Now you got the power Its on My friend
Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men
The one thing women hate are brothers that bend
They act like they like em But they only pretend
They wanna be with that man in the VI
They dont wanna stand in line
You outta your mind
That other players got cash But no juice
Cuz the powerful men get to choose
From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews
Willing to do much more than before
Give you quick brains Its insane
Just what the womanll do just for you
Cuz if you got the power Then they gets it too
If you rollin benz Then they rollin too
If you livin phat Then they ballin too
That sounds stupid to you Not to me
They winning one move when it takes us three
Cars Big houses And shopping sprees
While most of us see the penitentiary
",it around put it in the right hands Maybe a judge Make a PA your friend Understand what really moves the world Recognize what really moves these girls Juice is more important than cash for real Money you spend But true power you feel It aint that easy to reach Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get Make your moves correct Watch your crew Watch your back They watching you Anybody round you has gotta be true Or you never make it past stage two Listen when you get the real true power You know People will feel you Wherever you go And when you really max this game Youll never have to say your name Now you got the power Its on My friend Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men The one thing women hate are brothers that bend They act like they like em But they only pretend They wanna be with that man in the VI They dont wanna stand in line You outta your mind That other players got cash But no juice Cuz the powerful men get to choose From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews Willing to do much more than before Give you quick brains Its insane Just what the womanll do just for you Cuz if you got the power Then they gets it too If you rollin benz Then they rollin too If you livin phat Then they ballin too That sounds stupid to you Not to me They winning one move when it takes us three Cars Big houses And shopping sprees While most of us see the penitentiary,You gotta make the money first Then when you get the money you get the power Then when you get the power Then you get the woman The problem is you broke You aint got no car or job You slow with your hustle You dress like a slob Ladies aint looking for no brothers like this They want the dubtwisting ballers with the ice on their wrist You gotta get your cash right to get in the game Might have to pull a pistol Flip some caine Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain Take your come up and reinvest to the game You gotta make the money first You need a lot to go far What you think is rich I just spent on a car What you think is paid I just blew on a watch What you think is wealthy I just dropped on a yacht Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops But it really aint that easy Or we all would be rich One mistake Youre broke The come ups a bitch Make the right moves and forget about sleep Concentrate on the paper chase Join the elite Few dun got mad cash and money to spend Money to straight blow and money to lend And only then You made it past stage one My friend Now you got the money and the cash flow thick But you really aint nothing but a richer trick Just because youre paid you can still get thick By your low life homies or skanless bitch You gotta move
1654,"I gotta get out of here this citys gonna kill me
Could be anywhere
Anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman movin through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move
Through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as Im passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him Queens 
Forty one times he committed no crime
But I guess life aint Times Square
But in the city thats gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayors a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it and Brooklyn keep on taking it
Cause life just aint that fair
For the kids in the park watching out for the Narcs
Blowing Sour Diesel in the air
Tryin to flip them a pack stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here New York 
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me Out to me out to me 
I can hear them calling out
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me Out to me out to me 
I can hear them calling out
Let the city peel away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me out to me
I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though its black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward these young black boys
Seem to selfsabotage theyselves
Or maybe theyre just smart and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston well it kills itself Atlanta 
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me Out to me out to me 
I can hear them calling out I can hear them calling out 
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me Out to me out to me

Yo
The way I feel sometimes its too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill mellow down blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the street the people breathe without hope
They goin through the motion they dimmin down the focus
The focus get cleared then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes yall dont hear me
I push it past the bass know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones black
Im so wide awake that Im hardly ever sleep
My flow forever deep
And its volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
Im everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well
Quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force high low or right across
Soul is the lions roar voice is the siren
I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous theres no need for fightin
Suckers tryin to hide like the struggle wont find em
Then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind em
Its everywhere Penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well

You think all the girls around here are trickin
Up there lookin like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window
But I aint got shit but the pad and pencil
I cant wait till I hear you say
Im going down mayday mayday Im gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Yall rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force but we dont want ya
Standin on my roof with the rocket launcher
So fly like an eagle
But dont follow us wherever we go
The shit that Im saying make sure its heard
Motherfuck you and your punkass ghetto bird
Run run run from the ghetto bird
Run run run from the ghetto bird
Now my homeys here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the fo next
Now the fo I was driving was hotter than july
Looked up and didnt see a ribbon in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
Calling all cars I think weve got em
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood
South Central Compton and Watts
Long Beach bust a U here come the cops
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on Ds I look suspicious
You know that Im running
Shit I hear it humming
Fuck I see it coming
Is it a bird Yup
Is it a plane No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla had to ditch the Impala
Lets see if they would folla
Me hit a fence hit a fence and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my kinfolk
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
Cause Im getting chased by the ghetto bird
Just put his hat ehrrr he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On Errr hes acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit going 115
Miles an hour with the police chasing him Ehm theyre not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him no matter what the eh
Ehrr they hate they hate a bigmouth even worse
Officer Birds on his way and I dont wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the BM
See I didnt want to gank you
But dont make me bank you thank you
Tried to get to the hood and you might guess
That a fool like me done shot Cyrus
Incognito Ghetto Eagle
Saying Fuck where did he go
I bust me a left on Ruthelen Park
The 735 and Im bailin
Went to my homegirls house and got a hug man
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the fo on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I closed the blinds cause I didnt wanna catch a case
All that night I heard the bird circle
While I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch
By two AM I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird
Which way is he going now
Ok nownow heshes actually southboundon a service street
And uhGee whiz uh Im gonna get my maps out here and figure

3451,"My mom took me to Sam Goody
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
I fuck with Game
I like 50 Cent
He reminds me SpongeBob
And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
Theyre my friends
Psyche
I went down one of them bodega shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home put it in my boombox
Thought I was bout to be on some Radio Raheem shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams in 88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wall Street for life now
GGGUnot
300 Bars and Runnin
Just loan me your ears for fifteen minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown
Pass the doja 45 in the holster
Hollow tipsll fold em them niggas they toy soldiers
Oh that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like Im the president but this aint the Takeover
Now theres the speaker bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that When Im just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard yeah standing his ground
Im saying if you gon retire then hand me the crown
Nah let Bleek do it then throw him a concert in Madison Square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar Ill let the lines speak to em
What they say Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing Ima smack em silly
What you thought Them was the only niggas rapped in Philly
See them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
Cosmic Kev called said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a Uturn I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheesesteak thats what I told the cops
So they wouldnt get the dogs start searching for the Glock
And I cant forget BIG got murdered by the cops
Even I was ready to die when I heard that he was shot
Whats beef Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing anything still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block so I dont feel threatened
When Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot
Ask 50 it get lonely on top you can hate me
Or love me but now the cops the only homies he got
When its beef we eat when we hear bologna we pop
You sell records but a GGGUnot
Acting big on the radio to me you not
You can ask Mister Cee who hot
Tony Yayo I bet 10 Gs you flop
Run up on that new 300C you got
Stop hoping I fall hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you blackout before you see the cops
I aint High Top from Colors Im from Cedar Block
But what I got in my high topsll make your breathing stop
Im a gangsta slash rapper check your CD shop
Im like Elvis in there they cant believe he dropped
Now Im moving on up to George and Weezys spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it then loosened the straps
It get hot in here let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets put the dueceduece to your hat
Then call the pigs tell them the rooster is back
Call Jadakiss tell him that duke is back
Im still by your side no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks it aint about who could rap
Its about when the Ruger clap is rufus back
I see what you thinkin you want me to die is that so
Now you left leaning back thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven you ready Lets go
Drop them off then pop Cristal with Esco
Ima say he hit me first if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a braveheart
Now thats the eulogy beefing is kinda foolish
See niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars Im still gon shine
Im ten years younger than Yayo I get out Im fine
Then I go right back nigga I pop minds
How you gon drop Olivia You only drop dimes
I knew you changed when you started sleeping in that vest dawg
I dont need 50 Cent my niggas make collect calls
1800split a faggot nigga wig
He got GUnit wings throw em off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is overcareer is over
We in QB banging CNN in the Rover
TONY thats Capone n NORE
You aint the talk of New York your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off nigga go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent to send you a copy of Beef 3
Im airing their ass out on DVD
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me
Im a GUnit toy soldier on Sesame Street
Doing voice overs bitch ass nigga
Need a rhyme dictionary to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio when I first got signed
He got stuck he called 50 tried to borrow some lines
Thats the wrong nigga when you need help with your rhyme
All he gon tell you is say GUnit one more time
Got mad cause I aint wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja why you aint go at Shyne
He freestyled from the pen thats just the fact
Said hed put you with your mom and you aint fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops he never bust no cap
Like father like son go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning not to trust those cats
Id kill em all if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine I treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
And Im far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it put it in the store the shit moving
Gave em a hundred bars they aint think I could do it
Came with two hundred nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it that boy hot like summer
Both feet in the dirt 300 Bars and Runnin
I beef with any nigga say my name motherfucka Im gunnin
You can put it on Skee if you want it
Ill air you out on Drama King Mike or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordan shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Dont hit me on the Sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50s police to use his
Cause Bloods gonna get ya
BloodBloodBloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains when I pop shots
Outside NY in front of hiphop cops
Or broad day in LA Ima tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music aint nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs then put it on his tapes
So Ima take him out his house put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad let him scream for the jakes
Cause when you fucking with Jayceon you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggas on them CDs and tapes
Ask him to scratch a record you will see that he is fake
If 50 was Puffy youd run and go get him a cheesecake
Take the DJ off your name Mr Instant Replay
Now the instant replay I mean the machine
That GUnit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only feel your shit just a lil bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil bit
On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit
Only on two songs now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest I see to your death yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebok to make him some boots get him a head band
To cover the holes in his head he a dead man
For thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam
Without a METHOD Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice never wear Air Max to the bing
Unless you one of the Bloods or a Latin King
Cause if you left with the Aryans your assll sting
And your cellmate is a 25 to lifer
Theyll stab you in Folsom then fuck you on Rikers
And life goes on
Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits you shouldve kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move Im blasting add those to the last ones
Ten shots from the MAC empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling thats enough let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking Fase think Im locin backing up
Reverse the 05 hearse on 41st and traffic what
Hiphop cops on my left but I pass em up
The Dodge got a Hemi in it Game got Remy in em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I miss the old king that New York had
Whos this fake nigga on pictures with the Jake nigga
Got his crew starving cause he ate the whole cake nigga
He aint Nas aint BIG aint Jigga
If he aint Cube or Pac then who you got
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
Ill use another six bars to tell you who you not
You aint 50 Cent he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica three months after Wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
Cmon man what happened to the thug
Now you could find in the club him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now Im into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family Game had to go
Nigga Ill smack that hoe like Im JackiO
Cause I dont wanna be cool I dont wanna be you
I dont wanna shake hands or wear your GUnit shoes
Dont want you on my hooks dont wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait for the summer 
To be gone so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted
Pull the brim low if they dont get it
Bentley Coup on gold Daytons I was the first one with it
Four times platinum I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord giveth Lord taketh away
So I build a house on top of HipHop Ill wait for the day
Niggas hating on me they dont want Jayceon to play
And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the squad car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimal pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock nah this aint no subliminal Jay
The summer too hot and I just want the winter to stay
Cause Im a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand em off to Dre he turned them into grenades
And Just Blaze cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever then Im Kanye West
Take a look at my chest a hundred thou wet Jacob
Whole crew got chains a hundred thou cant break em
And the flow is hot like thou with Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get the more willing to snake em
So soon as the beat drop watch where I take em
Compton swap meet to get me some AllStars
When Game in the house they callin all cars
Cause they heard about what went on in DC
Heard about Hot 97 my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience
I think not cause if he did I wouldnt be involved in his nonsense
Wouldnt be in Harlem wouldnt be at this conference
Id rather be pushing rock like Samantha Ronson
50 whispered in my ear like we still bonding
We aint friends Im just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air one hand on my Johnson
HipHop police on me like Im the convict
What happened to the old school I thought it was rhyming
Doug E Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common
Now that aint common its more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds they kicked me out of
GUnit and I rebounded like Rodman
Its still Aftermath two feet in the paint
Should I be mad I aint
Im supposed to stop I cant
Because Im in the hood politicking Impala liftin
And I keep a black fourfive on the side of my Prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like Im fresh outta prison
Dollar vision blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then reup like Kim before the dcup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you aint gon do that so motherfucker move back
While I do BIG and Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead everybody remove hats
We miss yall can I get a hand clap
Now back to rap and why I gotta stay strapped
On that murder TIP kill you ASAP
They dont know which hole to patch up when the K clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck now its time for payback
It go how you from Cashville but you aint got no cash nigga
Said my name now thats your fucking ass nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck buck buck from my AK47
This nigga playing with his life I might have to put him in Heaven
Tryna play the game talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burials when Im reincarnating HarryO
And you dont want that David cause you love your life
Get my Vibe When its war he pull out butter knifes
Motherfucker Ima show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc now who the wanksta
When Suge had you you were stranded on the row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch and thats hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning GUnit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands and you aint had the ten stacks
Picture that I thought we was GUnit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did the shit
Ask CMurder the boy aint hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him the boy is mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you 50 Banks Yayo and the cops
And Olivia I mean for a man she hot
Now Im running out of breath like I just beatboxed
Got twenty bars to go lay it down like sheet rock
Dont worry about the flow the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November nigga fuck Reeboks
Im fly like a hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov the new BIG the new Pac I need three spots
280 in aint no getting me back
Im yelling Fuck the world on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens then it was Bleek
Now its whoever motherfucker yeah who want beef
Now whenever motherfucker who wanna see me
In the coffin body exhausted resting in peace
You dont want war nigga you want peace
So give em the piece capisce let em rest in peace
From West to East the flow is outdatable irreplaceable
Lyrical homicide hell is hot Im boxing with Satan
And I slipped em the ace so you cannot replace em
If Eazy ever decide to return I remain Jayceon
A king in the making and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin nigga the wait is over
Im gone

She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad

Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad

Picture me snotty nose sittin on my aunts lap
The kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back
I got it from the older folks sittin in the living room
Everybody had cups stylistic song boom
But then came Darryl Mack lightin all the reefer up
Baby caught a contact Im trying to tie my sneaker up
Im missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like Im wobbling look at all these afros
Soon as I thought I was good the jokes on me
I heard a voice get in the room I get angry
Stomp my feet catch a tantrum
Spit scream fuck that
Momma shake me real hard then get the big gat
Thats called the belt help me as I yelled
Im in the room like panting huh huh huh with mad welps
Ragged out bad belt yes her presence was felt
Then get my black ass in the bed its time crash out crash out

Despite the alcohol I had a great old Mama
She famous for her slaps and to this day shes honored
But when I was a lil dude her son was a lil rude
I picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in a nigga food
Get beat then Id run and tell grandman mama hit me for no reason
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin
And felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start cryin when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those the fake prokeds
In the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head ahHH 
Nowadays kids dont get beat they get big treats
Fresh pair of sneaks punishments like have a seat
Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass
And bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash
Thats back to back beatings
Only went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin yo

3442,"Strangeulation Vol II Cypher II Lyrics
For what I wanted to do was take some of my classic beats and send em to my artists to see what they would come up with on these beats that I love so much so I wanna call Stevie Stone and Ces Cru to murder lets go
Feel the hate when they come around
Little bull better settle down
Feel the love Im the great and or the true
See the fakes and the snakes Im always outta bounds
See I been dealt a hand my nigga I can peep
Peeping the shifty fans my nigga
They gon see see me going HAM getting bigger nigga
Talk that shit if you want to hack my Tech N9ne play it again 
Make sure you remember me me the odd ball liquor
When Stevie get to speaking the plot
Thickens with and these niggas is Vixens
Competition its really contradiction uhhuh 
Learning from the realest slim pickings
I love it how you doubt a nigga hound a nigga
Panned out all this profit sought the stone to stand stout
On rigid and rare routes its like procedure to hear a nigga out
Strangeulation two and its right now
Lets take it to another level hot metal black kettle bitch
High pitched fly shit falsetto five words like the bandit lord
I think this weed got me paranoid
Middle finger to my enemies I say all you niggas is bitches
Jurisdiction have so many restrictions
All you niggas is fiction no conviction
Niggas get to dissin Ill have you outta commission
Bodies missing call my brother to lynch em
All you niggas is gimmicks frail body and soul
All you niggas pretending thought that we socalled family
All you niggas can get it turning my volume up
Had us upon that midget
Let me hear you say names let me hear you holler Strange
Octane with flame will leave your bodies decaying
Niggas be playing games my niggas taking aim
Have you in a debacle better stay in your lane
Guess timell tell guess timell tell guess timell tell 
Right hand over my heart of hearts Im pledging allegiance
To Ces for whatever the reasons I have withered the seasons
Theyre dead in the breeze Im ready to feed em
I never believed em you son of a bitch son of a preacher word of
Heaven and Jesus through seven degrees of separation is still
And spreading diseases my recommendation is cheddar your cheeses
Maybe you better get business like I didnt know that I carried the load
I know your boy is heavy and heaving
Thats word to Strange and Tech the N9ne I mean who better to lead us
Since I been with that team I been spinning them Gs
Bitch yeah you better believe it cash come in a bulk amount now
Im staying ahead of my dreams so the fuck could I sulk about
For real Ill never be satisfied still I dont be vocal out loud
Respect is due I show it dont blow it my records are outbound
Chill Im choosing my weapons wisely we never will lose direction
Guide em through the Recession Proof should include a confession truth
Started from the Bikini Bottom were here but its something fishy
Twenty sixteen Strange Music making some fucking history
I know they want me to put up the pen
And just quit with the rapping it wont never happen no
For the minutes that I been in it Im a killer still in the back but Im clapping though
In a matter of fact I been acting so
Out of wack and my brain is on overload
I dont call anybody aint nobody calling me
Maybe I dont need a phone no mo
Guess I wont pay the bill and the villain is spillin venom in him then Im a goner
And haters are catering to me with wishes that I wouldnt win any longer
Idiot youre just making me stronger wanna kill me then pay me no mind
Get a record thats quite a bit longer if you dont feel me then get on your grind
I dont mean to be mean but the measure is simple when you try to weather the outcome
Now I dont need a reason killing any season in fact I am better without one
You dont know anything about heat or the temp of the weather that Im coming out from
And I wouldnt consider you equal like other people where the fuck is your album
Shit to you is a hobby and obviously yall aint knowing to measure at all
Murdering it for pleasure aint fucking with Godi Im sick with a medicine ball
Couldnt give em a shit not even a little bit cause they haters we know it
We all know the location come get your face winched

295,"I used to be a rich nigga selling much crack
To make a long story short I fell off like a hubcap
My operation got shut off
I cant slide a slut off
I gotta beat my dick to get a nut off
Cause when a convo is struck up
Bitches act stuck up my luck sucks everything is fucked up
To get cash I gotta beg
Cause every time I reach in my pocket all I feel is my damn leg
Its about time that I feel cash gotta get it right now gotta get it real fast
Cause all I got left is two MAC10s a army jacket a ski mask a hoodie and some black Timbs
Im about to get extra ill so I went to my crib got booted up and got dressed to kill
The first place that I hit was the corner store
I pulled out and told everybody to get on the floor
I took the cash and I jetted
One kid tried to set it
I bet he regret it cause because he got wetted
Robberies I did well
When you look in the dictionary under villain youll see a photo of Big L
Fuck a job punks is gettin robbed and scarred
Cause times is hard on the boulevard
Yo I was robbing people on a regular basis in many different places and all types of races
I robbed gangstas I robbed ducks I didnt care who I stuck as long as I got a buck what the fuck
When niggas see me they take flight
Ill even rob Jehovah if I catch him right on a late night
Keep a vest G dont try to test me
A redneck police chief tried to arrest me
Ayo that wasnt a smart cop
Because I put 2 in his chest and his motherfucking heart stopped
Its a must I commit crimes
Cause I gotta get mine its hard times and all I see are dollar signs
Why should I work for another sucker
When I can do robberies and make Gs like a motherfucker
Fuck a job punks is getting robbed and scarred
Cause times is hard on the boulevard
Yo I was goin out just like a crusader would
I robbed everything that moved in the neighborhood
Yo I was even robbing chicks
I did mad sticks I needed more dough so I started taking hits
Blastin ducks with the shotty
The trigger I squeeze with ease I got paid 50 gs per body
In a year I killed 88
So I made about umm fuck it I was crazy straight
Fuck a job punks is getting robbed and starved
Cuz times is hard on the boulevard

Blow the spot like tea kettle whistles
Federal slugs the leadll kiss you
Infrared burnersll never miss you
All digital hard physical spittle you riddle you
Priest prayin over your body while you in critical
Come in a few give out a doz this what the semi do
See what the Henny and Rmy do
BGF Black Gorilla Family jet Black Godfather finesse
Fifty caliber hole surroundin your chest
Bentley blue steel armored cars with boulder baguettes
We live in effect blaze a gun while poppin a Tec
Recognize killers nigga pop a collar to that
Gorilla breed to the death thats the shit that I rep
Code of silence addicted to havin fattened the violence
AK47 rapidly firin got love for bloodshed and the sirens
Take banana clips to my gun to keep my shit off balance
My heart filled with malice
Yo if you livin thug holla back
My bitches strippin in the clubs let the dollars stack
This ones for all my OGs and street scholar cats
And if a nigga act up funeral parlor cat
Pop a collar to that
Yo wavin cash gun in the stash the click on smash
From rockets that blast yo we in your pockets for cash
Burgundy mask bullets like a surgery slash
Internally burn your staff and dismember your ass
Coroners bag from autops to medical lab
I leave you leakin like Carlito watch your memory flash
Quicksand for fam tied a fuckin brick to your hands
Im sicker with the Henny liquor with the clip to your man
When its on its on do your moms bodily harm
Firstbornll be your first gone beef goes on
Permanent cash put you in the tourniquet fast
Feed you glass and use you to fertilize the grass
Puff green when we fiendin to murder ya whole team
For cream the infrared beamsll shatter your dreams
I flatter your queen and rip her right out of her jeans
Intervene and its the homicide scene for your team
From hideous acts on the one gettin rid of the gats
A nigga back no parole now how pretty is that
The city is trapped bottles popped Phillies is cracked
Niggas is strapped half bent illin spillin they gnac
Cars tinted my rap image too large to mimmick
We mob in it fake niggas dissolve in minutes
Its codes to it real killers they know music
Even hoes on the low at the shows lose it
Courvoisiersippin this slim nigga stay flippin
My ways different duck when the AK spittin
Its more to it verbal wisely all fluent
In real life this is how the dogs do it
Doubleedged sword rep for yall seein the board
See yall home soon its better than seein the morgue
So whats the conflict who wanna Don with this
For the streets strictly we got the bombest shit
Two violent niggas sit at the round table in brown sables
Chains hangin down to the navel
Brooklyn and Queens connect get down fatal
Hold the fourpound stable
Wont hesitate to rock a clowns cradle
Get put in the dirt like ground cable
Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval
That shit yall spit sound fable
American Me style knife in the anal who round to save you
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with a gym star spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggas out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit for me to let it rip across your attic
Never valid with a salad but I toss your cabbage

214,"On the Black Caesar tip my dialogue is just like
A frank inside of a supermarket raw dog
Im the untouchable never to be took out
A Sexy Mother ooh child Prince look out
Im keepin girls of all shades on my trail
From a Sister Act down to a Single White Female
Cause when I hit the skins they all say Damn Kane 
You knock out the Bush like a presidential campaign
But if you think that lickin toes makes me weak
You better treat me like Freddy Krueger dont sleep
I write raps ready to rip and rock real rough rhymes
Run in rugged and raw rapidly ruinin roaches
Point blank I spell murder to a bum
All you backwards rappers REDRUM REDRUM
Cause I do em somethin awful break em down to a morsel
Makin sure that youre no longer adorable
Rappers get so quiet when Im comin that if they
Shitted a dictionary you couldnt get a word from em
Its sort of a tradition in BedStuy to do or die
So steppin to me is suicide
I couldnt think of a rapper takin mines
I feel like Ali Im the greatest of all times
Floatin like a butterfly stingin like a bee
Yeah I know this aint boxing but thats still my pedigree
But as for you you have no appeal
How you get a record deal
Like shelltoe Adidas aint a damn thing changed
The way I shoot off lyrics like a firing range
Breakin out in a cold sweat the death threat
Gettin more props than a movie set
The smooth microphone assassin rhymes keep blastin
Uh I keep the body count massive
But if you say you increased the Body Count troop
You must admit that you joined IceTs group
Cause you aint hurtin niggedy nuthin so why you bluffin
Tryin to be the new Big Daddy Something
But theres only before me no one is richer huh
You couldnt come Pryor if your name was Richard
Cause Im the Alpha and Omega
ArmLeguhLeguhArmHead stayin raw til Im dead
And to battle me you shouldnt even try
Cause with wings on your tongue you still couldnt say nothin fly
And I dont care if you bring a crew
And I dont even care if someone else writes for you
Man you could even be someone the crowd may just like but shoot
You couldnt see me with a bifocal mic
Check my resume Rapmasters Word Up
Yo MTV BET The Box and all that good stuff
And Billboard for my five year duration
And see that I got more spots than a dalmatian
Lets get down to finish this large
You could bring on your whole squad none of you chumps are hard
All that garbage you mumble aint real and seriously seriously
How you get a record deal
A lot of rappers today wonder
Should I ask Kane to write rhymes for me to say
Well youre goddamn right you should
Cause my rhymes are like spandex they make any ass seem good
So act like you know Baby Pop
When I riggedy rock the higgedy hiphop nonstop as I
Freak the funk and flip the flavor to flow with the flyest
A fury full force in the flames of the fire now
May these MCs rest in peace
Because when I come to town the population decrease
I leave em finished dead and thats that huh
Not even Pet Sematary could bring em back
I slay my prey they decay I tell em like Jennifer Holiday
No no no no no noooooooooooo way
That you could ever touch this no you know how I feel
I think you bought your record deal

Ayo depending on the day and depending on what I ate
Im anywhere from twenty to thirtyfive pounds overweight
I got red eyes and one of ems lazy
And they both squint when the sun shines so I look crazy
Im albino man I know Im pink and pale
And Im hairy as hell everywhere but fingernails
I shave a cranium that aint quite shaped right
Face type shiny I stay up and write late nights
My wardrobe is jeans and faded shirts
A mixture of what I like and what I wear to work
Im knockkneed and got a neck full of razor bumps
Im not the classic profile of what the ladies want
You might think Im depressed as can be
But when I look in the mirror I see sexy ass me
And if thats somethin that you cant respect then thats peace
My lifes better without you actually
To everyone out there whos a little different

You can call me ugly but cant take nothing from me

You know Im well known like Al Capone fully blown like Ton Montana
In a zone sittin on chrome stoned sippin on champagna
Rollin ganja up in bible papers see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ John Elijah Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream
Bustin out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard  medallions
Mockin God even Italians see my batallion pull out the broad
I got the Squad overqualified pullin over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted threewheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
Theres something I want to tell you I want to tell you 
Theres something I think your crew should know
Big Pun is the largest So large we straight out of the projects
Thats how we roll Thats how we roll 
I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat
What you broke motherfuckers know about that
Lookin fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly blown Benz chrome rims
Shinin like the stone gems on my gold rings
I got it sewn Twinz I cant begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
Ive been a killer and a drug dealer a bugged nigga
But now Im like Puffy cause moneys thicker than blood player
Im still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together
And figure which cleaners the best for the hit
I get the job done Puns handlin business
Candlelight dinners havin a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses
So expensive my whole familys religious

Big Pun is the largest So large we straight out of the projects

Aiyyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
Long as my crews official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
Im tryin to triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God Full Eclipse and myself thatll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
Im on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin
Im infinite like math so Im gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day bullshit and sittin on your ass
Im all about cash and the power
A stash with the power that lasts like hittin ass for an hour
Lets get it locked I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops we got Deserts and Glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryin to stop our cheddar from stockin forever

663,"Genabis
This is Genabis remember this
In the beginning I discovered wordplay
I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day
On the fourth I searched for the words to say
How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space
I was perfect at it and mastered the tactics
On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics
On the sixth day I became a fanatic and I couldnt kick the habit
I would just look in the mirror and practice
On the seventh cycle I had to take the day off
I was exhausted I guessed my work will never pay off
But if it happened it to Him it could happen to me
And if it happened to me it was destined to be
Yo Genabis Exobus Levitibus
There aint a mic on this planet Im restricted to touch

The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Genabis Exobus Levitibus
There aint a mic on this planet Im restricted to touch
I read the cosmos what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
They backslide back to church and call a ministers bluff
They rather remain unenlightened then listen to Bus
I blew the fuck up even though it was short and abrupt
I was the first rapper to ever to close orbit the Sun
One small step for man one huge step for mankind
I am the red giant of rhymes
Solar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second
Flow is untested those that Ive threatened fold under pressure
At 120 beta cycles high volts ignite your eyeballs
Until you see the fire in front of you
Optic cones rods melt one at a time till you realize you in Hell
Rip the Jackers not done with you
I terrorize the rap community with impunity
Blow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris
What my enemies want to do to me is old news to me
Those in pursuit of me will never get through to me

Genabis Exobus Levitibus
There aint a mic on this planet Im restricted to touch
I read the cosmos what God wrote predicted as much

First rapper to speak over beats dogmatically
Mixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy
My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly
Look at the Victorian tapestry in back of me
Notice the post renaissance pictures I drew
Hand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca Peru
The followable audio propagates the possible truth
For proof Im the illest so the choice is not unto you
See the standard ideological definition of a rap model
Puts Canibus in scholarly periodicals
The article is substantially impressive more than a message
A working thesis from several different perspectives
The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap musics tentative
Entered apprentices this is Genabis

Nevermind I do that often Ive risen often
Bust out my coffin Im a livin abortion
Battled the Devil and deaded his demons
Trained other beings to be in his different levels of Hell
Still screamin

3270,"Holiday 2000 Lyrics
Yeah
LOX nigga
It dont stop
It keep goin and goin and goin and goin
Motherfuckers
You heard it from the P you oughta know its the truth
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like its only a rap
Cause when these bullets hit yo ass Im like its only a gat
I need a funeral to feel good Im hoping its yours
Think he religious Heard he got shot in the Cross
Holiday Styles bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche or flip to the boots stick to the truth
Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missing a tooth but both of em chipped toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble I start most of the shit
When I squeeze aint no controlling the wrist
And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowing to Swizz
Im an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack bust guns pop shit and say Im better than niggas
You think not Ill look at your man and level a nigga
If you think a rappers better why dont you give me his name
So I can run up on him tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets Im the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters but Im bigger than yall
If I left the gun home Im a give you the sword
Im the devil in the flesh I cant give you the Lord
It dont make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib you oughta pray for your wife
Uh huh holiday
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
Holiday
And I dont care if I sell yall know what I sell
Holiday
I use my left hand when Im loading the shells
Holiday
Cause I know it aint right thats why Im blowing the L
Yo
I do it all for my niggas even ride with a bomb
Get shot die in his arm and give him my last
Its a million dollar bail Im a get it in cash
I sell crack like its 88 I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun live in the Maz
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple fifties of hash
Hundreds of dro wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor catch me right next to the dog
Im Holiday Styles and thats what the weaponry for
And I probably wont blow for the fact that Im hard
But Im good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Getting jewels from the old timers stashing the cards
But jail aint part of the plans
I keep weight on the scale cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash em up the boy mighta went platinum but dont gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut
I dont deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes I dont make mistakes
Double R now bitch you oughta know Im a ghost
Blow up your face blow up the coke and blow up the smoke

2762,"Desperate wait for those in a desperate situation
Homeless and hungry
Having stands displaced reliant on aid
disaster may be unfolding right now
It has been hit by a earthquake
Yes how many gorillas who actually killers really rhyming
Artists that actually signed still killing
And when it comes to killing the mic theyre not willing
And Im supposed to be shook Thats the shit that kill me
Take the bullet for Barack on the balcony then vanish
Extinguish the sun when I drool play pool with the planets
We are renegades the movement outlandish
My shit straight from the soul goddammit
Its the one time only vernacular original
Miraculous spectacular flow computer digital
I piss upon the pitiful ridicule the minuscule
Pharoahe Monch need to park that ass like municipal
And listen to an enigma
The anomaly your momma nominated me phenomenal
I dominated without a sixpack abdominal
You could get 19 put through that like Amadou
So what Ima do is separate the false from the truest
Youve amassed nothing trying to ball like UMass
So phenomenal with mics I dont like myself
Sadomasochist MC I bite myself
But not cameo though theres no Grammy to show
For the love that people hand me on the street now overstand
Grade school mathematics examining thugs
They discuss Bloods Crips techs jammin and drugs
I speak of world peace war famine and flood
Watching Pans Labrynth while Im unraveling bud
Gambling on the next rapper to die in the hood
If God shall choose that artist to be me
Let one verse of a song be a reflection of a pedigree
Better than your back catalog recipe
The legacy by which the entire world remembers me
Quote do not edit me let it be said
Im top five all time Alive or 
We know thats misstated and so overused
So heres an overview of why Im six feet over you
And a million fans think this statement is so overdue
And pardon if it sounds a little wheezy
Not Wayne motherfuckers I got asthma its not easy
Shotgun lyrical cock back squeeze me
Women case my anatomy touch me tease me
Please seize the moment in the struggle against Lucifer
Renegade 13 the Executioner
Spit with a crucifix
So that you can expect a rant from Pharoahe Monch like Mucinex
Get used to it get used to wisdom
Get used to usage of a backward euphemism

Oakland
Oakland California
Oakland california is the city of snakes
Pimps pussies players and fakes
Loud mouth bitches who talk too much
Dick teasin bitches who never fuck
Sucka ass nigga fake as hell
A man or a bitch I really cant tell
Some of you niggas need to quit
Show and tell nigga you aint shit
Sayin I got this and I got that
But when it comes to you I got no rap
Cause what I see is good for me
And what I dont know just let it be
Bitches gamin workin extensions
Her hair aint really but two inches
Bald head girls in the Oakland world
Short afros and jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald head and say go to hell
But your a snake your a worm
Bald head bitch you need a perm
Oakland california is the city of liars
Fresh barbed wires with vouge tires
Niggas tellin stories twenty minutes long
And everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I dont wanna know
All I want is stereo rock
Homeboys kick it gettin keyed
Sold that mark some fake weed
Told that nigga here you go
A big fat sack and you know its premo
A 20dollar bill went to your hand
You rushed that money to the coke man
To the coke bottle was the next stop
But you broke the bottle and cant smoke rock
Base rocks base rocks thats your daddy
You better off smokin on a powdered cabby
Have a white christmas everyday
Cause cocaine cabby is a too short way
Thats Too SHORT
Smoke more coke than Richard P
Have more money than Michael Jackson
Oakland can I get some action
Hey young tender in the 501s
I love to see when you work your tongue
Suckin my dick in the back of the car
Rollin down Skyline boulavard
I said beeeeeeeyach
What are you smoking
A big fat dick in the big East Oakland
I see my homie he needs to quit
Holdin hands with a bitch who looks like shit
Maybe Im wrong by what I say
Maybe that nigga is gettin paid
Maybe that nigga aint bein used
Gettin fucked without collectin dues
Thats how I work all the time
Im Too Short baby got a fresh new rhyme
For Oakland California thats the place
Homies got drugs all in yo face
When the OPD cruise down again
Niggas goin half off dubes and tens
On any corner anywhere
Buy your drugs from a Oakland player
Niggas sell squat callin it top
Cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
Crime went down murder went up
And some of these turfs are tryin to get tuff
Whos the leader of the hour
Anybody livin if they push power
M16 357
Sendin these niggas to hell not heaven
So much death in the Oakland streets
Your nothin but a target sellin weed
You know Im rappin the honest truth
Niggas roll up shootin guns at you
Threatening your life and calling you fake
Till you take your drugs to another state
And sometimes man its a pity
Cause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city
Niggas who take do you know yourself
You must be the nigga with all the wealth
Maybe one day you can own this town
If everybody fucked and you are down
Thats how you see it I do too
But I break bitches and you break crews
Oakland California is gettin tough
Niggas got schemes for coming up
Niggas got ways to make big bank
Hittin these streets like an army tank
Im Too SHORT
Spitin more game than youll ever speak
music for 10 seconds 
I got more bitches wantin me
Cause Im the best dam rapper from the Oakland streets
Im the coldest MC on a microphone
Oakland California wont leave it alone
Cause Im on this mic rapping that game
Knockin off tapes like Im selling cocaine
Fucking these freaks indefinitely
I never stop fucking you Oakland freaks
High school bitches really like
The way Sir Too Short can rock the mic
Oakland California thats the place
Freak freak bitch got a lot of ways
She got big fat titties size 38
Imma fuck that bitch but I cant wait
The young girl makes my body boil
When I fuck that bitch imma drill for oil
Imma put cocaine all over my dick
And tell that bitch its time to lick
East Oakland thats where I live
The city of the freak freak freaky bitch
I spent the night with her she aint mine
I fuck that bitch so many times
And that right there I could never fake
I thought my goddamn dick would break
Fucking too much makes you hurt
But I never stuck a bitch from puttin in work
All you bitches can suck me dry
Suckin my dick for the rest of your lives
Ok baby here we are
Were just two young freaks in the back of the car
You are one whos the other
Its Sir Too Short that rappin ass brotha
Everytime I talk to you
Whatcha wanna know is it still cool
And everytime what do I state
Your still my bitch thats everyday
All you bitches cause Im a hall
And you baby girl my freaky doll
Im too short baby now Im smokin
Another big cabby and Im in East Oakland
Not the west not the north
Its the eastside baby Im Sir Too Short
I can spit a rap and ill create
A sucker MC everyday
Niggas from Oakland young and old
Runnin round here keep off that dope
Singin my rap at the skating rink
Sucker MC do you know what I think
You wanna be me so damn bad
You wish that you could make my raps
When I say Short you say your name
Tellin your homies you rappin game
But I sell tapes and niggas know
You singin my rap in stereo
Some of you niggas aint really shit
And Tony G is just a bitch
Why does Tony rap like me
Cause he aint no pass high 
Just sleep to the world on what I do
Grab a mic front you
Tony G you just cant have it
Nothin but a little lightskinned old faggot
Tryin to rap on the mic
But Too Short baby is what they like

1732,"I dreamed that I was at a club scene where all the thugs be
Every criminal mug be living in luxury what the fuck G
That must be Bugsy in the black tux over there with Lucky
Bring my heater niggas might try to slug me
Take me out in back of the club and buck me and touch me
I felt a hand tug me then turnin around I peeped the lovely
Fly face fat ass gave me a glass of bubbly said
Compliments of Bugsy then took me across the persian rug to plug me
He shook my hand and hugged me thought he would do me ugly
But he dug me pockets chubby said Nino where them drugs be
Over there by the derby buy they dirty devils from me
To keep my paper sturdy yo word G
I aint afraid to get my hands dirty you heard me
I be D and fuck all that living thirsty so Nino
Do his out in Jersey showin no mercy with Frank Nitty
Who else and some nigga with a Babyface that they called Nelson
Bad for your health Machine Gun Kell and your Dillinger
Death messenger known to carry the six cylinder
Look for my army fatigues to Giorgio Armanis
Holdin the Tommy no one can harm me Will and Tommy
Tried to alarm me and quote he turned to smoked salami
Dead as a motherfuckin zombie full of my ammo
With Bugs Mirando against the grain so gotta send him
Over the rainbow he must be brain slow caught him down
At the train po in Santo Domingo left him for dead
Two bullets in his Tango like how that movie Shane go
Frank Costello hostile fellow he murders while remainin mellow
But most of the niggas on his team was yellow
Cold blooded veins flowin with red Jello
Theres Joe Adonis had mad dramas wont hesitate
To put you in pajamas fly hooker fine as the Pocahontas
Beauty queen youll wanta pokherhiendas
Frank broke a promise between the organized crimers and old timers
Costello gotta go six below nobody voted no
To veto so they hit him with a hollow torpedo
Up in his torso he aint a boss so he can go
Without ever lettin the whole police force know
Lex Diamond was scheamin on Capones scroll
Wanted to own his whole zone it leaked out
They shot him at a pay phone
With the big chrome his whole wig blown
Blood flowin from out his flesh and bones
At the wake at the funeral home its havoc
Family got hit up with automatics
Nonstop static inside the rackets
Jack McGern was burnin split Joe Adonis cabbage
The underworld was goin savage
Pretty Boy Floyd was nonvoid unemployed he destroyed shit
With the Infamous click wasnt to be toyed with
Mad jealous of all the liquor sellers
Shinin with wine cellars turn em from hood dwellers to Goodfellas
Me and Nitty was like bank tellers nothin niggas could tell us
We drove all over I pushed a shiny yellow Testarossa
Moved on it closer get the toaster
Started to feel like death was closer I hit Capone hard
Murder him and his bodyguard in they car and dust the chaffeur
Beef over I blew him like a supernova
Niggas nicknamed me The Black Cobra
The Lady Casanova yo Im even deadly when Im sober
Act like you got a chip on your shoulder
And blast the two right through your boulder
Money you didnt know they shoulda told ya
Nigga you fuckin with a soldier wake up and smell the Folgers
Niggas out here done lie in piss to cover up the odor
Operations from here to Minnesota to Dakota
But yo here comes Greasy Thumbs who wants to get the easy funds
He whispered in my eardrum
Lets take over the entire city and split the dough
Me you and Frank Nitty and Siegel and thatll make the bank pretty
No doubt before we go we gotta murder John Torre
Yo get all his territory dough and end the story yo

2755,"America the ugly raped my mother
Deceived my sister separated my brother
Murdered my children hung my father
Now they want me to rock the vote the fucks why bother
Seen the commercials for they army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said Never
My minds too sharp my brains too clever
My spine is too strong every line pulls your lever
Limitless rhymes for the indigenous the remedy
Plot gettin my money like the Kennedys
Flip it put em in stocks collect indemnities
Rock roll behold my epiphanies and
Read em and weep heat em I beat em to sleep
Mislead em til we even Steven defeat em with freedom of speech
And let em know that Im the motherfuckin firestarter
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort whats real
Only truth will set you free
Id rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
We dying over black gold they harvesting the sand
Presidents living marvelous they starving in Sudan
Its obvious you walk a blind path to oblivion
The book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon
Light my fire start my engine
When Pharoahe becomes Moses its medicine for who listens
A veteran with a mic bringing prophecies to fruition
Motivational verses under adverse conditions
Youre caught in the mainframe Ive seen the maze man
They watch you from the street lights you and your main man
The bar code around your neck same as your name brand
Youre lost in a strange land no thoughts of a game plan

Id rather die on my feet than to live on my knees

654,"Bis vs Rip Lyrics
The Ripper echoes
Dear Boss
I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track
Yo you fucking hate me you fucking lock me in the basement
And you still want me to protect you it doesnt make sense
CanIBitch I supported you like a weight bench
Without me youre defenceless you better face it
You aint show me love when you was at your apex
Getting paychecks up at the radio with DMX and Flex
Catching wreck while Noreaga was catching his breath
I had to keep the situation in check
Look at the varicose veins in my neck Germaine is the best
The industry fucked you Im just paying em back
Whats the matter with slaying jackers Thats all Ive been doing
Besides talking shit I aint done nothing to em
They just mad cause when I see em I dont run up to em
Between me and you yo you know I run right through em
Calm down
Who you telling to calm down nigga Im a ripper remember
I told you not to do Gone Til November
But you wouldnt listen I always had your best interests in mind
I wrote all your best lyrical lines
If it wasnt for me youd be writing pitiful lines
On stage if you was tired I was spitting sometimes
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
I would just be quiet stand to the side and let that shit ride
But Im getting tired of having to remind you Bis
If it wasnt for me nobody wouldve signed you Bis
What Rip Why you tripping you know its a crazy business
You a lying ass bitch and you know it
Group Home was part my company I coowned it
If its one thing I learned in show biz
Stay focused and dont quit Rip
Why you talking bout old shit
Germaine you fucking water brain
Dont you understand fuck the mainstream
You should just call out names
The industrys all about game I shit on em all the same and I leave spit stains on their brain
Like liquid chocolate spilling over their new white trainers
Insane is an understatement Im Satan
Canibus is a Mason I dont know what the fuck Germaine is
I just know that both of yall are trying my patience
I dont give a fuck about a beat Ive been rhyming for ages
Rippers are dangerous all jackers are afraid of us
You wanna face me Bis Kick a rhyme
Thats ridiculous aight then listen to mine
I jump in a costume impromptu just to rob you
Put the nozzle to your eye ball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out through your nostrils
Bury you next to shark fossils make it impossible to find you
Depths that Jacques Cousteau himself wouldnt dare to dive to
With goggles oxygen bottles and Doppler effect modules
Lock you in a time capsule smash the console
Shit on you in reverse and suck you in a brown hole
Suck the power out of your soul
Youre nothing but a coward in the cold freezer with a hour to go
Watching my Casio stop watch counting it slow
Like drug lords checking to see if its talcum or coke
I can kill you by drowning the globe
Or I can just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in your throat
In battles Im a thousand 0 I silenced the Pope
Do you know how many rhymes Ive economically grossed
No I thought so neither do I
Its a dick between your mothers thighs divided by pi
Im the sickest linguistically illicit lyrical misfit in the business
And probably in existence Whats your consensus
Study my own syntax statistics since 96 with CPA certified assistance
I made a decision that my standards are above precision
The only thing I can honestly say I love more than women are dope writtens
If it aint dope then dont spit it
Dont be sensitive and get on the defensive just practice your penmanship
If you cant spit at high temperatures then just quit
Be careful of the tongue it tends to bend to the left
According to manufactures specs youll make a mess
And rupture the blood vessels in your neck fucking with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disk
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversion kits
With a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
You never experienced work like this Bitch
Welcome to the serpentine world where I spit
The world where I twist the world that I rip the world where I live
Okay Rip you made your point I cant outrap you
You said you was the illest I would never doubt that too
A lot of these rappers is jealous thats why they attack you
They think you the best thats why they wanna battle you
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
You are the illest alive thats a fact that you proved
Just a couple rappers dont want it to happen for you
Ragging on you like battling is all you can do
You didnt sell enough units to be honest with you
Nobody knows the truth you got talent out the gazoo
When niggas first heard you it was like Man on the Moon
You got dissed by a legend but you damaged him too
So what if the ladies think hes more handsome than you
What happens if the rumours about being a faggot are true
Look what its running into
I dont feel like having this discussion with you Im tired of fucking with you
Niggas in the game dont wanna do nothing with you
Bussing with you going one on one with who
They wanna get rid of you Shit is too lyrical
Headhunters out to get you Thats why I had to protect you
I wouldnt disrespect you as another intellectual
Without you Im unsuccessful God bless you
What makes you think I left you or why Id ever be tempted to
Ever since my third album Ive been mentioning you
I got your name on my arm Im representing you
You Rip the Jacker I would never question you
I respect your opinion as a professional nigga
I just want you to listen to what Im telling you
What happened between L and you forget it
People know you won the battle they wont give you the credit
A lot of people dont want to admit it
But I consider it a real privilege to bear witness to your lyrics
And be involved in sharing the merits Im forever indebted
I just need you to chill for a second
So I can send a positive message like 2Pac before he left us
The author of the work ethic Genesis
Has inspired me to write the ExeBis scripts as a constant reminder not to forget Bis
But Ive reached a precipice remember Rip
You cant rhyme forever theres always somebody with better shit
I keep you out the public eye for a reason
Youre a commodity Rip aint that how you wanna keep it
I keep your whereabouts secret
I bring bitches to the crib every weekend so why is you beefing
Aiyo stop patronizing me you despise me
All you wanna do is steal rhymes from me
You constantly keep me behind walls of concrete
Lock me in the basement like a fucking zombie
If I was a priority youd acknowledge me
You aint shit neither you aint got no college degree
You cant rhyme without me stop smiling at me
Give me the keys to the garage I need to borrow the Jeep
Get the fuck out my face Bis

3102,"Cruising down the river dancing till your feet got numb cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement parkah memories of BobLo Island
All is your world aint nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut Just jealous of everybody thats headed out on that BobLo boat It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks Aw man I wish I was joining youa little cheese and crackers a little Cana wine a little Riunite on ice some Harveys Bristol Creambut lets do this only on Smooth FMÂ 
Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this handmedownshit I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me antibitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back fore I was born
Pop told stories bout it that would last for hourslong
And as a family we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the BobLo boat
Uh on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the BobLo boat
Thats where I lost my virginity no condom though
Thats when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the BobLo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics thoughBobLo boat
Hey hey hey lil Craig come here Aye hit this nigga Nigga dont worry bout what the fuck it is just drink
Yeah yeah yeah
Some of my better times I shared with you
I shared with you yeah
Shit all of my better days I shared with you
I shared with you shit
And now I gotta wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up
Shit stuck inside a rat race fuck 
Rat race fuck fuck 
Wake up wake up wake up wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race fuck 
Yeah look
Twist the cap lift the bottle back swig it
Dig it teninch rims on my mamas Civic
Teninch woofers in the trunk to be specific
They bump rattle the license plate plus the windows tinted
Dont even give a fuck that its dented bitch Im the man now
Im rolling driving it slow as if its stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci lets check her
Double Ds like doubledeckers I wanna sex her
But these keys dont come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college Im under pressure
Im not a real nigga til I undress her I gotta press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My reallife trauma
Plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but thats insane it couldnt be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap you never heard it better
Give me a sec I murder sectors prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it but it spill out I gotta chill out
Say Fuck the world and never pull out
We had no BobLo boat
But I could note those times just like a Bible quote
BC before cell phones the first time I would smoke
I was six years old but thats for another chapter
Thats for another story to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking bout dumb days
Thinking bout dumb days


This is 808Ray
Nigga dont worry about what the fuck it is just drink

Lord higher
Could somebody turn on da lights
Somebody turn on da lights
The darkside Yessss 
Guess whos back when I bring funk like Zapp
All aboard motherfuckers while your brains get jacked
Im souped like two scoops of funk juice word to mother
The way I kick you swore that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker
The darkside brings apartheid
I act wild like them niggas from ChiTown on the Southside
Sweeter than this whoopin niggas down like Jack Nich
When I backflip my tactic graphics
Ooooooh Redman jams it in
Due to difficulties I wont be done by ten
Friend I got bust shots out the twelve Benz
And then we get the bambazee from oneten
Or is it further up Plus my style murder ducks
So what the fuck you got the mic turned up fo
When I Chief Rock underground MCs drop like sheet rock
Heres a ride to the underground
To the beat yall
Ah to the beat yall I do the freak yall
I keep the buddha to last me through the week yall
Ah to the beat yall
Ah to the beat yall I do the freak yall
I keep the buddha to last me through the week yall
Come take a trip on my cosmic boogie movie flicks
Far beyond space so niggas say your grace
Its a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzeneggar
When a baby I had other babies in labor catchin vapors
With two gats I move like too fast like Paxton
Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action
Black stars or moons eclipse the volume
Bang zoom Im sendin honies on the moon with ten bags of boom
Ridiculously I will rip an MC
To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox check the synopsis
I grow confusing just like Rubiks cube boxes
Float like the butter fly so what if I
Blow your lenses tear the fuckin hinges
Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahhs than a dentist
When Im in this the knottyheaded era causes terror
Yall gimmick motherfuckers better get yall shit together
One for the money and two for my peeps
Nynex cant even reach my technique or rap sheets
For the Squad I lick two shots word to God
Then take yall dreams and imaginations
To the darkside

2695,"Most the time when it rain it start pouring
But how we grind it make the weather change for us
repeat 3x 
We roll through but we never change for em
So smile for us when you see us drive foreigns
Nigga watch us ball
Stop or stall nigga not at all
Im poppin broads with Tiny Hog at the shoppin mall
All money in the squad boy Im not involved
Cant pay the cost to floss I can spot your flaws
SLs with the toppin off
Dress well when its time to ball
Couple hundred for my boxer drawers
Young nigga used to shop at Ross
First to shoot when its poppin off
Couple times a nigga almost got popped by Ross
Crash unit buzz cut exmarines
Crenshaw Slauson Ave 17
Infant Stone Lil Shady Baby Bolt Da Fatts laid a demonstration
85 Cutlass with the 380s
Summertime functions LA streets crazy
Shoot it out thats what this crew about
Hangin out the Cutlass window with the Rugar out
Prove yoself killers in pursuit of clout
It felt wrong but who is you to doubt
Look my master plan was buy a pound and then move it south
And hopefully one day Ill put this music out
Trippin now seeing that its movin out
Im buying spots nigga movin out
My fan base I see em movin south
Im overseas eating fuckin crote
Yeah so I can tell you what this hustling bout
I couldnt tell you what no luck about
I had maps on my wall nigga
Dope sacks in my drawers nigga
Look a lot of stress I couldnt rest not at all
Nigga risking everything trynna ball
Gotta let it breathe
And put the weed out
Double M
Niggas get it and they fall off
Its cause they all soft
Nigga like me started at the car wash
8am to 10pm thats on the rainy day
Wise words from dope boys meant everything
They say its levels to the street life
Then I seen a bezel with the pink ice
All natural momma tell you to be careful
In the trap trappin to increase capital
No longer cruising with the windows down
Hand on the pistol anticipating the riddle sound
Im Kanye when it came to ye
Im JayZ when it came to keys
Im Snoop when it came to weed
So now they wanna Biggie me
As the credit rolls now the charge is federal
Money bags Im placed upon a pedestal
Still on the block in my Reeboks
You aint really know these was the Basquiats
You aint really know who really call shots
Worldwide mastermind number one all charts
Reporting live from the land of the hopeless
Representing for the team that won rings with no coaches
We stay strapped and we cockin so dont approach us
Price Johnson with a big gold chain and Louis Loafers
Been hiding guns in the sofa since toy soldiers
Thunderdomes up in Hyde Park didnt nobody know us
We took all fades our introduction was from the shoulders
We was kids honestly we just needed someone to hold us
Grindin hard on them corners with cane boulders
Fascinated by the green all we wanted was Range Rovers
On the block politicking with brain blowers
Real niggas that got love in their hearts but cant show it
We live and die for the fame and the lights glowing
Fox Hills buying Jordans but still the pain showing
When I die put me next to the dead poets
Tell em God had a plan for me and I didnt know it
Victory

Bam
Bangbang baby

Trizzie check it out now Yo 
Im rated X in sex I flex like Lex Luger
So whos next to get scooped up by this roughneck from Cuba
We do maneuvers like Super Dave always with a group of babes
Laying mamis out like Sugar Ray
Cause Cuban Link dont play games miss I flip and do some strange 
With you like hit you with the whips and chains check it
Ill get you naked like Im mystic cause this is
Thick as a brick long with big that fits it
Now lets get physical my jiggable pie
Let this lyrical guy scuba dive right between your thighs
I satisfy like a Snicker bar cause Im the pickup artist
Thatll stick you quicker than a spicll strip a car
My repertoire holds a four star performance with all women
Hittin more skins than Alec Baldwin
Youre fallin in love and you cant get up
Now check the cut I stripped ya now you cant strut word up

He cant work the middle cause his thing too little

Word up patch thug three quarter front Polo jiggy
Be like Who is he lookin like a grizzly
While your girl watch me youre busy drunk pissy
Wanna lay the love but your love wanna kiss me huh
I got a fly team me and my guys gleam like high beams
Makin a killin off of fiends with pipe dreams
It might seem like Im conceited with the cream talk
But I got the kind of green that could bribe a Supreme Court
When we talk the whole world listen
Turn your back to TS for one second and find your girl missin
Baby make me holla take it off I give you dolla

1300,"Six in the morning police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make my escape
Didnt even get a chance to grab my oldschool tape
Mad with no music but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck my pistols close at hand
Im a selfmade monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hiphop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didnt know what the cops wanted didnt have time to ask
Word
Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told em bout my morning cold bugged em out
Shot a little dice till my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies said we all werent shit
As we walked over to her ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didnt know what hit her didnt have time to ask
Word
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a Louis interior
Solid gold the ride was raw
Bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Seanesean was the driver known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin off like a highschool bell
Looked in the mirror what did we see
Fucking blue lights LAPD
Pigs searched our car their day was made
Found an Uzi fortyfour and a hand grenade
Threw me in the county highpower block
No freaks to see no beats to rock
Didnt want trouble but the shit must fly
Squabbled with this sucker shanked him in the eye
But just living in the County is a serious task
Nigga didnt know what happened didnt have time to ask
Word
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Hen Gee put me up the track
Told me Es rolling Villain BJs got the sack
Bruce is a giant Nat Cs clocking dough
BeBops a pimp my old freaks a ho
The batterrams rolling rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said Man you out early we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy he didnt waste time to ask
Word
I bought a Benz with the money the rest went on clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didnt want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew some punks got loud
Shotgun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit two punks died
All casualities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didnt know who they were no one had time to ask
Word
Swatteam leader yelled Hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my fortyfour
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the backdoor like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didnt even see us they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadnt done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops woulda shot us on sight they wouldnta took time to ask
Word
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed
One more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real it was no LaDiDaDi
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing sixty one police car spun
And all I was thinking was murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew were gone into the night
Broke to my old ladys who drew me a bath
She didnt even know what happened didnt care didnt ask
Word
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission thats what she was
If there had been a crowd she wouldve got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
Then she backed off and teased me so I couldnt cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop while I was screaming for more
After she waxed my body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def she didnt waste time to ask
Word
Up the next morning feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my AMG
Hos catching whiplash trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when Im in my car
Was my homeboy Red some say hes insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said hes jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didnt know where we was going didnt care didnt ask
Word
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he woke up chilling in NYC
Called up my posse when I got there
Hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devils nest the rest we passed
Backdoord the Palladium just for class
About 4 am we crashed the deuce
We never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shootout jumped off nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning we didnt wake up to ask
Word

491,"Verse 1 
Frigid frozen Minnesota
Chip on his shoulder
Sick sleeping on a pissy sofa
Unwanted visitor in a different culture
Missing home and he cant go theyre civil warring
Listen solider forget getting over
Prisons sitting round the corner homeless is even closer
Kids with similar skin color still dont wantcha
Spit and insult ya cause theyve been here longer
He leave his crib he guaranteed the pigs approach ya
Where ya going where ya from any weapons on ya
Your family is stressed out youre getting older
You dont live the way they did back in Somalia
Its extra difficult to be a daughter
Trying to keep it modest with sinners all around you
Where the wrong garment your parents get an ulcer
If you wrap it up the other children picking on you
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Verse 2 
Holidays and you know what the business is
You get two birthdays and two Christmases
Older you get you resent how sick it is
Theyre trying to cover their guilt with the gifts they give
Bounce from his house to her house
Too bad that marriage didnt work out
Now you dont have a your house
Daddy fighting mommy they both tell me they love me
If I get to close to one the other one start acting funny
Ma went and had a baby with a different dad
You act happy to please em but you are really sad
Seeing first hand that family that you will never have
Plus you aint no real brother youre just a half
Got to pick up the pieces and move on
Bed time stories and greet them on the phone
Live in two houses and neither one is home
Wishing you were grown have the freedom to get gone
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Verse 3 
Daddy was a preacher momma was a Sunday school teacher
Big brother football squad leader
Now far be it for you to disappoint or displease them
Your just being what you feel you see in
That mirror every time you peer in
Swallow the tears inside that empty feeling
A boy terrified to let the world in
He has girlfriends but doesnt want a girlfriend
He retreats inside himself
Where he lives life itself in secret
Daddy says people go to hell for being
What he is and he certainly believes him
Cause there aint no flame that can blaze enough
To trump being hated for the way you love
And cry yourself to sleep and hate waking up
Its a cold world yall shame on us
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes

Obviously intolerant

And the thousands of pieces will pound them with ease
And the standin around so the thousands is doubts
That are out emcee cowards grab on my counts
Till they out in they galaxy out in the clouds cuz the honor of rapping is marvelous gorgeous
Jump down for dying you talk to em bout but they answer I just wanna party and bounce
They sing along dont make me think too hard I just came here to relax in my drinking form
Dont make my brain work too hard I need TPR

My favorite Martian I feel like Im speaking to him
All of my peeps if you do not mind keeping your
Light to yourself because we out here seeking dark
ness
Im like I could just beat you boy
You dont want spirit
You might just want ouija boards
Youre the reason hip hops making me sleeping more
Until you try to battle then you peepee your pants
And you fret cause youre keeping your stance
And you stand there just leaking from dances
Im speaking advanced from my speaking youre bad for an album this outcome I once tell em done and to keep your advance

Zoomin a lot Im as potent as stabs from cobras fangs
Corroding the back of your brain exploding your veins
And growing your skin where rappers are flowing again
Its over for emcees lacking attacking Im notable
End these after I smack em
Im over the feeling actually rapping
They know when Im here to razzle and dazzle opponents
That fear the boldest and coldest of opuses
This is copious diss Im blowin these kids to bits
With ritz
I wouldntve said ritz and kids if it wasnt for hieroglyphics
My rhymes are extensions of all my influences
Combined and mixed together in lyrical bliss
ya smell me 
Here Ill give you a whiff

and still be

Dont care about your damn zodiac sign
Or your country of origin

Hanging out on corners singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble or anyone wholl give me some

Didnt know what my life would be In the ghetto 
I was dumb and oh so lazy In the ghetto

While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto but you cant take it from me

710,"We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didnt matter
Kaclow boom pop Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I aint afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you I admit I had issues
Like ebony your essence your pedigree your presence
Its more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust lets shake off the dust
From the cloth
Oh youre worried about when people stop and stare
Thats just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same cloth you just want to wear
But thats just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la la la la la
This is tailormade love fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so lets have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you the good word I read with you
Looking at things that weve been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Lets stay in the present no time for second guessing
You said its this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it thats so unexpected
Yeah thats the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
Cause whats inside of us no need to outsource
The cloth
Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights tight never smother
Its two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
Its two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
Its two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever

Grit my teeth spray till every niggas gone
Got my block sewn armored dope spots
Last thing I sweats a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll hops
You try to flex bang another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause theres no way out
Why Cash money aint never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose much to gain
In my brain I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight you muthafuckin right
Pickin my grip check my bitch keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock think Im a movie star
Nineteen I got a 50000 dollar car
Go to school I aint goin for it

Here I come so you better break north
As I stride my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothin bout you and thats evident
All I loves my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy Well it isnt
The ends justify the means thats the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets checked a grip and now I got clout
I had nothing and I wanted it
You had everything and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine my success came speedy
Got me twisted jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get another brother drops
Maybe thats the plan and I dont understand
God damn you got me sinkin in quicksand
But since I dont know and I aint never learned
I gotta get paid I got money to earn
With my posse out on the ave
Bump my sounds crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare Or the American dream
So think twice if youre coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens childrens screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You dont come here much and ya better not
Wrong move bang ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what some motherfucker gets shot
Thats how the game is played another brother slayed
The wound is deep but theyre givin us a band aid
My educations low but I got long dough
Im raised like a pit bull my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk lie like a politician
My Uzis my best friend cold as a mortician
Lock me up its genocidal catastrophe

1923,"I aint got no home aint got no shoes
Aint got no money aint got no class
Aint got no friends aint got no schooling
Aint got no hurt aint got no job
Aint got no money no place to stay
Aint got no
Programmed inequity its in the nervous system
Listen watch the words how they twist em
Two thirds of the world turned victim
Subtle energy they capture and block chi
The unseen violence behind the democracy
Some call it hypocrisy turn freeman into property
And logically justify not treatin em properly
Invisible ink in the constitution
Meant to preserve the institution unequal distribution
Of wealth goods and services
Revolvin door no floor just anxiety and nervousness
Trapped in circuses
Herds of us not understandin our purposes
When appetites and psychological types
Get caught in the hype its tight from morning til night
Im demanding my rights
Womens suffrage then black suffrage
Or Jim Crow the KKK
American terrorism
Murders and beatings on television
Its in the cells now you thought that was yesterday
But the compression stays trauma still got most afraid
Stuck in the memory fear gives birth to lethargy
Generations of children in jeopardy
History written in jealousy scribes full of heresy
Full of barbarians chchcheck out my melody
Musical therapy reprogram
Africa full of coltan
Coltrane was a cold man
Black genius in a cold land tryna be the whole man
Heal the homeland
Past time for our own land
Where a grown man can be a grown man
The system has benefit for robbery is robbery
You cant run from it God is a natural monopoly
Divine creator stuck in monotony
Bureaucracy psyche on poverty
Selfesteem broken like pottery
No more not me codename anomaly
Cause theres just no match for the prodigy
Sovereignty the god in me
Walking university living cosmology
Without apology
Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you you you
OK
The more you suppress life the stronger it gets
With death life the longer it gets
I know its hard to admit
That you follow some bullshit
Swallow the wrong pill looking for mr bill
Repression oppression same thing same thing 
Fear the shadow thats the main thing main thing 
They keep running from
Every action yields an equal and opposite one
Yes that means the consequence comes
Fields of cumbersome back breaking labor
Cant be healed with just a cummerbund
I was homecoming queen call me number one
Yep thats another one now give the drummer some
Tell every mothers son expression can be far more powerful than a hundred guns
See my Kalashnikov lyrics with the safety off
Now dance around these niggas like Baryshnikov
Street sweeper my words are my keeper
Its in the ether now what you trynna tell these preachers Its done
Its done let loose your tongue
Gifted black and young
Watch these devils run
They knew a change was gonna come
Sinner man looking for a place to run
Tell the truth in tongues enemy reduced by ones
Thousands 2 can put 10000 in flight
Speak truth to power every 24 hours
Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you you you
Ay let me tell you 
Imperialism is a form of Jihad
They killed and enslaved millions for gold bullion in the name of God
The children of mammon called it spiritual famine
Can we examine how they stole bauxite rubber labor diamonds and platinum
The building blocks of society and economy broke humanity to build the colonies
Using reverse psychology to keep us from knowing our quality
No more human tragedy no more misrecognition no more addiction
Lets accurately diagnose our condition
Listen
400 years of the abuse and misuse of religion
Dont give me another persons prescription
I need what I need my deeds are my deeds
As a man thinketh so is he Mezanmi
Take the land back every child woman and man back
Reevaluate history expeditiously
Cant live my life in apostasy
Emulate the apostrophe hang with S you can rock with me
I come in love and truth truth 
Look at what I went through
Now its time to acknowledge just what I give you Life
Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you you you
Theres a whole lotta wrong to be righted I get excited
Ima kick this shit off like Im on Manchester United my attention is undivided so you cant divide and conquer me
Im sitting comfortably in a SUV up in my SUV taking artistic liberties
Making musical history a lil acupuncture structural integration my meditation liberating a generation beyond that Im taking the bomb back Im splitting atoms for freedom America needs more FREED men able to talk right not prone to GREED men Its just not what you need man 
Let your words and deeds line up master the mind young king man put your signs up intelligent designs up plant your seeds keep your dimes up cuz no man knows when the times up
Its elemental like Solomon in the temple Ark of the Covenant accountable to a higher government
Im looking for love in all the wrong places 
Somebody tell me where them brothas went reclaim your wealth no more giving the enemy help no more sympathy for the devil letem hang himself
Get all the billion Black people out of these bottles suffer while grown people get coddled you know the novel
Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches

1311,"Upon initial contact with IceTs music I had envisioned him to be an illmannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon shocking sexual audacity and repulsive images of the ghetto
However after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle
But to make things more plain and simple to the layman I find IceT to be the dopest flyest OG pimp hustler gangster player hardcore motherfucker living today
To be honest Im totally and completely on his dick

3159,"You know they always say man its tough being at the top huh
I couldnt agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position Im a chess player
And if I did Id just shoot my way out
First born to my momma
I come from the place where youre promised
To die before your 21st
Youll be surprised whats underneath the earth
Dug dirt I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I cant sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks Im a known threat
God fearing yet Im evil though
I think deep I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body
Then you know why I took my gun and headshot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
Its either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU
Fuck you hey I been running this shit so long
My MO is like fuck you
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
Ima reach out and touch you
I aint gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe bitch pussy nigga fuck you
I live like I spit it
Raised by the wolves so my mentality is get it
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like its business
A weak nigga facing time go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team cause he aint wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge thats your key of dope
We all wanna eat gotta feed folks
Took an oath on the streets called a G code
Thats what we live by die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have fiveKones gun killers
bust that nigga fuck that nigga


Fuck you hey I been running this shit so long
My MO is like fuck you
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
Ima reach out and touch you
I aint gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe bitch pussy nigga fuck you
They jealous of me cause I shine bright
My grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit this is music you can driveby
Gs the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another niggas hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he aint keep his word
He aint fooling me my nigga he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune he aint seen a bird word

1950,"My Aunt Dot
Left a Glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up then she hit the streets
Even though Im her niece she copped me a piece
Wackass caliber nickelplated with the silencer
What She dont know I like my guns pretty
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twinglizzies
I heard a knock at the door knock knock knock knock knock
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you
Whattup Im Shanice dont remember me
She called me by my government name Kimberly
Who sent you
My mom sent me her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie
Hmmph she was cute and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack with the hat to match
Bvlgari hiking boots with the mink bubblegoose
And I could see she was admiring my mink ski suit
Then she handed me the note
Here read this
I just stared her up and down
Cause I couldnt believe this then I opened it
It said Bitches is out to get you
Your socalled friends put a bomb in your Benz
Im on a mission now to do some harm to your friends
They know where you live so evacuate the crib
And oh the little girl thats your cousin Shanice
Since I cant be with her I need you to babysit her
Besides she looks up to you youre her idol
And tomorrow is her first violin recital
And she would be more than happy if you could take her
Peace my numbers on the back of the paper hit me later
Damn what went wrong
Cant we all just get along and make hit songs
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show yall hoes would get gonged
Cause if its on then its on bring it on
What the fuck you waitin for Cmon lets get it on
What Whats takin you so long I got plans for the future
To bring back your head like Medusa

How Laverne she always wanted to be like me
And dress like me and look like me

And last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha
She planned it all come to find out her name is Keisha
Cmon Shanice Im takin you to my house in Alpine
I wanna go with you Uhh be quiet and well get along fine
Cmon please I wanna be just like you
600 Mercedes and 380s in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barrettes and
Hclass rocks inside my Baby G Shock
Fuck Barney and Lambchops I dont love them hoes
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes XandOs
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil Nique and Jus then take em to ToysRUs
Make em spend they cheese then kick em out and take the bus

Then I picked up the phone to call my Aunt Dot
So she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm nineoneseven eightfiveeight twoonetwotwo
Hello Yo whats the deal
Why these bitches buggin out

See its sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They dont want you to win no more
Soul Train they dont want you to attend no more
And I guess thats why they aint your friends no more
The other day when I was comin out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door
For real Yup then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat
Then I dumped her on a deadend street
The other two Yeah they still linger
But dont you lift a finger Ima get em
So just pray I come home
And when we hang up get rid of your phone
Whoo When Aunt Dot comes oh brother
Its like five Bloody Marys one after another
Hmmph she have you stressed no wearin white no sex
And when she get vexed you guess what happens next
Cause them other two girls thats still on the menu
Is the reason why the story is to be continued
Girls be actin stink and mad funny

Brownskin fine I drink her body like wine
And throw the wax on it and watch two cheeks shine
I drunk a forty Im up in here feelin naughty
I like the gogo girl go head work it shorty

Im in paradise caught up in the booty world
And for you regular honies tryin to play fly
I aint no Chemical no Bank in your human eye
I like my spot everybodys butt naked
Pump with Gstrings watchin hot momma shake it

Now you a lady mature and Im rubbin on ya
I got my Phantom mask Im on the dolo
I slipped in my tip in and bone a sweetie look like YoYo
She had a good time knees bent in the chair
She said Get wild I like it when you pull my hair
I gave her cream and rubbed it on her black boots
I see a packed house in different color body suits
Im in the front row chillin on the down low
Checkin her dogstyle shes scoped by an ass pro
Im from the back kid smooth with tons of grease
Denver and Texas and Cali on back to East
She hittin switches and watch she make it lowride
Zoot zoot zzzzzzzt

Watchin Goldie lapdance that grey hiney aint no slum
I gets my workout my slickest hand from every angle
Shes on the job right cutiepie sippin Tango

Im comin straight up and not for a breakfast meal
This aint no Burger King this aint no White Castle
Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle

Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline
Im pullin nylon yo dead up G to the side
Feelin soft flesh Im hard Imma let her ride
Jump up and down get live like House of Pain
Leavin em so wet the silk with a tan stain
I reach a climax shes happy with her orgasms

And if the mood is right we gon do it tonight

How many niggas out remember the
First time they try to take a girl virginity
And through the bullshit you lost your identity and lost your cool
Cuz you aint know what to tell all your niggas at school
I had niggas making bets like did he fuck her yet
Ask her did he touch her bra when I say nah they say aw
So tomorrow I use that pressure to undress her
But the more I caress her more I feel like a molester
So I wait for the day I deserve it
But every time I go to touch it then she say I hurt it
I cant even talk sex and then she say Im perverted
And then she say Mase why we cant wait what I aint worth it
It aint that but girl you never say I go too fast

Til her body feel weak then Im fallin asleep
See I aint talkin bout these primadonna bitches you meet
I need a girl that if I ask her handle me and my peeps
Get down dirty and lick ice down my butt cheeks
Then she wiggle then I giggle then she feel my nut seed
And if she give my dick a kiss probably give her clit a kiss
Then I hit it from the back then I yell whose shit is this
Then I go so hard that she need her guts fixed

2381,"At times I dont know who I be
And when I look in the mirror its like I dont know who I see
Am I even moving at all
Cause I swear I cant tell if my life is improving at all
Every time I got a pen in my hand
I forget every time before that one has been in my hand
And I write for the moment get it tight how I want it
Get the right lawyer on it cuz I might wanna own it
I tussle and I fight I hustle and I write
I struggle every night with every muscle in my mic
Im in this rap race trying to eat the cheese
But yall dont know my name like Alicia Keys
My face aint familiar neither is my music
If shit dont soon change I be the one to lose it
I drink a little liquor tryin to heal my nerves
Cause yall dont listen here and feel my words
But somethings wrong with yall aint nuttin wrong with me
And happy in my life is what I long to be
And happy in my life is what Im gonna be
What you see in me is what I was born to be
From the day that my moms first birthed a child
She didnt need the world to make it worth the while
So I dont need no magazine to reach the pinnacle
Screw a review and you can eat the interview
Cause thats what yall seem to tend to do
Them cats you cover all seem identical
Through it all I weave like the Parkers Hair
And shine underground cause its darkest there
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Yall industry niggas should be feeling ashamed
Yall like he aint still in the game we stealing the name
Oh wait just a sec thats straight disrespect
If you take shit and get and dont be late with the check
Im on the underground trying to scrape and scrounge
And sure it feel good to take a break and lounge
All these ups and downs like a roller coaster
Life is a bitch Im trying to hold her closer
Im killin every nigga in sight
The bigger the dog the bigger the fight
If you really say you know me then youd figured I might
Try to use my anger as a trigger to write
I put it down simple on the paper or pad
Try to take a stab at what is making me mad
I jump on the track and I ride it through
And do it for the people that are tried and true
But yall so fickle yall love me today
And tomorrow love another cat and shove me away
But most aint committed to do it how I did it
In the way that I did it in the way that I spit it
Its like my burst of truth and it might hurt the booth
But first the proof it gave birth to youth
Raps like trying to take a piss in the wind
Im just glad to know that some of yall are listenin in
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song

2162,"I keep dwellin on the past babe
Know what I need yeah
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
Its better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldnt be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies
Some on the fence some befriended me
But when we see each other its gon be some weird energy
Im sorry that we couldnt make it work
Believe in your heart I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking bout thats supposed to be you girl
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But whats a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without em
Need solutions less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain feel the pain inside em
Kinda lost need someone to guide em
Its nothin worse than feelin alone
But Ill admit to feelin better when Im hearing this song it goes
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
So I dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat baby
Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me

Dont wanna be a player TS 
I dont wanna be a playa no more

But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Whos down to crush a lot
Hey yo Im still not a player but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah see you later Im gone
Penthouse suite Penthouse freaks
In house beach French countess ten thou piece
Rentout lease with a option to buy
Coppin a fiveoh Benz for when Im not far up in the sky
Puffin the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin PJs
Now we reach the peakage runnin trains for three days
Who wanna ride it wont cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My my Im big huh I rip my through your hooters
Im sick you couldnt measure my with six rulers
Hold up chula Im all about getting loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get HOOF
I dont wanna be a playa no more

But Big Punisher still got what youre lookin for
Uptown baby uptown

But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Whos down to crush tonight

Fat and breasts highly intelligent bachlorettes
Thats the best I wont settle for less
I wanna ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
Its hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional Im let you know
Once I put the blows get your clothes cause you got to go
I could go downstairs little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty Twin I dont care
Round here they call me Big Pun if you with the big guns
Thick tongue known to make a chick come 
In the hot tub poppin bubbly
Rubbin your spot love got you screamin Punish me
But it dont stop watch the Pun get wicked
When I even Luke be like Dont stop get it get it

Like the candy bar bitch everyday is PayDay
Like the candy car bitch the chrome lady got the way
Fittin to hit that Miami Pimp hort and Jazze Pha
We got to the beach the ground was so sandy
Bitches on my dick like ants on candy
She say she want to choose say she prime time
All I really got is pimp game and some dick from behind
No pay no play thats me
No promo concerts no dick for free
No freestyle sessions cause I dont waste rap
And Im a show you how to put you pussy hole on a map
Swallow the pussy everything you see
Pussy buys me cloth pussy buys me weed
They treat me like a king they all want to crown me
I live by the pussy cause its always around me
I put him in the mix like a blender
You aint pimping if you aint gon send her
If she brings you back some money shes a winner
But if you pay her man you cant say you pimped her
If she want to choose you got to tell her whats your fee
These bitches got to pay to sign up with me
Cause pimps and hoes we dont fuck for free
We get paid and live the life of luxury
Im a show you what to really do with that ho
You a real live whore fit the prostitute more
I could see you with that lady master piece on your wrist
Put you on my DVD sell that pussy on the disc
Its better then fucking for a dinner and a movie
Your pussy going platinum bitch the game is too groovy
Thats too much game for these bitches trust
What you gonna do with that pussy Bitch
You can buy some new shoes with it
You can buy a house if you know what to do with it
But if you give it away you know what
Yous a punk ass bitch ho tramp and a slut

496,"Go ahead and wager that you never listen to another song of mine
I cant say I blame you either
Cause if you made records you aint gonna catch me listening to that shit
But if you do I just want you to know I didnt make this to hurt you
God knows you done hurt enough
Just I dont know try to make some real shit you know
Bye you aint never gonna see me again
If I can help it little fellow take it easy
Fresh out of forced tears kisses and hugs
You about to lose the company your misery loves
Aint never did nothing but try to kill your disease
At least help the symptoms instead you infected me
Im not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you gotta draw at all then its time for you to scram
PS you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
The struggling I did with you was all for nothin
It was never enough your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginnin
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didnt think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my mama
Since you never listen to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head
I dont love you I dont think I ever did
And if you hadnt tried to kill me Id stayed for the kid
X 2
Theres nothinmore for us to say
Got my mind made up Im walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to you story someday
Round and round and round we used to go
I never fucked you right or made enough bread I know
If Im such a bastard and mistreated you so
Then how is it youre losing your mind to see me go
Truth be told I held you together
For all them years and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor took in your mama
When she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama
You got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is suppose to live
Sick twisted and vindictive with your windows dim
Baby youre not wicked hard bull fish you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that youll ever be blessed with
Unless youre twisted demented and depressed and shit
And alone cause you faithfully slayed your friendships

Nobody knows Nobody knows the insides and out yall
What Im goin through Nobody knows whats behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
What I feel inside Nobody knows about the dreams bout the dreams
Im catchin a flashback of the days when
My pockets were dry I only had a few friends
Those same brothers now my family
Weve been through it all in this industry
Mad frustrated ready to flip
Because the company was playin me like some dumb kid
Video out and Im still ridin the train
Workin and hustlin no pain no gain
Now here comes the spotlight still somethins not right
I gotta pay my rent by five oclock tonight
Livin on fifty cent noodles
But Im playin the game that the brothers know Im true to
Cant let up although the journey is rough
Focus on the goal like its the Stanley Cup
I gotta play this thing for keeps
My only stress relief is the hiphop beats

Lookin at this world with mad anger cause its wild
People thinkin that Im blowin up
But they dont understand the young man is growin up
Now who you think I should trust
Better rely on self no time for missin the bus
Fake people phony characters
They begin to swarm so I built up barriers
To block em out but they still dwellin
Makes me wanna just start yellin
But I play it cool though cause Im no fool yo

Just spent my last on a 40
To sip away my troubles now its worse cause Im hungry

Im more wetter than your boy vigor

I should own a fly bitch house and a Benz

3358,"Distraction Occupy Wall Street Freestyle LyricsNowadays we be rocking glasses for fashion
And fucking with life a fraction
Covered in Max Factor hustling assbackwards
As sure as HiTek look like Richard from Last Dragon
Your focus on bogus rappers got you caught up in distraction
Distraction Who fucking who Who cares Thats distraction
You wish it was you dont you why you asking
Try to break the law of attraction
Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your blood and you believe in the immortals
We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder
See the water drawing away from the shore
This aint no ordinary storm
We killing for a humanitarian cause
But have yet to show up in Darfur
The Arab Spring is what its called
But its looking at the pride before the fall
They say it aint about the spoils of war
But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost
Steal the land from the Native American and call the missiles Tomahawks
Make him a mascot dress up like him for sport
As a final assault to his beautiful culture
Scavengers feasting on the dead like a vulture
Snacking how you keeping up with my rapping
You barely keeping up with Kardashians
You caught up in distraction
Its the living proof you try to make the truth elastic as Mr Fantastic
We recycling these rappers
Truthfully these niggas is plastic
Coming through the front door blasting
I aint talking bout them emails
That you always send to the masses
That somehow end up in my trash bin
My niggas got the aim of sharpshooters and the hearts of assassins
All this war all this life all this passion
The game is distraction
Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin
Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in
Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters
My deep cuts way above your minor infractions
Talk to rappers like children cause thats how they acting
They holding their hands like minors in traffic
The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo
Have a deepseeded fear of change
For them its strange they wanna go
Back to the 50s they asking for a return
But them days is much blacker for lack of a better term
We adapted to the times but this culture we had to learn
Came about as natural as a perm on a pachyderm
These fascists have had their turn
We packing them German burners them Lugers
The next shooters waiting for Superman they get nothing but Lex Luthor
Americas nightmare vivid as Fred Kruger
Our heroes are dead to us
Spirit that bled through us
Endear us with the spirit so the flow is so foolish
What you hearing is precision
The people so thirsty what they seeing is mirages
But this passion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages
Coming through like Collossus
Exposing the false prophet
Taught how to do the knowledge so Im never offtopic
A lie is like a potion
First it gets you open
Then you swallow whole straight for the truth
Fuck the chaser skip religion and the politics
And head straight to the compassion
Everything else is a distraction
",got the aim of sharpshooters and the hearts of assassins All this war all this life all this passion The game is distraction Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters My deep cuts way above your minor infractions Talk to rappers like children cause thats how they acting They holding their hands like minors in traffic The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo Have a deepseeded fear of change For them its strange they wanna go Back to the 50s they asking for a return But them days is much blacker for lack of a better term We adapted to the times but this culture we had to learn Came about as natural as a perm on a pachyderm These fascists have had their turn We packing them German burners them Lugers The next shooters waiting for Superman they get nothing but Lex Luthor Americas nightmare vivid as Fred Kruger Our heroes are dead to us Spirit that bled through us Endear us with the spirit so the flow is so foolish What you hearing is precision The people so thirsty what they seeing is mirages But this passion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages Coming through like Collossus Exposing the false prophet Taught how to do the knowledge so Im never offtopic A lie is like a potion First it gets you open Then you swallow whole straight for the truth Fuck the chaser skip religion and the politics And head straight to the compassion Everything else is a distraction,Distraction Occupy Wall Street Freestyle LyricsNowadays we be rocking glasses for fashion And fucking with life a fraction Covered in Max Factor hustling assbackwards As sure as HiTek look like Richard from Last Dragon Your focus on bogus rappers got you caught up in distraction Distraction Who fucking who Who cares Thats distraction You wish it was you dont you why you asking Try to break the law of attraction Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration Or a measly little morsel They suck your blood and you believe in the immortals We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder See the water drawing away from the shore This aint no ordinary storm We killing for a humanitarian cause But have yet to show up in Darfur The Arab Spring is what its called But its looking at the pride before the fall They say it aint about the spoils of war But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost Steal the land from the Native American and call the missiles Tomahawks Make him a mascot dress up like him for sport As a final assault to his beautiful culture Scavengers feasting on the dead like a vulture Snacking how you keeping up with my rapping You barely keeping up with Kardashians You caught up in distraction Its the living proof you try to make the truth elastic as Mr Fantastic We recycling these rappers Truthfully these niggas is plastic Coming through the front door blasting I aint talking bout them emails That you always send to the masses That somehow end up in my trash bin My niggas

Ayo ayo ayo ah
Yeah
I hate rich niggas god damn it
Cause I aint never had a lot damn it
Who you had to kill Who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top damn it
Or maybe thats daddy money escalator no ladder money
Escalade new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause Im bad with money
Crooked smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I aint tripping
Nigga Jordan and I aint Pippen yeah
Up the steps I aint slipping
Tears blood sweat and I aint cripping
Heres a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you aint alone shit
When your momma aint at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit bout your steppops
How he was a dog now look at you
I aint bad as that nigga plus dawg Im a grown man now
I aint mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
Id be glad its that nigga nigga
Did Kay dirty now its back to broke
Refund checks used that to float
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Couldve drowned but I grabbed the rope
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing you got what I want I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna

But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie dont quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now know you felt the shit just now
Aint there more to you Dont it ever get boring to you
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this aint the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched lil Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
Its like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got and now a nigga dont paint the same damn
I guess he cant complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame my brain the same
Yeah nigga at least he aint insane
At least he aint insane
You aint crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change
Thats new maybe thats true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Mnages
Just one bitch dont feel the same no more
And Henny dont really kill the pain no more
Now Im Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I cant maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money cant save your soul
But there go you
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing you got what I want I got what you need

You been hangin around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin like in Memphis Tenn
Get it girl I like the way you bounce

They know this extendo we got on us
Cant name a time when its not on us
Hope they try robbing us
So they can go back and tell niggas about all these bullets they got from us
I let that blocker unload I put that pot on the stove yeah
Now these CDs only product thats sold
Fans in Berlin going out of control yeah
I fuck a lot of new hoes
Penthouse on top of the Lowes Versace my robe
Whats in my pocket A knot I cant fold
Make sure my gelato is rolled
Uh I am on a whole nother level than you uh
My grandma used to say Boy you got the devil in you
Fuck around get some metal in you
My name ring bells I could sell out whatever venue
For us by us
For us by us

For us by us
For you By us
For you By us
For you By us
Im tired of hearing bout what all these rappersll do
First of all none of yall could last in the booth
I dont know whats faster your wounds turning black or to blue
The media to slap or to sue
Step to a nigga just to step on a nigga
Sounds easier to me than counting backwards from two
Bring the hood piece you expect to buy the Benzes
Shell catch an iron you aint pressured by forensics
Half these niggas rhyming transgendered
You said it gotta question how you meant it
I transcend forever monumented
Not even Netflix could document it
My son got autism from injection by syringes
These nerds aint warriors we heard the same story and
You niggas blowing whistles at Hurricane Dorian
Blowing missiles back to the word of vainglorious
You sissy
Nigga this is for us by us
Why you put yours up Ill put up my cup
Survivors of systems meant to divide us
You only can afford what you could buy five of
You a fool in a war with the faint of hearts
Ill let the tool encore take your brain apart
Im at the Louvre on the floor by the hanging art
Im putting numbers on the board like a game of darts
Product of every single blood freckled Timberland
Buy up every building in the projects to contemporary art deco every tenement
My consiglieres Marc Ecko every sentiment
Cop a hundred rides park em all in one garage
Money on my mind like Rocky thunder thighs
Everybody everybody friends like they from Milan
Til they in a hole in a lawn like the number nine
Long hours of perfecting this 97 shit
Spitting seeds left the shells of pistachios on the keys of the Casios as the evidence
Bearing my soul DiCaprio from The Revenant
Phantom looking haunted like a hayride
Camera on the trunk like the one from my prayers
Amethyst a gun cummerbund child they lied
Glamour chick in front one of one I say I
And you know how I do
Put the beef behind me then put your soul behind you like De La
Twin white Maybachs
Steering wheel wood when Im floating through the hood like sailors
Couldnt be cut like me if you had ten tailors
Put the wifey in a black Bent Bentayga
Judge cant exonerate violate
Got a mansion by the lake got a maid Consuela
I was fly even when I was a damn lie
I was flying standby cause of how I expand mics
Triple threat bitch I make the track and write
The judge cant give me life bitch I am life
You a algorithm
You niggas everything the culture isnt
I dont coach or visit
I dont get into the social digits
I just smoke distribute
Microorganism living my colloquialism

2936,"Gather around the Renaissance man has finally appeared
And Im astonishing rap characters are cause of the tears
Quasimodo and the quotables excrete from my mouth
And no doubt we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the oppositions Abstract bless your soul
There are degrees of MCs but none on the level
Of the other vocalist precious like metal
Makin all my rounds through the towns like physician
I be curing impure emcees plagued with disease
So take a spoonful of Poet Penicillin and
Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance
Rrrap Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
So here we go now
It is the Midnight Marauder on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles way I displayed
How I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there on Farmers Boulevard I made my mark
Two dudes niggas would dip from us me and NARCS
And then my legend would grow on the Atrain line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me Big Pete Tanya and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
So get it in ya head we gon rock the dead
Night of the living MCs the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit Renaissance wont quit
We gon baptize yall for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr Strange
Making cultures move if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin aint gon bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we dont see it as one
We dont quit bullshit and we never lost son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearings impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it its like dynamite
And its the Renaissance Rap


Uh uh its the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uhcause its the Renaissance
Its the RenaissanceRap
It is the Renaissance Rap
Now lookin at ya clock you know that its time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the TOP
That be GOD and I be TIP
The promoter of the flyness witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came but Im the royal highness

3551,"What happens when you combine the darkness with the light
Im bringing pain like two bad nurses
In the pain from these here motherfuckin verses
Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
To the dirt shit first picks and usin autos to work with
Slugs to the shirt shit just to squirt shit 
Im hitting it with an expert kick
And burst til the earth split leave you hurt bitch
Show you how worser than worst get in the zone
See the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin the curtains bitch
When adrenalines pumpin 
I dont understand discussion only hear certain shit
Im a misunderstood nigga and Im off my square
High got me reversin clips and dispersin shit
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge
Im charged up like Scarface gettin shot up on the ledge
No pain instead of caine I took a blunt off to the head
So tell me what it said 
Retaliate with lethal repercussion
I feel the reefer rushin
To go into thangs like its a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl hot like Im finna steal
To get the kickin shit
For niggas and bitches that I kick it with
I was born to get you pumped up
Its like some lead bust
Cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo heads bust when you jumped up
Cause what I said mustve got you geeked
My eyes red puffed
From smokin shit that niggas hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act a bitch on the side
If we have to then the whole Westsidell let the shit go on
And ride when the trigga bust
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his oppositions chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his oppositions chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Pullin up and bailin out like were carsick
Im ready to start shit
Started buryin some heads like an ostrich
Unload the whole cartridge
And throw the shells in the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve
What Ive accomplished
Yung Buks my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
Then set out on a journey too astonished to stomp this
Worshipped in the hearts of all the niggas to get em charged
Whats the real reason
All you haters tried to murder me so now its kill season
And even though Im still bleedin
Ima keep comin because Im still breathin
And yall cant trace me
Im burying my victims in the wall like Gacy too lyrical
And since the snip of my umbilical these flows been critical
My music is miracle its like Im biblical
Kill like Im nuttier than Buddy Love
And still wouldnt leave a bloody glove
And start the truck up
And speed the fuck up
Getaway smokin the blunt up
Adrenaline pumpin veins erupt Im pumped up
And Im calibrated at 360 degrees
See thats 300 niggas thats gon die
Bout 60 slugs to do this deed
Psycho Drama 
We too much for the industrialist to fuck with this
On the brink of fuckin up some shit
Dismantle deduct some shit
Its hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
What niggas got nerves to do 
So I guess Ill just take that fuckin nerve from you
Then think what Im on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh let semi close yo curtains fool
From killin the verses fool
I be one of the worstest dude
You the who 
Im the worstest
Look about 9 millimeters above your surface
Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose
Bitch you hurtin
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his oppositions chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

Pimpin these hoes on the boulevard
But Im not here to tell ya bout me
I got a little story bout a nasty freak
Shes the kind of girl you think about in bed
Blowjob Betty givin real good head
Bust a left nut right nut in her jaw
Sperm on her cheeks is all ya saw
She could blow more head than a whale blows water
Blowjob Betty make your dick get harder
Shes a one of a kind a hell of a girl
A trip and a half around the world
Catch her gettin busy bitch wouldnt stop
Shes the kind of girl thatll make your toes pop
Every time I used to see her I would know whats up
Blowjob Betty better blow me up
I remember the day when I first met her
Bitch kinda loose so I knew Id get her
Walked up to her said

Pimp is my game I do it the best
Ho fuck with me she dont get no rest
Well after that I Ged the freak
I used to stop by and fuck about twice a week
And from the very first time I went to her house
Walked in the door and stuck my dick in her mouth
hort Dogll get bitches anytime I wanna
Got a big dick and lay it right on her tonsils
Only stick it in about half way back
Cause if I put it all in it bust straight through her neck
Niggas always sayin how they fucked that bitch
But Im the only nigga that the bitch made rich
Like any other tramp she loved to fuck
With any motherfucker got nuts to suck
I spit game to the bitch just like this
Why you runnin round suckin all that dick for no money
It didnt take long to stay true to the game
And get my pimpin on
But every once in a while you get a stupid ho
Bitch aint about money and shell never know how to get it
Blowjob Betty was dumb
A fiend for a fuck and a mouth full of cum
She made money for a minute but she loved the sex
So I cut the bitch loose like a old school vet
6 months later Im still a pimp Im still a player
One night at a club she was puttin in work
All you had to do was step up to her
She was in the bathroom sayin one at a time
Wasnt my bitch but she still was fine
So I went in the back room seen the bitch
Slapped her on the head said you ready to switch
And to the players out there
Instantly Blowjob Betty started servin me
Cause the player I am to the day Im dead
I was sittin on the sink gettin some head
It was all so good and much too true
One young freak and a whole damn crew
But then I shot that fatal nut
Must of knocked that bitch on her butt
She couldnt even breathe she was holdin her throat
Me and my homies just hit the door
My homeboy said hort dont worry
But that next day I read this story
A young girl died just last night
She choked on sperm in her windpipe
It was on her face her neck and chest
And were sorry to say theres no suspect
When I saw that my brain clicked
I bust a nut and killed a bitch
It might sound sick it might be petty
But ya never been sucked by Blowjob Betty
Beeyatch
Yeah ho yall niggas dont know though thats it
",dick for no money It didnt take long to stay true to the game And get my pimpin on But every once in a while you get a stupid ho Bitch aint about money and shell never know how to get it Blowjob Betty was dumb A fiend for a fuck and a mouth full of cum She made money for a minute but she loved the sex So I cut the bitch loose like a old school vet 6 months later Im still a pimp Im still a player One night at a club she was puttin in work All you had to do was step up to her She was in the bathroom sayin one at a time Wasnt my bitch but she still was fine So I went in the back room seen the bitch Slapped her on the head said you ready to switch And to the players out there Instantly Blowjob Betty started servin me Cause the player I am to the day Im dead I was sittin on the sink gettin some head It was all so good and much too true One young freak and a whole damn crew But then I shot that fatal nut Must of knocked that bitch on her butt She couldnt even breathe she was holdin her throat Me and my homies just hit the door My homeboy said hort dont worry But that next day I read this story A young girl died just last night She choked on sperm in her windpipe It was on her face her neck and chest And were sorry to say theres no suspect When I saw that my brain clicked I bust a nut and killed a bitch It might sound sick it might be petty But ya never been sucked by Blowjob Betty Beeyatch Yeah ho yall niggas dont know though thats it,Too hort baby Im so hard Pimpin these hoes on the boulevard But Im not here to tell ya bout me I got a little story bout a nasty freak Shes the kind of girl you think about in bed Blowjob Betty givin real good head Bust a left nut right nut in her jaw Sperm on her cheeks is all ya saw She could blow more head than a whale blows water Blowjob Betty make your dick get harder Shes a one of a kind a hell of a girl A trip and a half around the world Catch her gettin busy bitch wouldnt stop Shes the kind of girl thatll make your toes pop Every time I used to see her I would know whats up Blowjob Betty better blow me up I remember the day when I first met her Bitch kinda loose so I knew Id get her Walked up to her said my name is hort just what youve been lookin for Pimp is my game I do it the best Ho fuck with me she dont get no rest Well after that I Ged the freak I used to stop by and fuck about twice a week And from the very first time I went to her house Walked in the door and stuck my dick in her mouth hort Dogll get bitches anytime I wanna Got a big dick and lay it right on her tonsils Only stick it in about half way back Cause if I put it all in it bust straight through her neck Niggas always sayin how they fucked that bitch But Im the only nigga that the bitch made rich Like any other tramp she loved to fuck With any motherfucker got nuts to suck I spit game to the bitch just like this Why you runnin round suckin all that

566,"HAM Remix Lyrics
Excuse me
Tell me who you really really really think is more lyrical
Cause everytime I go somebody gotta see the medical
And everytime I come Im eating everything thats edible
And if you aint already know then who be more incredible
They wanna call me crazy like Im borderline cynical
Cause how I do it and I kill em and I get incredible
And magically do it like this was another miracle
And if you dont like it then you can suck up on my genitals
Tatatatal tatatatatals
Do it little bitch and get up off your little pedestal
And whenever you see me you better salute the general
Cause I will break it down to every single little mineral
Slurp slurp slurp slurp 
Suck up on my testicle again when you see me counting money
Move the decimal again
Bout to cop another diamond out of Senegal again
Everybody saying that hes uncomparable again okay
Killing everything I think we bout to have a funeral
A lot of you niggas be doing whatever you be doing
And I dont even know what to call it just sound terrible
Lower down the coffin see we have another burial
These niggas that be rambling and babbling
I aint hearing them
And everybody know that I be handling my BI
When it come to other rappers niggas know that I be scarin them
Chop chop chop chop
Chop another beat up
Now you see the way I heat up everybody wanna meet up
Just to come inside the building and witness another killing
Then I relax and throw a shot back put my feet up
Every beat that Imma touch Imma lace
Imma never stop even with a muzzle on my face
When Im finished with this sissy Imma leave without a trace
Nigga kneel down better say grace
I go HAM

2713,"Ayo my rhymes be the tightest like bones with arthritis thats tight 
Rockin with the SUB thats why they like us
These crews like computers is filled with megabyters
And Im the new virus in town I shut em down
Sound wack Not the slightest they filled with new surprises
Rap SCUBA diver deep like tuba choirs
Rappers cant handle it Joe just use your pliers
No doubt about it baby I got what you desire
I coulda had way more hose than firefighters
But I choose not to date those roles Im striving higher
I got more game than ESPN
Just walk over to her like lets be friends
Went to her house like Little Pig let me in
She opened up the door with the sexy grin
And then eheh then eheh that was all she wrote
A lotta motion in the ocean throw me off the boat
Like Jonah I want it in a special way
Cause she shine in an extraterrestrial way what 
I said she shine in an extraterrestrial way what 
She shine in an extraterrestrial way ET
Shine shine shine 
Yo that night we both shined like a binary star
I still cant believe we let it go this far far 
This shorty was a forty on scales of 1 to 10 yeah 
Thanks come again I was like I wonder when
It really didnt matter cause yo she had a pen and some paper
put my number down Gimme your number Ill call you later
Just like she said ringaling Hello
ET phone home I played it smooth like a cello
Mastermind the plan and pulled it off like Velcro I did it 
Hit it and now she feelin all funny like a elbow
Why you holdin back She said Im not
Communication is the key unlock
We put our heads together like a Mt Rushmore
I found what I was lookin for plus more
Now with you I wanna spend the rest of days
Cause you shine in an extraterrestrial way
I said you shine in an extraterrestrial way uhhuh 
You shine in an extraterrestrial way ET
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Yo we all know the women outnumber the men
But I wanna play you close like my name was Glenn
Put me in a cornfield Im lettin all ears know
So fly momma shoulda named her UFO yo
She beamed me aboard we headed back to her planet
Outta this world man you wouldnt understand it nope 
Now everybody think Im all crazy and shit
Cant believe I did a song about this alien chick
But its true you can ask Decompoze and Phrikshun yup 
Im known to drop science but this science fiction
Close Encounters of the Third Kind kinda
Broke telescopes like you could never find her shine shine 
Shinin like a Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Now everybodys wonderin who you are
Dont mean to break your concentration if its any consolation
I was thinkin me and you could make the perfect constellation
She said Aint nobody never told me that
I replied Girl cant nobody hold me back
Kick a flow while my man Decompoze the track
You better recognize the signs like the Zodiac Scorpio 
We shine in an extraterrestrial way what 
We shine in an extraterrestrial way what 
We shine in an extraterrestrial way
Homegirl she was outta this world like ET
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine sh

Fuckin up our lives
Ill take a piss in your oil fields
I want some motherfuckin payback so yo
I wanna run for president and the focal point when Im campaignin
Is to put FEMA to work on a plantation at Camp David
Demand payment for New Orleans with the best of swordsmen
Launching missiles at the White House while Techs performin
On the lawn and I just let em burn till deaths confirmed
Laid to rest with worms cause otherwise theyll never learn
Ill form a coup attempt put anthrax through the vents
From out a package I got in the mail that you just sent
But I got a better punishment for these Republicans
Id let em live so they can see us overthrow the government
Lets fuck with them have the first lady beat me off
Till my semens launched then I skeet across her face like Peter North
And I wont leave a doubt what we about when I cream her mouth
Or leave her trout bleeding out on Condoleezzas couch
Ill seek this route without regrets and drink a brew then think of you
Cause if its the last fuckin thing I do Ill
Yeah Immortal Technique Rassy
Nigga I never forget nothing nigga
Fiftyone percent of the World Bank is owned by the US treasury
Robbing third world countries out all they resources and equity
When Afghanistan was fighting the Russians
Reagan and Bush gave Bin Laden weapons and told him get to bussin
We even called em freedom fighters
Financed the cost with CIA imported cocaine
That whole Iran Contra Scandal niggas took the blame
Started a war on drugs
Meanwhile Russias defeated America thinks more oil for us
Take over set up a puppet government Arabs aint bearing it
So the same freedom fighters George W call em terrorists
Poetic justice paybacks a bitch these fuckin hypocrites
Like Bill OReilly rightwingers deserve what they get
Rush Limbaugh drug addict Giuliani sex scandal
I wanna thank white supremacists then show you how my techs handled
My necks nanotechnologically designed
It spits SARS to all you stupid ass execs that capital resigned
I am vindictive faggots
Yeah I got something for you motherfuckers haha
You want it here you go
The first payback that I would accomplish
Id draft children from the Senate and Congress
Pompous religious right made suicidal
When I exposed Josephus for ghost writin the Bible
Making nuclear silos bomb the world with hydro
Chinese dragon sized blunts in Maracaibo
Huh and everyone flashing a gun on a DVD
Id make them niggas shoot it out with NYPD
And every fucker that didnt buy my CD
Id stab the revolution in their neck with an IV
See me own the world Id give it back to the poor
Id give a last name to every single son of a whore
Hard to the core fuck what the game is
Niggas pop on they block but they globally nameless
Id show the hood real gangsters and make em famous
Langley Virginia where my connect for cocaine is
Id make everybody fuckin have the world darkening
I make rap about lyrics not beats and marketing
Replace every raped virgins broken hymen
Holding De Beers reclining while they choke on they diamonds
My designings like Francis Ford Coppola rhyming
Building a universe inside solitary confinement
Id reverse Rockefeller laws and bring Mumia home
And serve the President freestyling offa the dome
A message to the outgoing president
I got a great idea nigga kill yourself
You know its so funny I thought about it the other day
You should probably kill yourself
Why dont you kill yourself
Ahahahahahahaaa

1934,"Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Realizing that theres no place else to go
And theres nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
Cause everybody else is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I cant see because the worlds on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect cause Im morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing Im alive when Im still dead
Limited to earth unable to find out my worth
Cause I cant see past my own vanity
If Im not included then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be insanity
Oh wretched man that I am who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor that Ive only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see its me in the way
What a paradox having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending that Im actually defending
God through my facade dont need material
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him
We judge and condemn just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating were in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cause he doesnt understand
Bringing up those things we dont want to discuss
Why still do evil we dont know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light
Led to believe because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us whats going on will be alright
Oh so repressed so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride Im hiding is whats stopping me
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine ye are the branches he that lives in me
And I in him the same bring forth much fruit
Without me you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem youre traditions have deceived you
Ive chosen you you havent chosen me
Do whatsoever you asking my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name
Teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die Oh Jerusalem please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
Its not the talkers but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Oh Jerusalem

The wrath of Kane taking over your circumference
Destroying negativity and suckers that come with
The weak the wack the worse the poor
I thrash bash clash mash and then more
Blow up the scenery I reign supremacy
You need a savior to save ya so lean on me
Im playing rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp em out like a wanted roach
I slay my prey and they decay I blow away and throw away
So go away cause I dont play
Attacking like a psychopath breaking rappers in half
So feel the wrath
Of Kane
The name is Big Daddy
Here to bring trouble to
The man at hand to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most and boast the loud and proud
The Kanell reign your domain
Yeah Kane 
The heat is on so feel the fire
Come off the empire on a more higher
Level than def one step beyond dope
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
Cause I can never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let em speed around the board like an Astro
Then send em to jail for trying to pass Go
Shaking em up breaking em up taking no stuff
But it still aint loud enough
So Mister Cee let the volume grow so I can flow
Now yo
Juice Crews the family Slick Ricks a friend of me
And Doug E Fresh Stet KRS and Public Enemy
Blahzay Blah you know who you are
The red black and green the sun moon and star
Knowledge of self is being taught here on after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reaching each
With the speech every leech Ill impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb deaf and blindll feel the wrath
Of Kane
Marley Marl break it down
Bring it back Cee
Line by line chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street I gotta rap to
Those who chose to oppose friend or foes
I still dispose and blow em out like afros
So many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yelling and screaming and dreaming but still came out
Off the wall and butter soft to yall
So you waited for Kane to come forth to all
Competition that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position you on a mission
So stop lying and trying to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze as I get warm like a heater
You bite like a mosquito but still cant complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays so you dine on mine
Instead of fronting and trying to be a friend of
You might as well say guess whos coming to dinner
So just quit submit and forget
Huh you must be on some new improved shit
I get busy from sun to sun
Im only 21 and untouched by anyone
No one throws bangs or blows
All foes I keep em running like pantyhose
They get soft and tender front and then surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on your class force team or staff
But when Im in effect they feel the wrath
Of Kane

See Niq Niq drive a car see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin and hes spittin too
Little Deyjah beautiful and Major supercool
My life is over with dawg your life is good to you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
And you can tell everybody this is your song
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind
That I put down in words how wonderful life is
Sit down son
And listen to me son and pay attention to me
Seems like Im the only one that you would listen to
I never knew the time that I aint get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go its painful I already know
The past is the past just learn from the grown
So you got crystal wit you And your sister Precious too
Im proud of you did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
Thats why I was so much harder on you knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer I wasnt much of a talker
Great to see you doin better than me even as a father
Taking care of yo mama overcoming the drama
Your life is wonderful son dont let em take it from you
Keep living it to the fullest treasure it its a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty when its over with forget it


Damn
What up Phil So good to hear from you we missing you freal 
Remembering all of our conversations daily reminiscing you
The hood today they lost can tell they dont know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear its so unfair that Im right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I cant rest and I cant do shit off my mind Im so upset
It wasnt your time to beat me there broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me familiys never forgiving me
I know but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner aint quite the future you wanted for me
Was it And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything Ive known owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me didnt graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me so long had this bottled up
Til we meet in person lets keep speaking through my verses for life
This is your song",much harder on you knew you were smarter Not much convo to offer I wasnt much of a talker Great to see you doin better than me even as a father Taking care of yo mama overcoming the drama Your life is wonderful son dont let em take it from you Keep living it to the fullest treasure it its a blessing Be thankful for all this beauty when its over with forget it Damn What up Phil So good to hear from you we missing you freal Remembering all of our conversations daily reminiscing you The hood today they lost can tell they dont know who to listen to Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you I swear its so unfair that Im right here and you up there I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there Now I cant rest and I cant do shit off my mind Im so upset It wasnt your time to beat me there broke my heart to see you dead Shot with bullets that were meant for me familiys never forgiving me I know but all I could do was follow your memory But pops I thank you so much for leaving I had to grow up Slanging crack on the corner aint quite the future you wanted for me Was it And this pain I feel it never goes away Does it This load I carry get no lighter I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home Taught me everything Ive known owe you everything I own I must admit you raised a warrior my life could be a story book Hope you proud of me didnt graduate from college but Thanks for listening to me so long had this bottled up Til we meet in person lets keep speaking through my verses for life This is your song,1 2 3 ooh yea Ooh ohoh I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind That I put down in words how wonderful life is Hey TIP lemme holla at ya Making yo momma proud looking in yo daughters eyes Kickin it with your sons trippin never realize How good you got it been so wrapped up in yo losses You couldnt see the profits could still be in the projects Instead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin So you went back to prison TIP It couldve been a coffin Now since we talkin you been trippin ever since I died Appreciate you missin me but G you still alive Im lookin down at you and sendin smiles to you I checked the wedding out oh tell Tamika hi would you Told you she would get you thats good cuz shawty ride with you Kids getting big seen King riding a bicycle See Niq Niq drive a car see Bubba big as you I see Domani rappin and hes spittin too Little Deyjah beautiful and Major supercool My life is over with dawg your life is good to you And you can tell everybody this is your song And you can tell everybody this is your song I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind That I put down in words how wonderful life is Sit down son And listen to me son and pay attention to me Seems like Im the only one that you would listen to I never knew the time that I aint get to spend with you Would ever result in you making yourself miserable You gotta let it go its painful I already know The past is the past just learn from the grown So you got crystal wit you And your sister Precious too Im proud of you did better than I expected you to Although I knew you was special when you was smaller Thats why I was so

I love my family
The nerve of you
Hell sit and clip at your lines like he aint heard of you
I seen it happen before that man will murder you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
Tiptoein but the whole while cloning
The elephants in the room the bitch glowing
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn in
She walk like its hers but the whole world knowing
Told niggas its the new god flow
Its that New Testament and the old God knows
And you new niggas dont get to pass go
Ill monopolize Boardwalk Empire flow
So dont mention me in the same breath Im Genghis
Just venting I never wished to be famous
Truth told Id much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin niggas to angels
Local niggas hatin but I cant blame em
Clear the road to the riches but I cant pave em
Put Trey up on your hook still couldnt save em
Better chance with a snowball hitting Satan
Dreams money can buy
Three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys

Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
They say its always darkest before the dawn before the dawn 
And that you dont know what you got until its gone until its gone 
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong
And thats why I gots to write this song now cmon now cmon 
Say man I thought it would of been a long time for us time for us 
And many more years on the grind for us grind for us 
I thought the future held a lot for us both and it was brighter
We were super tight but finna be super tighter super tighter 
I guess I just assumed we had more time
For us to make more music music and write more rhymes rhymes 
But never in my life could I ever have seen
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team for real 
You take away the glitter the gold and the gleam
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean
Nothin without the people you love
Say man I miss my brother but I know hes lookin down from above
And theres an angel
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
It all began on Shreveport Ave sittin off in the den
Makin beats and puttin paper to pen
We was determined to win and you couldnt tell us different
Mama West was cool with it but Monroe kept trippin he kept trippin 
It seems just like yesterday sometimes
Sittin in ya bedroom huh writin dumb rhymes man 
You makin beats on the insonic sonic 
And we was smokin dirt weed cause it wasnt no chronic wasnt no chronic

189,"Darkness falls when the cold air hits the ghetto streets
Many are called by few are chosen
Whos to say that when life will deal you the deck of cards
Will you have on your poker face
The hood is desolate
Block dark as its ever been
Young and strong off rock and tying the heroin
And when they fix aint around larceny settles in
Thats when the ground opens up and coffins shuffled in
Aint nobody getting money
They just getting by
Trying to suppress their poverty by getting high
Some search the bottle for what they cant find in God
An empty stomach and a gun equals homicide
Some take the day in stride praying that the night will change
Grandma searching for the answers in her Bible page
Aint nothing worse on a ears than a crying mother
Seeing her baby dying stretched in a ghetto gutter
Murders ruled out they say its self suicide
Smoking dicks drying to drift to the other side
They say hes in a better place where hell feel no pain
Youll soon know the truth when they dig your grave
Out my window I see poverty out my window 
Youth is dying feels like death just follows me
I see poverty
Most folks chase a high to escape reality in this Ghetto just follows me 
In this ghetto oooh whoooa
Whooo
This fucking recession got everybody stuck broke
This shit depressing everybody cutthroat
If you aint spending 45 large on the whole joint
Youre forced to buy 9 hard compressed from a small point
The hood dreary
Neighbours look weary
At the young bucks who just pop pills or smoke airy
Shits scary
To niggas with one package on one corner going to war with one ratchet
The young bucks catch cases
Ramming on their afters
Burn the connect
Let their man jam them for the package
Hustling backwards
All they want is sneaker money
A Breitling and a Grand Marquise
A fresh pair of trees and some Vneck Ts
they done with a gun and squeeze
Til the cops box them in
Caught him with a Glock and ten
Now they on state roll cold locking in
Calling home every chance he get
Talking shit
Making when I get home threats
The block moves on
Young buck the street dont stop
Niggas selling whipped up rock
The fiends wont cop
Try to switch they hustle to weed the tree wont pop
Theres just more of it this shit dont end
I seen niggas lose they life playing dice and skin
Theyll get the same money over
Lose it twice again
Theres a war going on outside nobodys safe from
You either make a way or take one
Yeah I just know what I know
The ghetto
Out my window I see poverty out my window 
Youth is dying feels like death just follows me
I see poverty
Most folks chase a high to escape reality in this ghetto just follows me 
In this ghetto oooh whoooa
Whooo

410,"Uh LA uh huh Chi Town Philadelphia PA
Hey now uh LA yeah Chi Town Philadelphia PA
Listen pick any city the South side the outside
It isnt pretty the tots cryin and shots fired
Protection there be the lopsided cop kind
You see the scene of a crime like every stop sign
My section of twentyone pound is downtown
They walkin round wit the guns out its wild how
The youngings dumb proud followin the crowd now
Leading the blind with they minds up in the Soundcloud
Aint a lotta sunshine when you on a frontline
Listenin to that ghetto drumline duckin onetime
Thinkin how the Devil doesnt tire even sometimes
Wonderin how the fuck could ones rhyme be this unkind
Everybody cold to me seeming through this bullshit
The only thing that sold to me bein told we should hold on
Gettin old to me Im about to buckle
Cause holdin tight got my hands fully whiteknuckled
And to be honest tomorrow is not promised
Whether you on the streets of Chicago or Botswana
You gotta be rock solid not to be outsmarted
The rise from rockbottom to one of the top scholars
I never ask whats the secret of success
With a target on your back and a scarlet on your chest
Listen just get it not a minute to rest
This is not a test settle for the best nothin less dig it
Pick any city the South side the drought side
Where EMS has arrived well its about time
People who just get they tops fried get outlined
Minutes and seconds go clockwise but not mine
Where Im from its a war scene
Where more fiends scream for Morphines Zoloft and Thorazine
We dont subscribe to the grand scheme
The plans seems to be keepin us all sick sellin them vaccines
Aint a lot of fun time when your only son dyin
And the worlds comin untied from the inside
Thats between affection and depression its a thin line
Stress and pressure here is multiplied ten times
Everything is blurred to me lessons deferred for me
Fam said its been a long term since they heard from me
My lil homie never made it out of surgery
Sometimes I feel like South Philly tryna murder me
First everybodys upset cause you died
They like Wait a minute man

Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in
To Las Vegas chaos Casino Oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Let her know Im here if she ever need me to be with her
As long as she know I can never be with her
She asks you why I just need you to keep it G with her
Tell her I found a happiness that I could never see with her
Three years after that break up shouldve had closure by now
Wed be best friends youda let this end wed be closer by now
But you want us upset hostile angry evil jealous bitter shit
Fuck makin your bed and lyin in it
You bought the house live with it
I came to you for a second chance you gave me your ass to kiss
Found another salad to toss how the fuck is you mad at this
Oh I forgot you not in love anymore
And Id believe it but see Im not on drugs anymore
Thats based on action words I stopped believin still I hear it though
Would you save them if you knew they became meaningless to me years ago
But if happiness is the finish line I beat you there
So Karma must be real cause since we broke up he aint treat you fair
And were off to the races places
Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in
To Las Vegas chaos Casino Oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Remember our bad breakup I rapped about it on Downfall
But you know I dont stay down for long
Remember you met that other dude
Whos smarter and more mature with more bread
That you thought would be around for long
Remember you pulled the rug from under me left me to be alone
I threatened suicide begged was crazy about you
But that stalker dude was deranged
To the point you wished death on his name
And when we speak now you still say Im crazy without you
My my how the tables have turned
Or are they bendin just a little You resent it just a little
Cause dude that ruined your life made you doubt yours
Its the reason that loneliness you gave me is now yours
Check it in perspective I cant even call it hatin
You mad at the situation really it aint even Kaylin
We both sympathized that pain is felt and shared
To watch a man that you helped better display it elsewhere
Watch a man you spent years with grew with
Come across as someone that you want nothin to do with
To sleep in a bed with what ifs instead of somethin special
How can you get over us The public wont even let you
I know to wake up with that fear is gross
Love me from far cause you scared to get close
But what are you fearin the most
If happiness is the finish line I beat you there
I always thought that when youd put the baggage down Id meet you there
And were off to the races places
Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in

Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Uh lets bring it up to speed a lil bit
Now a nigga ballin you still tell me to grow some
Entertainin threesomes you dont think that its wholesome
Say that you cant trust me think Im out here trashin you
Got a lot of answers to questions I dont be askin you
I tried to be friends so I dont see a problem passin through
You welcome a nigga then paint it as me harassin you
You must be misconstruin my love and its gassin you
Causin you to wear our shit out and think its fashionable
Im thinkin you should put our history in back of you
That would call for you steppin outside of yourself and bein rational
Come to friendship you question me in that capacity
How would you ever know
Its not somethin you ever asked of me
And VH1 just gave us another episode
So maybe its smart that you cant let this go
Cause love changes a thug changes
And soulmates become strangers word up
And were off to the races places

1139,"Yea
Yea
Rhyme to the rhythm
When I slip in to the zone
And zero deep into the groove
So as to astonish my opponents
When Im on it like I own it
Make the whole galaxy go nuts
Script and held ya deep within a different world
Like Lisa Bonet on DWayne Wayne mane
Never plain stained brains
Strive to elevate from here
Not just to simply maintain
To the bang bang boogie watch my spirit bling bling
I dont need no chains or jewelry
I dont need a dang thing
Hang rappers like a noose
That dont produce another product
Its my souls interpretation
If you want it here I got it
Only so much time allotted
Many thoughts that must be jotted
Clearing out the minds are clotted
Not Im writing on some Pac shit
In the month of August take a break out to the farthest region
On my rocket ship now yall MCs can eat my stardust
See the crew I rep is Quannum
Yall the bench we the starters
We the meal the main course
For your belly yall some toddlers
Keep it modest dope and honest
I dont claim to be the hardest Killer wit a gun I really
Only wanna be a artist
Travel the entire novice global trotter
Got a lot a proper type of sharper riper Ahnken conscious here to offer
In the middle of the sky you see my trail a glimpse just passing
Middle of the night its dusty yet its clear
Like as if you dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some psychedelic clarity to breath within the madness
When youre out and youre far away from home
And your heart and your mind they start to roam
Falling out from the night to spark the zone
Seeing trails from the night that got you stoned
When youre out and youre far away from home
And your heart and your mind they start to roam
Falling out from the night to spark the zone
Seeing trails from the night that got you stoned
Left the planet Earth to get a wider life perspective
On the bigger picture now Im steady cruising through the nebula
Headed out to Mars where souls and minds are more connected
Build with elders how to conquer ignorance
The mighty predator
I be the cosmic editor
And when it rains I let it pour
And if Im short on tour I guess Ill be the lyric peddler
Im deadly with the medley
Steady ready with the metaphor
MCs are RIP if they love life then why they set it for
Headed for your head its gonna erupt Im blowing up
And popping this its court I be the judge and jury
With the Johnny Cochran
Savvy plus I hit the cabby green up really often
When Im rocking like I rock it now stopping is not an option
Powered by a force inside that never will run out of ammo
Used to build with Pharaohs riding through the desert on a camel
Ran into a camel by the name of Joe thought he was wacko
All he did was smile and pose and get my folks hooked on tobacco
I crackle as I rap and pro attack a slacker
Never clever sever heads
Im clever yes Ill never dread a battle
If they white they put their thumbs up a black fist if its a Afro
In the Bay Im hella tight and plus Im filthy in Seattle
In the middle of the sky you see my trail a glimpse just passing
Middle of the night its dusty yet its clear

1094,"That was the best fucking I ever had
Well thats because youve been dealing with the Ace
You gotta leave Where you going sugar
I got business to take care of
Oh shit
Shit thats my old man shit
Better go talk to him
No smoke in the lungs no smoke in the lungs no smoke in the lungs no smoke in the lungs
No smoke in the lungs no smoke in the lungs no smoke in the lungs no smoke in the lungs
Im mind shocking body rocking
Earth shaking money making
Sitting high looking fly
Im drinking on the best wine
Yo bitch I fucked your friend yeah you stink ho
I seen her on the elevator honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega shit bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal I leaned back like Im rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu pockets stacking beaucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoohoo and laughed yo
While I was on tour whore you went to work
Quick fast had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldnt wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where was you at ho Pinky house she put in my perm
Thats all you ever said to me thought that could hold me
Remember when I longdicked you and broke your ovary
You crab bitch chickenhead ho eating Harolds
Im the first nigga that had you watching flicks by De Niro
You gained crazy points baby just being with god
Taught you how to eat the right foods fast and dont eat lard
I gave you Earth lessons I came to you as a blessing
You didnt do the knowledge what the god was manifesting
You sneaky fuck bitch your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleeding held you down in malls
Sexually you worshipped my didick like a cross
I had you freaked out broke out for a month you fell off
You was my main shit my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down the way I thought had you tranqued
But you had to fuck this lobsterhead ass nigga
I shouldve slapped him but the gods said Chill
Thats your wiz fault god handle that in the lab
Im wondering how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low ho catch you next show bro
I got jerked gave away my pussy that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But fuck it I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables had you screaming while you was biting on my cables
We slid to the washing machine and threw it on spin
If your pussy dry spit on my dick and put it in
My dicks the bomb baby marvelous hot steak
Plus Im conceited Starks make the biggest ho call rape
Im God Cipher Divine love my pussy refined
That means clean a FDS smell with a shine
Word up respect that ho

1943,"My world it moves so fast today
The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I cant breathe
And every time Ive tried to be what someone else has thought of me
So caught up I wasnt able to achieve
But deep in my heart the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me
And deep in my heart the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny And deep in my heart

Its that time motherfuckers dub dime motherfuckers
Thats me motherfuckers yeah the champ part 3 motherfuckers
All praises all burners all razors
Hands down nigga the game is all Jadas
Something hot drop I get em in all flavors
Hes a dick you pussy yall neighbors
Yeah two extra whores
Im in the new Aston with two extra doors
With a quick flip I dont try to stretch for more
One hundred percent powder extra raw
And I get it from Giuseppe either him or the eses
Ive been smacking these rappers around for a decade
Still tryin to get mami to sacame la leche
Know if I take her out I could pop her the next day
The Black Mamba of the vocals MJ of the Pro Tools anti social
Phil Jack on the track but I cant coach you
This is just audio of shit that I go through
Guns in the couch money in the mattress
And I would have got the Bentley but I had to pay taxes
Settle for a polo fit and some air maxes
Your flows a light sprain mines is a fracture
Uh but the Xrays negative
You a coward in jail you could never live
Nah You barely living out here
Im the reason you breathing its like im giving out air
I got stocks in the block and im giving out shares
To niggas that dont talk cause they giving out years
I dont know you you aint familiar
And I dont care who shot you cause they aint kill ya
As far as the word play Im a son of a bitch
These niggas is decent but aint none of em Kiss
MTV yall know Ill punish the list
Them niggas jewelry is fake and aint none of em rich
Notice they keep watching em theres no stoppin em
V neck crush linen suede louie moccasins
They wont dry up but you cant buy luck
Cashmere sweats with the gucci tie ups
Overlooking the city my nigga Im high up
And I could get your brains blown out for five bucks
Im always in the hood thats cause I rep that
My paperwork good niggas already checked that
Im probably just comfortable cause thats where I slept at
The desert is blue steel The forty is jet black

2445,"Every soldier got a story to tell
I done been through it all
Dont ask the way I shoot cuz I done shot uggh 
Put a tank on my block
Fiend gone get the scene hot
Greens and rocks
Burnin flesh
Have you ever smelled nigga
Been tapped up ready to die from mail niggas
Straight goin to hell
But livin the dirty dirty
Havin yah mama worry
That  
Tired of being blast at but didnt cast that
I done asked for my life and right there was laughed at
But when I backtracked  
Blast back
Told em to cast that take these rounds and add that
But fact is you dont fuckin choose yo wars
Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns
Check my war wounds uggggh 
My war wounds ugggh 
Every soldier got a story to tell
My adversarys get popped
Got me runnin from cops
The ghettos like Vietnam
Got me carryin two Glocks
My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drivebys and rags
And representin red and blue flags
See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos
Pullin in car dos
And cut up Girbauds
Im down tah blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if Im old G Ill be down to ride and die
If the hood call me
Thats why I be hustin every day
Could you imagine me with no stash
Like a bank with no cash
Tryna drive a car with no gas
And fuck one day with no tag
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
An alright girl with no ass
See Im a Richmond rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans
See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo shit
And the nigga tah be the grave digga
See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been stabbed popped at and shot at
But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I aint forgot that
Its real shits real check my war wounds
This here real life aint no fuckin cartoons
Im the Saudi Arabian death killin veteran of the platoon
Either me or you right here
Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in aint no turnin back
Lay yo ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
Theres no overcome to this shit
Be on yo Ps and Qs nigga
Dont cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga thats a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga thats a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why Im gone
If I die bitch box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the NO with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin sayin fuck Iraq
If you dont believe me check my combat patch
I got a muthafuckin story to tell
Nigga nigga what

One two Big up to my niggas on onedeuce
That cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in blue

Who says I cant burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes

We wasnt sposed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money pussy parties I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin like they know somethin these days
Niggas actin woke but they broke umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin these days
Man they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do who the fuck am I
I heard one of em dissed me Im surprised
I aint trippin listen good to my reply
Come here lil man let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice never quit tourin
Cause thats the way we eat here in this rap game
Im fuckin with your funky lil rap name
I hear your music and I know that raps changed
A bunch of folks would say that thats a bad thing
Cause everythings commercial and its pop now
Trap drums is the shit thats hot now
See Ive been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind that was just a segue
I must say by your songs Im unimpressed hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus you havin fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact
These white kids love that you dont give a fuck
Cause thats exactly whats expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down fuck it I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up you see them turnin up too
You hit the next city collect your money when its due
You gettin that paper swimmin in bitches I dont blame you
You aint thinkin bout the people thats lookin like me and you
True you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that aint true
One day them kids thats listening gon grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your shows lookin light cause they dont show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin and hopin to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped cause you was ridin trends
Now you old news and you goin through regrets
Cause you never bought that house but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends I aint judgin you
Im just tellin you whats probably gon happen when you rappin
Bout the type of shit you rappin bout
Its a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
Im hoping for your sake that you aint dumb as you look
But if its really true what people sayin
And you call yourself playin with my name
Then I really know you fucked trust
Ill be around forever cause my skills is tiptop
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon be on Love HipHop nigga

1317,"Speed of life fast
Its like walking barefoot over broken glass
Its like jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick decisions are made
Lifestyle plush females rush
This high profile personality who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar schoolboys admire
Young girls desire very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme dress code supreme vocabulary obscene
Definition street player you know what I mean
The high rollers x2 
People of the city stop fooling yourself
Crime rules the streets who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash theyll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benzes Ferraris trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to bigtime deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And youre living proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
Youre a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game thats why yall boast
Because youre high priced high speed high post
High roller
Now when I say high rollers I mean the best
Forget the halfsteppers eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of Scarface runnin through their veins
Silk shirts leather suits
Hair always fresh eelskin boots
Large hearts though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruising in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin Pusherman
Yes their fashions high and hard to beat
They buy their Gucci from Guccis not the swap meet
Eat very well much clientele
And whatever you need they probably sell
The high rollers
Oh yes Im here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo or hot as a flame
Theyll shake ya break ya and you wont know their name
Gangsters to the max all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded most men dont understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
Theyre junkies for fun love life on the run
And if things get hot they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame no shame to the game
And they all seek power fuck the fame
The high rollers
Now radio stations probably wont play
This record because of the things I say
Theyll say Im glamorizing the hustling hood
And a record like this can do no good
But Im not here to tell ya right or wrong
I dont know which side of the law you belong
Yes the game has flash but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake hard times lurks
And jails not your only problem though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M16
But to each his own choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit the luxury home
Youll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice
And youre much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right
You wanna be a high roller
You wanna be a high roller
You better watch your back if you wanna be a high roller

587,"Touch It Remix 20 Lyrics
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it start format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it start format it
Oh now you know who the God be
Back runnin the city
And you know who the squad
Flipmode
Look see aint nothin changed
Back with the remix
With the Queens
TURN IT UP 
When you see me in the spot
Better respect each other
Yall already know where Im rep
Aint no reason to check it
And I know that
You aint messing with me
Just for the record
So instead
Imma let Mary J Blige
Come and set it
Get Low Mary 
Maybe you can guess
Who it is
Mary J Blige Im bout to
Handle my biz
Im on my grown woman
Still I rep for the kids
In every hood and all my peoples
Doin a bid
TURN IT UP 
Now you know
Whos really the Queen deliver the mail
Seven Hundred Thirty Thousand
First week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch
Lookin all pale
While Im on a yacht overseas
Doin my nails
Get Low Digga 
Now he sittin there lookin stuck
He thinkin cause he spent
A little dough Im gon fuck
If money aint a thing
Im sayin let a chick know
Type to empty an account
How far you willin to go
TURN IT UP 
Now he hoppin on the jet
He aint wasting no time
Told me all expenses paid
Any place I could find
Hit the islands in the Winter
Trickin all on his dime
Aint no alpha in this world
Who is better than mine
They wanna
Im jinglin baby Go Ahead Mami 
Dont I look charmin
Put your lips up on me
Kiss it touch it good
Yes I wish you would TURN IT UP 
You like to see me
When I dip baby dip
Dont I look like I got Beyonces hips
Lookin like I could be Nia Long
Boy you smokin that
Cheech and Chong
I know what it feels like
I been gone for a minute
But Im back
Chinchilla on with a fitted
Everybody talk money
Everybody gon live it
That bowl of bread smaller
Than the arm
TURN IT UP 
And you know Im doin my thing
Its blue in the ring
If you had it like this
You probably do it the same
But you wont cause you broke
All you do is complain
After the club Imma put a few
In the range and let em
Five boroughs of death
You dont understand
I got New York City
In the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist
And let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world
With a New York Nemesis
TURN IT UP 
I got Staten Island on my pinky
Queens on my thumb dude
The Bronx on my middle
Finger screamin F you
Rock Ice in Manhattan
So theres the ring finger
You know I had to keep
Brooklyn on the trigger finger
Swizz is the monster X is the beast
Fuckin with Bus everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets
Im tired of talkin to yall niggas
Im stickin a fork in yall niggas
TURN IT UP 
When I hit em man
That truck come get em man
Roughed up how I did em man
Aint no remorse for the corpse truth is
Cant ID the body nigga toothless
As I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up wheel up bring it back come rewind
Powerful impact BOOM on the track
Contact Shady Guess whos back
Everybody in the place take a look at the face
I disappeared without a trace hes a little high aint he
New year ooh yeah whos here new gear
Full gear spookier AAH AAH AAH
Im bout to scream at the top of my lungs
And I dont even know why Im screamin AAH AAH AAH

Lets turn it up loud let em know we aint playin
And I dont even know what the chorus is sayin

Just give me the beat Bus with THE BIG BANG

520,"Its Been a Pleasure Album Version Lyrics
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh for the HTown
Tonight Im gon make some money goooo
For the HTowwwwwn
Ladies and gentlemen youre now listenin to the Dirty South trillionaire naire 
Keepin it trill in there been here and hes still in there there 
Pay attention its the beginnin of a new era era 
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer view clearer 
Its like Lasik but are basic
Ebonics if youre hooked on chronic and you can taste it
Trace it recognize the real when ya face it
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted
One shot of Patron then another one to chase it
Put me to the test I wont pass it Ill ace it
Been so many places up and down the interstate
Cities that Ive never been wonderin if they fin to hate
Step up in the spot let em look me in the grill grill 
So they can see it for theyself that
I keep it trill I keep it trill I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip
So its all good good dont even trip
Believe me its been a pleasure
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh for the HTown
Tonight Im gon make some money go
For the HTown
Man Ive been all over the world
Tryin to tell em bout the trill and what we been through through 
What we already done and what we fin do do 
What we got into what we gettin into to 
When ties bout to cut it closer than a ginsu su 
Roll through Atlanta Birmingham Alabama bama 
Jacksonville to Jackson Mississippi spittin grammar spittin grammar 
From Shreveport echo port down to New Orleans leans 
And all points in between just to get the cream cream 
Me and my II Trill team on the road flippin flippin 
Eight hours straight no stops no trippin trippin 
Had to keep them heaters on em so its no slippin slippin 
Promote a play with show money we were slow grippin slow grippin 
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down down 
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town town 
But we always made it home okay
And we still on the road to this day
I gotta say its been a pleasure
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh for the HTown
Tonight Im gon make some money go
For the HTown
They say that you never really know
What you got til its gone and cant touch it touch it 
If it look too good to be true you cant trust it trust it 
If you never had it echo had it then you can never miss it miss it 
But looks can be deceivin so dont you get it twisted twisted 
Walked a lot of miles in these old school Js Js 
Thought of many ways lookin at back in the days days 
Like how to climb from in between a rock and a hard place
How to keep your cool when youre dealin with a hard case with a hard case 
And how to duck when the judge throw the book at you the book at you 
And its a twosided mirror that youre lookin through youre lookin through 
The phone receivers in your hand starin at your child child 
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile smile 
See thats how real life is and how it can be can be 
And how its deeper then just comin down candy candy 
So Im just tryin to play the cards that they hand me
For those that overstood me understand me
Its been a pleasure
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed so tonight we gon do it like this
Ohhhh for the HTown
Tonight Im gon make some money go
For the HTown

Aiyyo who got the drop my gun been cocked
Spits from fourfives to flintlocks pinky finger with the pimp rock
Hustle on dim blocks and sip Hennrock
Draw quick got a second hand like Big Ben clock ya heard 
Reach for that heat put your wig in the wind pop
Fill your belly with ten shots if I get hit
And you see blood then flood the bullet wound with gin shots
Put beef in a Slim Jim box
Bitch you wanna pinch and win slot
Clap lead until your big friend drop
Niggasll front until I send chin shots
Beat the rock until they send cops or what 
Til one of usll get carried out on the thin cot
Emergency room skin chopped by ten docs
Got it locked like a bid in the state pen box
When I dares peers hangin to where my shin stop before I struck rich
Fucked bitches and killed em with a ten inch cock freal 
Bitch nigga stuck him with a ten inch ox yknow 
Bread bloods and stiff vodka deep in this game
Know the feds want the clique locked up
We love brain so we headhunt like witchdoctors

Even the Jake surrounded the spread with pig choppers
That taste preposterous tear gas tanks of oxygen
Like we in banks with hostages what we want 
All we want is minks and ostriches what 
Diamond cuff links and proper shit
Snitches left stinkin in carpet stiff
Or get they carcasses turned to link sausages freal 
Aint nuttin sweet we known for bangin cartridges

My whole life about chrome rims and stone gems what 
Big boned skins Capone brims dick blown in my own Benz
Quick to Scarface thugs who raise up blown brims
Dolla trickin never politickin with grown mens
Ideas of settin me up for loot I wont bend
Just make that light bulb at the top of your dome dim uhhuh 
Who raphappy nigga keep the lyrics and poems grim
Get found at the bottom of the river with stone Timbs word 
Babyface swimmin flash stomach and toned limbs
Wake up every mornin work out in the home gym
Reppin this rap game until my zone ends uhhuh 
Til mixin boards melt down the microphone bend yea 
I spit about street shit but never condone sin
Kept it thug for life baby followed my own trend

2663,"Look my nigga this is dedication this is antihesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy the separation
2Pac of my generation blue pill in the fuckin Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he cant change it
Know he a genius he just cant claim it
Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you cant fade him
How long should I stay dedicated
How long til opportunity meet preparation
I need some real nigga reparations
Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation
Dedication hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice Im done waitin
Im done waitin told you that I wasnt playin
Now you hear what I been sayin
Dedication
Its dedication look
I spent my whole life thinkin out the box
Boxin homies threeonone got DPed but I aint drop
Chirp on me here I come brrt spin around the block
They blurped on me said I ran a stop sign but thats a lie
I spent my whole life starin at the stage
Playin Sega daddy smokin sherm mama playin spades
Catchin vapors grandma said Id get some Jordans for my grades
Thats my baby when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided tryna break it
You take a loss Shit dont cry about it just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback thats my favorite
My nigga L said You do a song with Nip K Dot he a better Crip
I said He a man first you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses
Level four yard livin given to false imprisonment
Listen close my nigga
Its bigger than deuces and fours my nigga
Since elementary we close my nigga yeah straight like that
I give you the game go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin out Grand Ams
Im at the premiere politickin with Top Nip and Snoop
Damn Pac watchin the way we grew from dedication
If it aint congratulate then it look like hate
If it aint congratulate then it look like what Nipsey
Hol up
Look
This aint entertainment its for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I sets not contagious
Lock us behind gates but cant tame us
Used to be Stay safe now its Stay dangerous
Cause aint no point in playin defense nigga
Thats why I dove off the deep end nigga without a life jacket
Couple mil tour the world dawg my life crackin
Cook the books bring it back so its no taxes
Royalties publishing plus I own masters
Ill be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin this out I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin out the eightyfive in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen you got to have it
Dedication hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice Im done waitin
Im done waitin told you that I wasnt playin
Now you hear what I been sayin
Dedication

Stay on your shit and you gon bubble up
We was all poor but we squad so we huddled up
If it aint a bullet or the law it dont trouble us
High doin dirt but Im hopin the Lord cover us
Uptown doin it downtown doin it out of state pursuin it
A cop or a shot from a Glock might ruin it
All I think about is who I drink this King Louis with
My niggas my main squeeze from the jungle
But it seems that money contain Gs
Told the plug make the call whenever the plane leaves
Feel joy from the money whenever the pain leaves
But the pain never goes
Moneys the root of evil am I sane for the flow Insane for the flow
But this the fast life and the lane never slows
Mary Jane for the dome

While I was hittin trees and thinkin of victories
Turned a nick to a dime and bought me a nick of weed
Made me a little rhyme planted a little seed

1386,"You used to be everything now that mean nothing
Thought this was poker with the cards up but we were bluffing
I miss you but pride wont let me tell you
Thought that we had all the time
But Im guessing that plans fell through
Yeah we fell off I wont ask you to climb back
I paid twenty for that Rolly I just want my time back
Was wrong too but I see it now that you dont give a damn
I got you tatted you took off before the ink dried on my hands
I was down to give you the world instead you gave me hell
I lied tried to be perfect and I played myself
And it hurts so bad we coulda worked on that
Cause you say you love me but real love dont work like that
The truth is I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
Said I crack a smile when things get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to dadate you
Rolexs dont ticktock
But damn it baby my time costs
And damn it baby my time is money
So I need payback for all the time lost
I need payback for all the time lost
Said I need payback for all the time lost
Damn it baby my time costs
So I need payback for all the time lost
Say that you love me I say that youre lying
Cause I said we could work on it you said lets leave it behind
Couldnt put together the picture I paint in my mind
So how I see you now insulting me is wasting my time
But we live and learn and learn and love and let go
Cause if we stay in this then we might make it worse than before
Another hard lesson stressing taking personal notes
Remember sweet nothings like baby whats the purpose in those
Both of us saying it shouldnt have went like that
But sometimes in love it just get like that
Used to think that when it went wrong wed get right back
You know Cupids got another arrow and shit like that
And for all of yall watching I hope that this entertain you
And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you
Cause Im still here laughing when it get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to dadate you
Rolexs dont ticktock
But damn it baby my time costs
And damn it baby my time is money
So I need payback for all the time lost

Said I need payback for all the time lost

You know you need it
Can you feel it
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it
Sitting on the corner trying to elevate my mind
I try to rise to seven levels just to drop the nine
Ticktocktick as the clock clicks Im
Tryna figure out how to move you with a rhyme
The hiphop scene is flipping so Im flipping with the scene
I try to write the rhymes so you see it on the screen
And get the verbal picture so I can hit you like a flick
Booming in the jeeps on the wreckshop tip
Hard as any force yet smoothnbutter song
Dont ever try to battle cause youre guaranteed a loss
Im like a hurricane tenacious mundane
A devastating force a threat to the game
I balance the imbalanced and I challenge the unchallenged
Ive never been defeated but the efforts have been gallant
So open up your chakra so I can really rock ya
So when I say I feel it then you got to cause I got ya
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it
Sitting on the park watching brothers play ball
I was in the nothing but the yesyesyall
Never made no money but I had to pay dues
I rock around the block and rock the neighborhood crews
No ganging and no banging and no hanging I refuse
I never sold paper but I spread the news
I never carried guns cause I refuse to lose
I had to choose a weapon so I chose to chew
The microphone the hyper tone is like I own the park
And I can throw a show and flow like Noahs flowing Ark
For forty days and forty nights partied in the dark
While stepping till the AM total mayhem ripped apart
Rumors liven fallacies and rap was just a fad
Unless a form of music use cause that was all we had
But out of the oppression rises yet another leader
And this is just the vehicle to feel it when I feed ya
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it
On the journey the excellent trying to put it in a rhyme
I try to drop the funky lyrics in my travel time
Drop esoteric knowledge with an esoteric sign
Im the Son of Man but who was Mankind
The highest form of natures AfroAsiatic base
So when it comes to music then I got to drop bass
So check the vibe as I rectify
Ill connect advantage and the rhyme that amplifies
Radiates and animates and activates on
Manifesting unquestioned powerful force
Energy is tapered when the vapors are caught
But Ill do battle with myself like a sport
In tune with the universe wicked with the pen
Lyrics got the elements and this is how I win
I flow like water blow like wind
Grow like earth so feel the fire within
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it

1108,"Its effed up when a girl treats you bad
And later on you find out shes doin bad
And deep down inside that makes you feel glad
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Yo met a fly girl by the name of Kay
Baby girl was sharper than a razor blade
Pushed up and I made my way hey 
Hit it off great started dating Kay
Yo she didnt really even make me wait
Put me in a lovely kind of sacred state
Thinkin of a wedding and a cake to bake
Suddenly it started goin wrong
She started coming home more late and late
I was chillin at the bar to make a great escape
Seen her posted up with the homie Blake no way
Furious I started goin ape at Kay
Told me that I just had to take the ache
Left me standin ther with my face disgraced
Took a while to get over the case with Kay
But you know a bro gotta move on on
Months later to the date seen Kay
She had gained a massive ton of weight today
She told me what she did was a great mistake
Loneliness depression was the state she at
Told her Everything would be okay just stay
Positive and things would be okay But hey
Funny as I walked awah away from Kay
Inside my head I heard this little song
It went
Knew a golddigger by the name of Pam
Used to tell me that I was her favorite man
Travel with her everywhere LA to France
Europe and Brazil all the way to Japan
I said its nuttin Im a money makin man
Showered her with gear all of her favorite brands
Took her to the club so she could shake her ass
Suddenly it started goin wrong
Scuffled at the job had to take a stance
Fired on the spot tough break my man
Called up with my problems to relate to Pam
All I heard was click and then a tone
She told me I could go ahead and take my damn
Self and go another place somewhere just scram
It took a while to get over the case with Pam
But I gotta keep pursuin money
Months later and my papers stacked
One day just strollin around the way seen Pam
She looked like she was livin in a paper bag
All alone and pregnant all her days went bad
Goin crazy losin mental space real fast
She pulled a stogie out so she could take a drag
Gave her a dollar as I walked away from Pam
Inside my head I heard the little song

Somebody asked me what my inspiration was when I write rhymes
You know what Im saying I mean it aint no one specific thing
But this is what I told him
I was telling him about the time I was laying in my room you know
Trying to meditate
I got all the lights off Im sitting here with my matches you know what Im saying
I lit a candle closed all the doors the windows cut the lights off
And Im meditating you know Im looking at this candle and this flame
Im fascinated cause the flame was just dancing you know
Its dancing got a mind of its own you know and
This flame controlled everything in the room you know
It was like the darkness paid attention to it you know what Im saying
Its like I wanna be that light
Thats my inspiration
Your thoughts are the flame of a candle flickering in the wind
Beads of sweat like melting wax rolling down the side of your face as you meditate
What are you thinking
See you are the candlestick
Oh how you shine
Rebellious to darkness
Let there be light
Your very existence brings life to the shadows that dance on the walls in my
Mind
Creatures with no faces no expressions no colours no emotions wait
Dimensioning no mind of their own
These are slaves of mimic
See they mimic you
And they are your slaves for as long as you shine
Tears of sorrow signs of grief threaten your very existence
Let your thoughts remain calm
And you will shine forever
Candlesticks echoes
scratches
The situation is this sitting the days of time
In this world full of darkness and crime
Im trying to shine like torches
Help from divine sources
Cats wanna act live but mentally they like corpses
If I could Id resurrect all the dead
Place a tantalum on their heads
No more political divisions we all live
By one universal law the Ten Commandments
Now peep the damage
And understand as its time for repair
But first feast your eyes of the man in the mirror and stare
Feast your eyes of the man in the mirror and stare
Feast your eyes of the man in the mirror and stare

Every hour on the hour motherfucker cant ya tell ya bother me
Im smoking drinking making ma pussy not necessarily yours
So just leave me alone for a minute I finna fuck with a few of these hores
I met this bitch her name was Lucy
Shes a Twitter stalking Facebook groupie
She loves dogs so I nicknamed her Poop
One day she wants me and the next day its Snoop
She keeps posting pics
Cause Lucy she love to stroke them dicks
She got that feel good energy
And a whole lot of nasty memories
I never should have did what I did with the bitch
Cause now I cant get rid of the bitch
Shes throwing up my phone sending texts and emails
All about her dreams of having sex with females
Come swapping in a threesome
But that aint what I want thats what she wants
I keep telling her to leave me alone
Bitch wont stop calling ma phone bitch
Imma stop putting my thing up in ya bitch if ya dont stop calling me
Every hour on the hour motherfucker cant ya tell ya bother me
Im smoking drinking making ma pussy not necessarily yours
So just leave me alone for a minute I finna fuck with a few of these hores

Now I be on some geeky shit
She keep calling and calling
Man that bitch is a stalker
First I want my ass licked then I need my toes licked
Soon as the bitch think she done she done I come up with some more shit
I cant have a square bitch
No I need a rare bitch
No gag reflex no ring no marriage

Im smoking drinking making ma pussy not necessarily yours
So just leave me alone for a minute I finna fuck with a few of these hores
When you looking at her body you gon wanna up get with her because the bitch a banger
Big swag a socialite easily clickin with strangers
Never really know her when you get to meet her cause she was so thick and you thinking she was the bomb first
Ask what she do she say she do promo for concerts
But she dont wanna listen gotta be at every party Im at
Running and rubbing yo buddy all on the rack why you all over a motherfucker like that
All these flaws make a nigga pause with the words
Got the draws but now Im feeling like Im fucking with two other birds
For the urge got a but I cant get out so shoot me
Now the bitch all on the internet stalking me thats what I get for fucking with a groupie
All I could do is smoke a Lucy
Bitch how does she know
But all I know
Betta be the binnest if you fucking with her cause she could be a ho
Nah let me put it in retrospect

Walk up in the thing got my campaign poppin
Champagne poppin bad thang poppin
Headed to the door and aint a damn thing knockin
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin
Campaign poppin champagne poppin
I wrote this on my born day it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat we gon do it gourmet
Im hearing fuckin voices like when porn play
Stay stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine you find a way
Stayed on porches backyards and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper pussy pride and ego
Born to fly call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and EazyE though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was fro
Thats Ice Cold like Dre triple three yo
Pinot noir style better with time
Im gambling with watches getting better with time
So Imma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say time is money forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo get this money put the diamonds on display
Ohh
Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin
Champagne poppin bad thang poppin
Headed to the door and aint a damn thing knockin
Nooo

Bars in alignment stars in alignment
Raw off consignment Gods in the diamonds
Evolve from the science power and refinement
Read between the lines hard to define us
Niggas thats behind us throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
Ive seen Len Bias that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time man precious like diamonds
Look through the glass see what I magnify man
Imma be shining til I die man
Im a rare diamond thats hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an AK
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity aint no disparity
Between peace and prosperity so marry me
Diamonds
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
Im rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say I need that fadeaway
Had a crush on whats her name the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang banging like an 808
Said you cant take his chain away
Real player you cant take this game away
Slang away walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you cant take my dame away
Devil in a red dress but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it daytodaytodaytoday
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court beating all kinds of cases
Weed money pussy liquor thats my favorite compilation
Diamonds

2935,"Renaissance Rap Remix Lyrics
I dont care who first or who last
I just know yall betta rock dis at da drop of a dime baby
Renaissance I dont care what yall say or what yall do
But you got to be finished before the music is through
I dont think they heard me hold up
So here we go now
It be the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles way I displayed
When I used to cool out where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill I would hone my skill
Go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there on Farmers Boulevard I made my mark
Two dudes brothers would dip from us me and NARCS
And then my legend would grow on the Atrain line
Where rappers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me Big Pete Tanya and Sir Ibu
When in the heat of the cypher I was not liable
For all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in your head we gon rock the dead
Night of the living MCs the weak ones fled cmon Bus
Yo yo Godbody wise intelligence
Smack niggas and wrestle with elephants
My beloved respect my benevolence comin like missiles
The issue is this be the shit you cant rebel against
Then I sniff out you niggas that be hidin in bushes waassup
And strangle niggas like poisonous octopuses shut the fuck up
Back with hazardous weathers and blizzards
As I spit stickin out my tongue like an iguana lizard
At you corny niggas ha Animal Planet rap Wildlife
Stabbin you in your back wild nice Ahhhh 
While I hunt and eat you niggas like food leavin you bleedin
Beats Rattle the speakers like some buffalo stampedin
If you dont understand what Im sayin lyrically
Im like goons acciDENTALLY beating you like gorillas playin
Ha ha Bitches know when I spit I be seducin them
Countless money with diamonds thats buried in Jerusalem
The Renaissance
WHOOO thats Busta Rhymes right there
I dont know what I look like sendin Raekwon in there
Where Raekwon at
Ayo squeezing Johnny Walker neck up in the Benzo freezing
The headlong cock block pumpin is easy
Poison medals on my neck wrists and arms
Louie luggages is bronze a big bag of D Happy Kwanz
Together we the ChiLites to twists of the OJays
One line from thisll have you leanin like roach spray
Poison up on Hoyt Street my boys in Mrs our choice
Brooklyn Shaolin wildin in the Royces
Old Gold at the Golden Globes my robe hittin the cement
Chef in the building yep and he been
A thousand one goons at the Rhumba
Certified clients drug money and somethin up giants
Yo its the Tarzan cocaine clan in the area
Guerrillas in Louie hats the more the merrier
Take mines take a hundred 9s
We be runnin out of rhymes never bullets
Try to front and you mines Renaissance


WHOOOOOOOOOOWHEEE 
Ahem I go off
Let me spaz let me spaz Cmon 
Though they call me Weezy F you gon let me pass
So ahead of my time with my nextweek ass
Money on the dinner table like Lets eat cash
And I do it for the killers and the hundred dollar billas
And from now on I dont think you should stunt without a million
Dollars in the bank I got money in the bank
Now throw yo hands in the air if your pussy dont stank
You got a bullet and a shank I got a bullet and a tank
I got fur in my boots and the hoodie on the minks
Stop sweatin me you should follow me Im directing it
Other fools break it down I be dissecting it
Ever since I made it up out of middle America
Everybody wanna be in my genital area
But you better stay away from my chemical barrier
Weezy Baby straight out the Caesarean nigga
Whats it called man Oh yeah Renaissance Rap

Cause yall tear it up when you get it
Lemme see who we had on here

Spit what man

Aint no fuckin rapper man

I dont know Jay
If you dont believe me then
Who you know who can spit till he pop the real
Never thought about rappin till he coped his deal
I really held down my block for real
All I do is crack rock and how to pop the steel
How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools
Deuce 1 ball for Philly like Larry Hughes
Keep the Desert Eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open
Mind went to jail I get dro els roll em
Rookie nigga clipping niggas like L Odom
I got dough I choose not to spend it
Catch me in Avis and Budget in something rented
Long as the windows tinted I dont give a fuck 
Im in it
I was holding with music rolling in the gold Infinite
We keep it raw uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes

We keep it raw uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
Thats just the life we chose
We dont complain thats just how it be
I shuffle back against the ropes like Ali
I hustle through the alley through the Valley of Death
And I never play fair in the eyes of the ref
Fuck it give me a Tech and Ill come back right
Cant throw us out the game you aint got enough strikes
Come at me wrong Ill come at you the same
Come at me sideways Ill come blasting your brains
Come at me indirect and Ill come back wit names
Im hot like boiling water Ill come back wit caine
We keep it raw uncut for all the bitches and hoes
The first time you sniff it it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
I know Im outta control
Me and Jay same track you gotta be kidding
Its like that nigga Jordan Im Scottie Pippen
Its like Magic Worthy Parrish Bird
StocktonMalone shit who gonna stop and hold this
Game like Doc and Moses

We keep it raw uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thas how life goes
Thas just the life we chose
We keep it raw uncut for all the niggas and hoes
And the first time you sniff it it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me
I use to catch that train and snatch that chain uhhuh 
Do anything for a game to catch some change
Whether it was shooting the dice or clapping the gauge
I was a nigga wit a strong arm like Satchel Paige
Im telling you dawg Im the wrong one to fuck wit at all
Im the type thatll set a broad day in the mall
Whether Glocks or body shots you taking a fall
Fuck you cops SWATs Feds and all
No no no homie I didnt say I could hit you wit 30 0s
What I said is I can supply you with 30 of those
Ding ding homie come holla at the kingpin
The Gods are reapal the Carters is lethal
Hang with psychotic people who like so fucked
Niggas came up singing that God was evil
Slang heroin to cats who like revolving the needle
And I blew to the point I bought cars for the PO

Ahem

Young Money Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3 ladies and gentlemen
And you know me

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely Ima die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me Dont get high and I should try to make a living
I tell em Im a hustler and Id rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it if she steal it Ima kill her
I bulletproof the ride now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital Young Money we the illest
And I aint gotta lie when I tell you Im the illest
My flow is nasty like CYphilis
Selfmade G and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap but in the kitchen Im a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Aint got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil intervention
And them birds dont fly without my permission
Im probably in the sky flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean swimming with the pigeons
See my world is different like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble bitch I want the same thing
And you know that Ima ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely Ima die with my finger on the trigger
Dont worry bout mine Ima grind til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high youll see that Im gon be in it
The sky is the limit Errrrrrrr 


Buckten in the coupe and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch Dont talk to me
And if youre talking to them niggas dont talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say Talk is cheap
Cause Im the type that let money talk for me yeah
My flow is art unique yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is Eat
By any means and you just sardines
I got the 40cal tucked in my PRPs
What do you expect Im from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brandnew map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it itll still be ours
And Ima ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely Ima die with my finger on the trigger
Dont worry bout mine Ima grind til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And Ima tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look up high youll see that Im gon be in it
Cause the sky is the limit
And you dont want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or Ill take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone thats sitting
On the living room sofa thats fucked up haha
And you dont want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or Ill take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
Haha now thats fucked up

And you aint got to know the alphabets to see

And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the streets
So you know that Ima ride with my motherfucking niggas

3040,"Ah Redman
Do you feel that the Blacks in your community
Are still mad at the racial situation
Yeah they still mad
And if you dont take that funny smirk off your face
Ima kick your
Over 300 ghettorelated crimes happened in Newark New Jersey alone
Still the saga continues
Stick em up stick em up I got the jammy to your guts punk
Dont make a move before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block cause my stomachs in a knot
And it growls twentyfour hours a day around the ticktock
I got roaches and rats up the back
Carryin bats and gats so I fart fore I snack Jack
Then guzzle it down with water from the hydrant
My moms taking a bath and my brothers next to dive in
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I havent had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squad up cause Ima set up this kid
Carryin loot out from Burger King and what Ima do is
Run up on him snatch the bag of money
Then bust the dummy
Cause my man when I think of a plan theres no shorts take
Cause I pack jammies inside of my North Face
Coat had the Black brother on scope
No jokes what I am cause the mans a pure pro
Yo my man you got a light Straight jackin 
Yeah yeah give me the effin money too G Yo stop stop stop 
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
Cause I was set up now I have to go head up
With the cops but they carryin black Glocks Shits thick 
Whats my next move My lifes on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on once again its on
I fell Ow and then the black Glocks went Pow 
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing Im sniffin is dust because its
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Me and Erick Sermon taking a trip Uptown
In the 4Runner blastin my tape puffin ganja
Since Erick got props
I stepped to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that babycakes was hawkin me
So I kicked it upped the digits terrific
Not knowin she was scopin me cause I was mad splifted
Later on that week honeydip freaked the funk
Playin Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin him weekdays callin me weeknights
Who had her weekends Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
No hats Damn Black The Funkadelic
Took a splash you know how that go fellas
Two months later See you later alligator 
She was pissed and I ended up seein my physician
She took a blood test she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin Why the hell he isnt dead yet
Then I asked her Why you lookin at me
She said Redman because you have the HIV
Called Erick and his set that girl dont mess around
Too late cause Erick already had his drawers down cause its


Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
To all my brothers wear your hats wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters make em wear they prophyllastic
Cause its drastic havin another ghetto bastard
Think Im dying for a piece of butt Honey you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss so pucker up
Cause you end up messin around catchin the heebiejeebies
Lookin like who done it With your face up on the TV
So next time you want sex get wreck but protect
Cause you could be like sexin to your last death
And if you still dont know the time press rewind
Cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline word

In the ghetto the only place a motherfucka will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the Face
Where niggas do they struggle with a straight face
Surviving under conditions demons died in
You could run it but cant hide it so step aside

Cause I love this mothafucka like pussy with no sheets cause its deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and wont surface
They let the money make em nervous whats the purpose
A mothafucka sitting on fat
Who done came up out the hood money cant come back
Fuck that I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me then take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but whats right
Surviving sitting on a ki doing business on a beeper
Im sinking in this mothafucka deeper
Fear the Reaper that no man born of woman harm me
Fuck beat these niggas in your army though Im a killer

3485,"She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle Medelln
In love with her til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon die its startin to be evident
I told her Slow down girl youre heavensent
Im a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them
And I cant let this girl throw her life away
Kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons the girl like night and day
Stressed out parents getting divorced
Girl love em both she aint tryin to sit in court
She a square so its hard to see the angle
And thats why God gave her an guardian angel
Its me and Im here for her swear to God that Im here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She aint had no pride so she went and did a year for him
She a rideordie like Eve and them
Make homecooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side now Im tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her
Takin her son and tryin to be a man to him
She dont wanna pray but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin on the door hounding me
Bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me
When I wake up every day Even though she doubted me
I thank the Lord that we are safe Even though she doubted me
Again yeah Even though she doubted me
Thats why you should pray for me
Thats my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin baby daddy aint takin care of the kids

And at the end He will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed
Yet from this body I will see God
Yes I will see Him for myself
And I long for that moment
Grandma I really miss you and it aint been the same
I drop a tear when I hear your name
Mary Ella Holloway why you gotta be so far away
Used to say Dont worry its gon be okay
But it aint its like when you left you took the Lord with you
Why couldnt I come when He came to get you
Damn I really miss you I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like 10
Crept up in the neighbors yard yeah bein hard headed
You told me I would get it you said it
And boy did I get it but after you spanked me you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead told me that you love me
And I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me
I thought how bad could this hurt be
I know now thats why its only done out of love
What I wouldnt give for one mo hug from grandma
Baby its gon be okay She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay I really miss hearin 
What Im about to say a couple of family members is gon hate me
But Ima let you know whats been goin on lately
Now you know since you left a lot of things with your kids done changed
Yeah Jackies still crazy dont know whats up with James
Aint seen Jerry in a while you know he walk like you
And Renes back in jail you know she talk like you
Riculahs  doing real good now she workin
Rhondas still runnin around trickin jerkin
Buckeyes buggin he done lost his mind
And Jarvis Back out of jail doin fine
Kylie He done changed it aint all about self
As for my father well thats somethin else
But thats my dog he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother makin a lot of trips out of town
But thats a good thing and if I could only hear you sing
Once more oh Lord the comfort it would bring
Baby its gon be okay She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay I really miss hearin 
You left behind a mother eleven kids eleven grandkids
And since then two of your grandkids done had kids
I got a boy named Tacoma Xaviers brother
Thats right Xaviers made you a greatgrandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her acceptin and lovin my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners they were vital
I thank you for my life I thank you for the Bible
I thank you for the songs that youd sing in the mornin
Amazing Grace while Im yawnin
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life like everything comes to an end
I pray I go to Heaven to see you again Amen
Baby its gon be okay She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay She used to tell me that

Cant wait to buck a hunnid shots at the enemies ayy
Its like that
Shouldnt listen to the Ghost if you was never insane
Never the same once you learn to weather the pain
May you be never indicted never arraigned
Cant appreciate the sun if it never would rain
Respected by the Crips and the Bloods with the old flags
Ridin dirty ratchet on her but no tags
Keep your foot on the gas or you gettin a toe tag
Get a hole in your mask you aint able to draw fast
Ask God for a autograph knowin he draw fast
But how Im gon get it when Im on the warpath
I would battle the sun and the moon for more cash
I could humble myself if Im on the Lords path
Ima schizo maybe Im a psycho
Disciple of the night and all that is trifle
Exdope boy did all that was trifle
Im about peace but still got my rifle
Im about peace but Im with these hunnid shots buckin at my enemies runnin up the street
Im about war but Im with my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat
Im about peace but Im with these hunnid shots buckin at my enemies runnin up the streets
Im about war but Im bout my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat
Thinkin to myself I shoulda took my time
Left the dope game for rap shoulda took my lines
Get the city on my back never took my spine

302,"Niggas is flossing a lot time to start extorting the block
Just a portion of the prod off the top for my Porsche and my yacht
Something for the cops to keep em blind so we can grind
With peace of mind turn the key and shine without being dimed
Time to expand New York to Chicago Colorado
You know my motto Clock Gs and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Prignon
Were buying out the bar and Don Juan
And every womans Chandonin
Long donging em down like Sean Michaels does em
Im like a psycho fucking sucking the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister
Cmon on sister Big Puns Mr Cock and Squeeze like a gun tester
Crushing sisters backs with the demon snap hit you from the back
Close your eyes relax let me feed the cat
Living fat true mack niggas was catching feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck just wasnt as mass appealing
I started feeling funny niggas coming short with money
I called my son he told me chill hed be over in twenty
Punny whats the deal Niggas wanna kill me
He said its real they jealous and tired of seeing me Willie silly
Had more to claim niggas throwing shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches running the train
Its like a dream I called my team and started flipping
Locked the clip in started lifting
Niggas off the ground like a magician
I skipped town be back around when things quiet down
I lost it all for now but itll take more to hold me down
Top of the world ma Ha ha top of the world 
Yo this is the bad time boomerang bring it all back
Flashback live and prosper eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula popular to the masses
I miss the EClasses rocking game with death glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis
Boomerang plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shining like sterling then you broke like brick in Berlin
Now should I slit my wrists Go for it all or call it quits
Picture me taking my life leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record and respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedies above the law
Fuck em all
Im coming for the rich thieving em even if I wasnt poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and be the primary source
Of course I bury any adversary trying to floss
Just because the reason I leave em lost in the sauce
Teeing off like we up North just for being soft
A beaten horse like a slave getting minimum wage
Feeling the gauge front page these are the last days
Cash pays and rules the root of all evil
Shooting amigos for loot and perico polluting our people
Moving kilos like its all good through every ghetto
I aint judging but bugging how we fall so many levels
The devils got us by the balls
Thats why the law allows the drugs to overflood
Knowing we gonna buy it all
Its time to call a world order where every girls your daughter
And priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
Im gonna get mine either from crime or through the Bible
Whichever way it better pay Im feeling suicidal
Yo this is the bad time boomerang bring it all back
Flashback live and prosper eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula popular to the masses

Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis

489,"Dark places I would play

Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find

Theres no suicide like the lie that you tell yourself and believe it
Mask look decent face is weeping underneath it
Selfhate feasting on our deepest darkest secrets
Warning signs that read help needed too ashamed to seek it
Seems so easily deleted when youre browsing
But cant erase the history of what your eyes allowed in
The intimately profound ecstasy that gives lifes
Stripped of all its meaning til it eats you from the inside
The big lie you just do this to get you through the slim times
One click at a time til you prefer the counterfeit kind
Seen so many scenes that it would seem youre desensitized
Just to get your fix you begin dipping into the sick side
Seeking to feed a demon that you no longer recognize
If you swear it off youll never find a place you can hide
Inside your pocket lies a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple
Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didnt last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying keep the fire burning no not dying
Dont get it twisted
Theres no innocence existing in its biggest business
You create specific demand whenever you click it
Whatever it is youre into someones got to fill it
Have their lowest moments frozen to be shown infinite
You watch the porn get savager
Box office movies nastier the TV gettin trashier
School girls are flashing the camera
Profile pic look just like the next amateur
Babies get exposed no ones controlling how it damage them
You find yourself detaching retreating reacting
Deep anger decreased passion and you keep lashing out
Your sweet family reminds you of your weak habits
You have no mercy for yourself and so youre relapsing
Your sweet attraction used to drive you to that deep connection
Youre feeling so cold and lonely when you least expect it
Atop your desk sits a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple
Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didnt last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying I keep the fire burning 
No not dying Im trying to keep it 
Now that I have died I have no taste for life
Or the affairs of the living
Only for love and the affair of the lovers
The affairs of the living are many and assorted
The affair of the lovers is singular and complete
Do not mourn this walking carcass
Some are dead because they are without life
Others are dead because they are beyond life
Yet others have forgotten the affair of life and death altogether

Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven Im taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me Im a sensei

Shes out of your possession you cannot protect her then
South Central thats my residence
Deadly like them seven sins
And if Im not the king of this
I must be the president
OMG Im ill as shit money is my medicine
Shout out to my niggas in the pen text messaging

Conjugal visits make sex seem so irrelevant

Im a bad bitch Im a cunt
And Ill kick that ho punt
Forced trauma blunt
You play the back bitch Im in the front
You need a job this aint cuttin it
Nicki Minaj is who you aint fuckin with
You lil Fraggle Rock beat you with a padalock
I am a movie camera block
You outta work I know its tough
But enough is enough
Rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon
I aint into SM but my whips off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twistedass mind got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head fuckin pencil for a frame
You dont like it then peel off bitch
Every last woman on Earth Ill kill off
And I still wouldnt fuck you slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God Ill piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning spin and wheel off
Snap the axle in half bust the tierod
Quit hollering Why God
He aint got shit to do with it
Bygonesll never be bygones
The world aint finished swallowing my wad
I aint finished blowing it nice bra
Hope itll fit a tough titty bitch lifes hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin face and called me a fuckin tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is lifes treating you like dry sod
Kick it back in its face my God
Its Shady and Nicki Minaj you might find the sight quite odd
But dont ask why bitch ask why not
The worldworld is my punching bag and
If Im garbage youre a bunch of maggots
Make that face go on scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a rah rah like a dungeon dragon
You fell off off they mustve bumped your wagon
You mustve went off the back Im bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane you just jumped in traffic


Is this the thanks that I get for puttin you bitches on
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone
Shouldve sent a thankyou note you little ho
Now Ima wrap your coffin with a bow
Nicki shes just mad cause you took the spot
Word that bitch mad cause I took the spot
Well bitch if you aint shittin then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn thatll off your top
I hear the mumblin I hear the cacklin
I got em scared shook panickin
Overseas church Vatican
You at a standstill mannequin
You wanna sleep on me Overnight
Im the motherfuckin boss overwrite
And when I pull up vroom motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin buck overbite
I see them dustyass Filas Levis
Raggedy Anns holes in your kneehighs
I call the play now do you see why
These bitches callin me Manning Eli
Manning Eli these bitches callin me Manning Eli
All you lil faggots can suck it
No homo but Ima stick it to em like refrigerator magnets
And Im crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah look whos back again bitch keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have yeah right
Still hungry my ass you assdicks had gastric bypass
Aint hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin balcony
Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is so why ask
When Shady and Nickis worlds clash
Its high class meets white trash
Rah rah like a dungeon dragon

1084,"Yeah whats the deal Whats the deal yall
I need yall niggas to buckle up one time
Fasten your seatbelts Ima take yall on some real shit
This Theodore shit yall niggas know what time it is and shit
Yknow I mean Its real motherfuckin shit you know
Yo making moves back and forth uptown
60 dollars plus toll is the cab fee
Wintertime bubble goose goose clouds of smoke
Music blastin and the Arab V blunted
Whip smelling like fish from 125th
Throwin ketchup on my fries hitting baseball spliffs
Back seat with my leg all stiff
Push the fuckin seat up tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks
Rocks is lit while Im poppin the clips
Im ready for war got to call the Cuban guys
Got the Montana booth in front of the store
Made my usual gun check safety off come on Frank
The moment is here take your fuckin hood off
And tell the driver to stay put
Fuck them niggas on the block they shook most of them wont look
They frontin they no crooks they fuck up they own jux
Look out for Jackson 50 cause they on foot
Straight ahead is the doorway see that lady with the shopping cart
She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway
Damn she look pretty old Ghost
She work for Kevin she bout 77
She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses wedding
Flew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in
3 oclock watch the kids third floor last door
You look paranoid thats why I cant juks with you
Why Why you behind me leery
Shakey Dog stutterin when you got the bigger cooker on you
You is a crazy motherfucker small Hoodie dude
Hilarious move you on some Curly Moe Larry shit
Straight parry shit Krispy Kreme
Cocaine dead bodies jail time you goin carry it
Matter of fact all the cash Ima carry it
Stash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott
This is the spot yo son your burner cocked
These fuckin maricons on the couch watchin Sanford and Son
Passin they rum fried plantains and rice big round onions on a Tbone steak
My stomach growling yo I want some
Hold on somebodys comin get behind me knock at the door
Act like you stickin me up put the joint to my face
Push me in quickly when the bitch open up
Remember you dont know me blast him if he reach for his gun
Yo who goes there Tony Tony one second homie
No matter rain sleet or snow you know you supposed to phone me
Off came the latch Frank pushed me into the door
The door flew open dude had his mouth open
Frozen stood still with his heat bulgin
Told him Freeze lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment
Frank snatched his gat slapped him asked him
Wheres the cash coke and the crack Get to smokin you fast
His wife stood up speakin in Spanish big tittie bitch holdin the cannon
Ran in the kitchen threw a shot
The kick in the fourfifth broke a bone in her wrist
And she dropped the heat Give up the coke but the bitch wouldnt listen
Im on the floor like Holy shit watchin my man Frank get busy
He zoned out finished off my mans wiz
He let the pitbull out big head Bruno with the little sharks teeth chargin
Foamin out the mouth Im scared
Frank screamin blowin shots in the air
Missin his target off the Frigidare it grazed my ear
Killed that bullshit pit ran to the bathroom butt first
Frank put two holes in the doormans Sassoon
The cokes in the vacuum got to the bathroom faced his bad wounds
The big one had the centipede stab wound
Frank shot the skinny dude laid him out
The bigger dude popped Frankie boy played him out

3572,"Hope Ft Faith Evans Lyrics
I wish the way I was living could stop serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when Im on the block And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I wont have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail And I
Wish that my grandmother wasnt sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick And I I wish 
Wish my homies wouldnt have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song And I I wish 
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi And I
Wish My hommie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride And I I wish 
Wish that God could protect us from the wrong
So all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
We would never break
Though they devastate
We shall motivate
And we gotta pray all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better so you aint gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer get ya money man life goes on
Lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful Hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay
Cause we hopeful
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up I wish 
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have em trippin of the joy I bring
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man And I I wish 
Wish the families that lack but got love get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lac thats on dubs And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder you feel me  I wish 
And I hope all the kids eat
And dont nobody in my family see six feet ya dig 
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone And I I wish 
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R Kelly And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again I wish 
That one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish we could never get the blues
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2 I wish 
I wish that we could walk a path stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay
Cause we hopeful
Wish the earth wasnt so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic
If you dont listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldnt have to go to war
Why cant we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr King Why cant we all just get along
Hope we can find a better way to shop and please And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if its you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church
And lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away let it take you away 
And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay i know it aint easy 
Cause we hopeful
",And I hope all the kids eat And dont nobody in my family see six feet ya dig I hope them mothers stand strong You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone And I I wish Wish I could give every celly some commissary And the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R Kelly And I Wish that DOC could scream again And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again I wish That one day they could speak again I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN I wish we could never get the blues Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2 I wish I wish that we could walk a path stay doin the right thing Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game Lets HOPE Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it Let it take you away And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way I know it aint easy but thats okay Cause we hopeful Wish the earth wasnt so apocalyptic I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it We can make it always be optimistic If you dont listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it I pray for justice when we go to court Wish it was all good so the country wouldnt have to go to war Why cant we kick it and just get em on And in the famous words of Mr King Why cant we all just get along Hope we can find a better way to shop and please And I Hope we find a better way to cop a keys And I Wish everybody would just stop and freeze And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies You can be wrong if its you doubting With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church And lets HOPE Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it Let it take you away let it take you away And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way I know it aint easy but thats okay i know it aint easy Cause we hopeful,Hope Ft Faith Evans Lyrics I wish the way I was living could stop serving rocks Knowing the cops is hot when Im on the block And I Wish my brother woulda made bail So I wont have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail And I Wish that my grandmother wasnt sick Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick And I I wish Wish my homies wouldnt have to suffer When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother And I Wish I could go deep in the zone And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song And I I wish Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi And I Wish My hommie Butch was still alive And on the day of his death we had never took that ride And I I wish Wish that God could protect us from the wrong So all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home We would never break Though they devastate We shall motivate And we gotta pray all we got is faith Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day The Lord is gonna help you feel better so you aint gotta cry today Sit at the light so long And then we gotta move straight forward cuz we fight so strong So when right go wrong Just say a little prayer get ya money man life goes on Lets HOPE Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it Let it take you away And be hopeful Hopeful and hell make a way I know it aint easy but thats okay Cause we hopeful I wish that you could show some love Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up I wish I wish I could teach the world to sing Watch the music and have em trippin of the joy I bring I wish that we could hold hands Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man And I I wish Wish the families that lack but got love get some stacks Brand new shack and a lac thats on dubs And I Wish we could keep achieving wonders See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder you feel me I wish

I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
I just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
She wasnt causin it
She must be stupid as a fiend
They should have told the child You dont step to the Queen
Perplexed and Im vexed cause everywhere I go
People be flexin expectin me to wanna flow
I dont play that the only way that
I would be playing is if I pay back
And run the playback so whatcha sayin
You dont wanna be a sista in the name of rap
And yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
But now Im fed so its off with your head
Now
The moral of the verse is your career is through
And dont be fuckin with nobody who aint fuckin with you
If I was in yo shoes Id let the BS start walkin
Next time there might not be no talkin
I cant understand I cant understand

A brotha pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
He was on a quest and I was who he was seekin
And although I am Black and he was a Puerto Rican
Aint make no diff to me so we continued to speak and
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll
Before I knew it I fell in love with his soul
Aye papi Aye Was the cry as he made love to me
I was freaked by the way he used to do me
And then one day when I was washin our clothes
A number fell outta his pocket and her name was Rose
A girls number Hmmm That struck me kinda funny
I lost my grip I had to call up the honey
There was a chick on the side Oh no it couldnt be
There was a chick on the side Hes down with OPP
I gave you the whole shabang
Just to find another woman hittin my thang

Why the negative vibes And why do people take bribes
I dont understand it yo I dont know 
Why do bad people live And why do good people die
Somebody gotta tell me why  I dont know 
Why do people smoke crack And why do White fight Black
Whats that scenario  I dont know 
Why do hearts get broken Why the chumps get choked
They know I aint no joke  I dont know 
Now with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn
Its a crazy ass life and thats my word its bond
Im tryin to be as logical as I possibly can
But for the life of me you know I just cant understand
Whats goin on sometimes
So situations like this come out in my rhymes
But Queen Latifah aint gone just yet

202,"Here comes the conquering brother that varies and never ceases
Violators pick up the pieces Uh 
That are left behind as youre left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine
Grippin on a microphone recitin a poem
Givin competition a Big Daddy syndrome
Some step up Hmm none kept up Mmm 
They rap a brief moment and then shut up
Lips are sealed because all of this is real
Im not about frontin I tell the real deal of society What 
So how we livin
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Givens
Not to offend I just want you to comprehend
Every message I send Tell em 
Cause I dont understand I have to wonder damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother get paid undercover
Sellin drugs to one another
Cause all the glamour you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um um lets say um poison
Destruction to all your own boys and
Girls who like to buy and give it a try admire
They cant deny the high thats why they soon die
These are games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay
No sign of brotherly love
Just scavengers in search of

When Im cruisin in my Volvo cops harass me
They never ride past me they hound me like Lassie
Wantin to give me a summons or a ticket
Huh I got a place for them to stick it Kick it 
They cant understand to see a black man
Drivin a car that costs twentyfive grand
The first thing they say is Whered you steal her
And then they assume that Im a drug dealer
Huh that just makes me wanna laugh
Cause no Im a star and your son got my autograph
So all the cops on the highway gettin me
My name aint Keith so could you please stop sweatin me
So I can flow on and go on so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on
Reachin the summit as you learn from it
A lesson taught from yours truly so here cometh
The royal majesty others have to be
Fully prepared though they still wont last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
Ill show the meaning of power and just cancel Period 
Out of order conquer and slaughter
Youre comin up shorter boy youll need more to
Compete cause the heat is deep in concrete
To beat bring a complete fleet when we meet
Or stay away put new rhymes on layaway
Then come get this when youre ready for business
Cause aw yeah Im with this Im ready 
Yo Mister Cee what is this

MCs and enemies I freeze at thirtytwo degrees
Because they dont drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day I heard a brother say
Taxi cabs dont even come my way
They all be afraid they wont get paid
So they zoom right past to pick up a lighter shade
And if they stop the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money upfront
Treatin me like Im some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they dont wanna get mugged
Whos in the right or wrong Its time to unite along
And righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like Kid n Play 
Hey even my man LL Cool J
Stetsasonic and EPMD
Public Enemy and BDP 
SaltNPepa cause we cant sever never
Whether whatever we better stand together
That means unite not fightin or fussin or cussin
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin

Yo yo now on some battlin shit my verbal lateral grip
Keeps my tongue glued to the ADAT when Im trackin my shit
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
And make you rappers have fits cause Im back in the mix
Fuck a pad and a pen write rhymes on a IBM
Ebonics is dead the binary language is in
Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit
Meditatin on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reigns sovereign with a deeper conscience
Than the prophet Muhammad was born with
My brain cavity is enormous
My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark that niggas get lost in
The type of dark you fear when you dead in the coffin
I hear you talkin but I ignore it
Cause its garbage and your rhymes boring
So keep standin on the corner
The trash manll collect you in the morning
Thug cats frontin wacker than Blinky Blink
On the back of the Raptor Wagon babblin about nothin
Fuck that real Rugrats can get it on black
Meet me at The Tunnel where pussy niggas get mugged at
So dark youll never see the blood splat
And you cant even react
Cause the trunk is where you keep the guns at
Now you on speed cause you too scared to come back
You cant even breathe the weed suffocates your lung sacs
Fake MCs haul ass like they runnin track
Where ever Canibus or Rakim is at what the fuck

Heart snatched through your chest cardiac arrest
Crack your neck while I break your arms catch your breath
Then I ask the ref How many cats is left
Oneonone who challengin Come get did
All I have is a pen and punishin kids
Abdomen punctured in look what I done to his wig
Wanna live Then I stab em in the lung with his rib
Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine
Rematch wherever we meet at any place any time
Get your snotbox smashed with a nine smacked with a rhyme
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain what its like seein your brain
You insane whos gonna ID the remains
And then I reincarnate em and kill em again
Again and again again and again cmon

The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful
And chopped him in the Adams apple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
So Imma twist em up like a pretzel then Imma tag you
Im on some Stone Cold shit warn your whole clique
Cartilage get torn until the whole bone split
Who wanna spit Bang em quick strangle em wit his lip
Try to flip leave his body danglin by his hip
Ra you left him danglin I cant believe he tryna grapple again
I swing him around like Im dancin with him
Put his arms in back of his head and snapped him again
Fractured his limbs and put him in the figure 6 subtracted from 10
Seven birds make em swerve til they vision is blurred
Turn cats that souped from superb to nerds
Just say the word Ill leave your DNA on the curb
And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard

Yo yo guzzlin forties Lets get it on fella no doubt
The Wallabee champ comes back
Iron Man strikes back Lou Diamonds Tony Starks 
Raid your whole empire no doubt
Rich man poor man read the headlines
Niggas gettin murdered for spots and bigger dimes
Droughts and drug wars living by gun law
Jail cats come home and want to take yours
As a young one growin up broke me and my peoples
Had to sell coke I guess we all in the same boat
Thinkin plus drinkin that ninetyproof
Layin on the roof sayin We need a next man to shoot
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child Yo 
I know a rich kid who got hit for three bricks
Showin off his 850 plush what a nice whip
Young blood guzzlin forties hustled in the rain
Old Earth shootin dope in her veins
He never had it all the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song I Miss You written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original neighborhood criminals
Clockin dollars by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers he rolled around with the
Wildinest niggas peelin caps known as the Islanders
From Staten where crazy clips be clappin
Slept in expensive gold spreads threads made of satin
Labeled as the cow he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks he pulled out on Duke Hez and Latief
But he fucked up he shoulda kept it real and went for kill
Cause if he dont these niggas with black barrels will
But shit never calmed down one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square relaxed like he lived in there
Two kids was beamin him them niggas from the movie theatre
One had all Guess on lookin like he had a vest on
The other Pelle Pelle tucked with a firearm
Movin slow baseball hats crazy down low
Word life God this bookhead nigga gotta go
Oh shit bookhead just bought a five G head
A King Tut piece about the size of Little Maurice
We got to get him baby yo cousin count to ten
Im runnin in my first instincts is theyre returnin
The time is now walked in and pulled out
Remember me the nigga from the UA and you pulled out
Dont move dont even flinch fix em up
Drop the head dont want to get blood on the Tut
He burped I shot him bitch screamed out Im robbin him
Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor shake the comedy
Granny came out blacked down with a half a shotty
I laughed grab the King Tut head and the cash
Granny shot my man in his ass and broke mega glass
Damn had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee fast
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child Oh shit what the fuck Shit was horrible 
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child

As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight
Its only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until its too late
Just so you remember who you dealing with
The number dont change I know who the chemist is
Brick by brick we kept open dealerships
Mitch by mitch we built up our villages
Seein you rappers apply for the stimulus
Livin a lie but die for your images
Its guns involved like cowboys and Indians
You Trackhawk niggas are not my equivalent
Flew your bitch to Cuba for the thrill of it
But I aint go to show you what you shoulda did
Tennis chains to hide all my blemishes
My Jokr smile you know who the villain is Hahahahaha 
Just so you remmber who you dealin with
Look outside the landscape ridiculous
Motion lights surrounded meticulous
Architectural Digest my premises
She just spent a million on the finishes
Millionaires were made out of middlemen
That hole in the attic was not for a ceiling fan
Army Celine the wardrobe is militant
And army fatigue when I talk pyramids
Just so you remember who you dealin with
The purest snow we sellin white privilege
Designer drugs will turn niggas limitless
Designer clothes these hoes losing innocence
The book of blow just know Im the Genesis
As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight
Its only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until its too late
Just so you remember who you dealin with
This Pyrex talks but Im the ventriloquist
Language different Im damn near an immigrant
A song with any of you niggas Im disinterested
The needle is sharp but they aint shootin insulin
You missing the point these drums aint Timbalands
Never thought wed go to war
After all the things we saw
Its April Fools Day
Tomorrow never comes until its too late
We fight for the bill you niggas still chipping in
You Google to death the shit I get driven in
My boys in the hood is mixed with the menaces
The cane is sugar and cut by Dominicans
Open the box its like ten Christmases
My folks in the box is serving life sentences
I live in a world that never leaves witnesses
Just so you remember who you dealin with

1140,"The sun dont shine
With rhythm and enhance and every day
I come throw rhymes
And leave ya lifted up into the sky like humble kind
And show you how a true lyricist does it one more time
With the gung ho fun flow what do you know
Uh oh prime time in the jungle
Rhyme flyin into one soul
High tide better run for it
Night light in a rumble
Right right left and a uppercut cold
Clockin em rockin em stoppin em in their tracks
One flow after the next
Im holda grudge over
When I grabbed the mic and ripped it
And I left a smudge over your career
Today Im quiet
Because I am much older
Not the type to kill a rapper that would
Cry on your shoulder
Live from the solar system
Jehova made over
Play it over and over again
And it will never fade away stay sober
Color outta the lines like Crayola
Only way youre ever outranking my skill is payola
Its the naplam bomb droppin and stay calm
Im poppin and ray 
Innovate cum laude
Choppin it Bay down to H town
To way down south
Rockin it way down to a town
Like hey now now
Quannum and they drown sounds
Will never fade out bounce
Or far and way out mountains
How I lay out styles
Its how I make loud doubters
Into straight out followers
Dont ever play round
I may pound ya stay down clowns
Is there a three ring circus in town
Ive heard it performing on the underground circuit
Around here somewhere somehow
Better stay with that sound out of earshot rounds
Cause me and Gab will pound
That bullshit into submission truth be told
I dont wanna give the false impression
That you could stand around smilin
If you cant stay down silent
Fight for your options
We dont play around drownin fools
Surround your crown and
Overwhelms your sensibilities
Turns you out
Unless you got a natural predisposition to divinity
It might be difficult to listen to it
Let alone mimick me
Its alright I dont charge much for my tendency
If you let them set up a tent in your cd changer
Stranger things have happening
One of them involved me stopping rappening
One of the reasons rappers are in danger of
The thing is that the manglers of the microphones
Will strangle you with the slang
The g will pain and take your soldiers
Jostle slingin things remain
Pen and pad
Annihilator violator
Higher state Im wide awake
And rhyming vital tidal wave
Into this recital
Play the mic all day
Microwave
Mental frequencies
As we take over your mind and make

2929,"Uh
Abstract Queens cat what we lookin at
Sixth sense too immense smellin is the fact
Out here you got your shiesty cats stabbin back for some track
Until we take it back you probly wont be feelin rap
Wordsworth Brooklynite what it lookin like
5 senses 9 inches 5 foot in height
Out here you got ya crooks and heists shook and shiest look alike
Payed off the books from dice good lookin and hookin tight
Us you they and them
Yo Her and him
We make it blend I say we makin it blend
Yo Uhuhuhuhuhuh
Cmon
Back when I came out first joint I hit it out
New styles to talk bout new ground to walk about
Still breakin shit wit the hammer of Thor god
Bigger than Asgard hittin ya ass hard
Act it out cause theres no time to word shit
You never win wit Wordsworth the wordsmith
The verse gets tighter every second the earth twists
Heard its QTip and Words you had to purchase
Prefer this now wait a minute whats that I heard skip
Nerves twitch played this so much its probably your third disc
On purpose at your service basement to surface
Learn this how can you rehearse somethin thats perfect
Isnt it funny when you use your favorite pen
And get your rhyme pad write shit thats truly bad
Embarrass yourself make a fuckin mockery
End the hypocrisy you never toppin me
Im the monopoly in jail is your cacophonies of unfair policies
In there youre rottin B
You hit the lottery well then you spottin me
Im extortin you of all your natural bodilies


Ayo it gotta be the way I respond that makes you honor me
Song hittin award winnin yall just the nominees
Play it safe Ill arrange your wake
My paper mate will have my label mates album released a later date
Police patrol the city til Im as old as 50
Hat back clothes wont fit me causin 50 to frisk me
My hands are ammunition banned like contraband in prison
Im who you wanna be blowin out your candles wishin
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Make makin it blend
Yo I like a woman wit a bangin body the face and frame of Halle
Attitude angry snotty
Speaks slang and cocky
Time to hang Aint gotta bring a posse
Through rainy days she got me like Whitney stay wit Bobby
Yo your cake is in the kitchen your wishful premonition
Is turned around by my firm thoughts of demolition
Its time to numb your run and dim your vision
Its time to give up the hopes and dreams of major acquisition
Aint got a droptop that goes 0 to 60
But after shows ladies drop tops and show they titties
Across the globe you cant oppose its risky
Or even go against me
Im Words so every time that you flow you spit me
We in the asphalt you cause your last fall
Insult to injury is when we curse the salt
Douse the open wound to the tomb
Its time to sit back and watch professionals in full bloom
Us you they and them
Yo Her and him

2057,"Nothin can save ya
Nothin can save ya
Nothin can save ya
Just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
Keep em there yo run the jewels run the jewels run the jewels
Can you feel it
I used to be rollin like a millionaire
Cash in a flash bankroll to spare
Homeboys hangin champagne and girls
Give my main woman diamonds my mistress pearls
Everybody laughin at my corny jokes
I was stupid I thought that they were sincere folks
It turned out they liked the money and the fame
If I aint get paid Id be that nobody James
The nobody who dreamed about bein somebody
Chief rocker at the party
And they was hangin like Yo Im your man
I dont even care about the ring on your hand
Wed go out to eat and chill
But they would go to the bathroom when it was time to pay the bill
I didnt notice all the chuckles and laughter
Too busy with a female tellin me Im the master
I was slick like Huh do I know you
I got play here let me show ya
Used to have a girl that was on the ball
When the cash flow got low so did her calls
Used to have a homeboy always chillin
My cash went low he told me I was illin
And dont call cause he dont hang with derelicts
Broke with no cash yo I was in the mix
Everybody stepped cause my pockets wasnt fat
My girl got a new man I fixed his flat
Im the one that theyre laughin at
They say Cheesy rat you aint all that
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it Im starvin you know what Im sayin 
Can you feel it Nothin can save ya
I mean crabbin
Played out by backstabbin I feel like tyin
A anchor to my ankle and jumpin right dead in the ocean
Cause Im ashy and I cant afford lotion
Socalled friends in the jewelry store
Told me Todd come back when you get off tour
Souped as hell I really regret it
Now the only thing I got in my pocket is bad credit
How can a man like me
Be walkin around in a world of misery
And if women like a man with a body its not mine
Cause they be walkin past me like Im a stop sign
My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty
Sayin Todd it seems you used to have a sporty
The Benz was slammin the Jeep was pumpin
Aint that somethin
I just laugh and say So what I was rich
But when I walk away its like aint this a
Kick in the rear that Im standin here
And cant afford a tissue for my tear
Should I drink wine and brandy
Or get a job puttin stripes on candy
Or put a hole in donuts
Cause when youre broke your middle name is So What
I had to learn in an incredibly fast way
When you aint got no money they treat you like a ashtray
I pawned all my jewelry and clothes
Right after that I got dissed by all my hoes
That I thought was mine but really never was
Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz
That my tank was on E and that means empty
That Twinkie looks good so mister dont tempt me
Everybody thought I was trippin
I rode the back of the bus but my grip kept on slippin
Im the man that theyre laughin at
They say Cheesy rat you aint all that
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it Nothin can save ya
I wanna hang with my man like Lets do this
But this man like Who this
Thats right the brother got two faces
They got me puttin the tips on shoelaces
P on the Puma a mop and a bucket
My motto is I dont care
I dont give a damn so what why try
I might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money
Its so funny
Cars ride by with the boomin system
Sayin Leave him alone my man already dissed him
Now Im on the cheese line povertystricken
As the red tape thickens
I go to the park they wanna baseball bat me
I go to the mall they throw my old tapes at me
Im so horny
And every girl I know be like Hes so corny
I want money in a hurry
Im gettin tired of leftover curry
I wanna fall off but I dont know where the edge is
Im so hungry I eat my neighbors hedges
Now I realize I gotta go for mine
Its windshield time
I take quarters pennies dimes and nickels
And a kiddys tricycle
Im a desperado
Ima steal your rims is my motto
I watch wrestlin until Im dizzy
So if youre cashin your WIC check know how to get busy
Go to the drivethrough run with a milkshake
Go to the supermarket pocket a raw steak
I need beer
Ima catch the Miller truck out there
You know how they throw the newspapers in the morning
The owner dont want em
Im the man that theyre laughin at
They say Cheesy rat you aint all that
Can you feel it
Can you feel it Im starvin 
Can you feel it So yo one more time one more time 
Can you feel it Party people in the house tonight check it out Nothin can save ya
Just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
Keep em there run the jewels run the jewels Run the jewels

I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake her titties aint fake
Fucking in the car cause we just cant wait
To get home early in the morn getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low money by her Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever shes strong
Hear Beyonces song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting we getting it on

I dont even say shit she can feel it
Eye talks the realest toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and its hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm the other is a skillet
Fried chicken macaroni raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince shes my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony Montana
Reminded me a me of my of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a niggas squares not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the cabinets aint closed
When the cameras start snapping shes ready to pose

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldnt mention
For me getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes congresswomen inflictin
Pain onto my game wanted and Im sadistic
They liked it they dyked it devices twisted
til I get a nice chick to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids Labrador behind the white fence
But Im still single looking for Cleopatra
African Queen yo look at me Im a bachelor
Yall niggas in trouble keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers be happy I havent chose yours
She love glamour bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette my manors
Half hood half class photographers cameras
Caught us out there the spotlight hope she can handle this
She can join me red carpet at my next nonprofit
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects

2297,"I see so many people lost who really try to pretend
But am I just another white boy who has caught on to the trend
When I take a step to the mic is hiphop closer to the end
Cause when I go to shows the majority have white skin
They marketed the windmill the air flair and head spin
And white rappers albums really get the most spins
The face of hiphop has changed a lot since Eminem
And if hes taking away black artists profits I look just like him
Claimed a culture that wasnt mine the way of the American
Hiphop is gentrified and where will all the people live
Its like the Central District Beacon Hill to the South End
Being pushed farther away because of what white people did now
Wheres my place in a music thats been taken by my race
Culturally appropriated by the white face
And we dont want to admit that this is existing
So scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege
Cause its human nature to want to be part of something different
Especially when your ancestors are European Christians
And most whites dont want to acknowledge this is occurring
Cause we got the best deal the music without the burden
Of being black in a system that really wants you to rock
Cause all you need is a program and you can go and make hiphop
And we hate the mainstream cause were the ones that took it
Now we listen to Aesop Rock and wear tshirts that say Brooklyn
But its not about black and white right
I mean good music is good music regardless of what you look like
But when you dont give them props isnt that selfish
Thats like saying rock was actually started by Elvis
So where does this leave me
I feel like I pay dues but Ill always be a white MC
I give everything I have when I write a rhyme
But that doesnt change the fact that this cultures not mine
But Im gonna be me so please be who you are
This is something thats effortless and shouldnt be hard
I said Im gonna be me so please be who you are
But we still owe em 40 acres now weve stolen their 16 bars
Hiphop started off on a block that Ive never been to
To counteract a struggle that Ive never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means Im not keeping it true nope
Hiphop started off on a block that Ive never been to
To counteract a struggle that Ive never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means Im not keeping it true Im not keeping it true
Now I dont rap about guns so they label me conscious
But I dont rap about guns cause I wasnt forced into the projects
See I was put in the position where I could choose my options
Blessed with the privilege that my parents could send me to college
Now whos going to shows the kids on the block starving
Or the white people with dough that can relate to my content
Marketed the music now adapted to the lifestyle
What happened to jazz and rock and roll is happening right now
Wheres my place in the music thats been taken by the media
With white corporations controlling what theyre feedin ya
I brought up Aesop Rock but Im not even dissing dude
We love hiphop and what do you think caucasians are listening to
And I speak freely when I write this
If a black MC examined race there goes half their fan base white kids
And this is so true
And we didnt even have to fight the system we just went and picked up the microphone too
And we got good at it so we should be rappin
But only supporting them is like burning Jimi and buying Clapton
Now Claptons incredible but no Jimi no foundation
So here comes history and the cultural appropriation
White kids with dorags trying to practice their accents
From the suburbs to the upperclass mastering a language
But hiphop is not just memorizing words
Its rooted in authenticity something you literally cant learn


But Im gonna be me so please be who you are
This is something thats effortless and shouldnt be hard
I said Im gonna be me so please be who you are
But as Im blessed with the privilege theyre still left with the scars
Hiphop started off on a block that Ive never been to
To counteract a struggle that Ive never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means Im not keeping it true nope

On top of the world
Amani Fela Diani Eshe Ima hold yall down for real Got you 
It was 1996 4th of July looking off in the sky
Dealing with thoughts inside when something caught my eye
It was a silhouette of a beautiful woman bright with life
Carrying my first seed looking like she gone bear fruit tonight
We at the African street festival and she walking around
Talking about the midwife said that bring the baby down
Im about to be a father the sights and sounds seem brighter around me
And for starters I know Ima work harder word
We got home at three in the morning I was beat
Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep
305 like every five minutes then the water broke
We ought to go yelling at the cabbie cause hes sort of slow
You know them hospitals all trying to get paid no questions
Here come the doctors with they drugs trying to do csections
But my baby stays strong in labor for yay long
Eightpound baby boy to carry my name on joy
Huh yeah I know how you feel
Kweli I know how you feel Thats the sound of joy 
See my brother I know how you feel
Kweli I know how you feel Thats the sound of joy 
See when you have a seed come in the world
Say dog that shits real Thats the sound of joy yall 
Huh Kweli yo I know how you feel
Kweli yo I know how you feel My baby girl 
June 10th 1999 I been on the grind
Since the birth of my son its been about way more then rhymes
Baby on the way my lady glowing today
At least thats what the midwife said on the phone anyway
The music got me going away like every day
But its a blessing so I gotta have patience True 
And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation
So its all good this time well have the baby in the house
I went the hospital route I know what they all about Never again 
So Im out on tour in Baltimore
Get the call around four when the water hit the floor Damn 
I gotta rock my show but I gotta go
Got second thoughts about her not going to the hospital
I left the show early Mos held me down good looking No doubt 
Call the car service like Take me straight to Brooklyn Uhhuh 
Got the news in the car stayed sorta calm
But I cried tears of joy when they put my daughter in my arms how precious

I give them the truth so they approach the situation with ammunition
I keep nothing away they hear everything cause they know how to listen
Teach em the game so they know they position
So they can grow and make decisions that change the world and break old tradition
They put kids in jail for a life they aint even get to start
Thats murder too and its breaking my heart its breaking our nation apart
We gave the youth all the anger its just
We aint taught them how to express it and so its dangerous
You cant talk to em unless your language is relating to what they going through
So busy ignoring em you cant see what they showing you
And you wonder why we called baby daddies and baby mamas
When we grow up we cant act like adult mothers and fathers yo

I wish I wasnt so shy I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That Im the perfect nigga for her but then maybe thats a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and its clear Im not that guy
Ball player star player Im just watchin from the side
On the bench cause my lack of confidence wont let me fly
I aint grow up with my father I aint thinkin bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now Ill probably cry
When I realize what I missed but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause Im tryna stay alive in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie

I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along nothing to see

Burnt CDs and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the lowlow sell a
Dime for a dub them white boys aint know no better
Besides whats twenty dollars to a nigga like that
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon get it right back
I peeped game got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip the appeal too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do
His mama at home she still let em hit the blunt though
I told her Hello and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked What a nigga gotta do to get that
Put me on he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me Nigga you know how you sound right now
If you wasnt my mans I would think that you a clown right now
Listen you everything I wanna be thats why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you
You bout to go get a degree Ima be stuck with two choices
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what A hundred bucks or two a week
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me
I got four brothers one mother that dont love us
If they aint want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes there aint no reason to cry
You made a genius and I aint gon take it for granted
I aint gon settle for lesser I aint gon take what they handed
Nah Im gon take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing the illest nigga alive

So when I die put me in a pine box
Bury me like a G two Glocks and a fuckin bag of rocks
And open up clouds for these strangers
Before you take me Lord tell me
Look into the eyes of a killa neighborhood drug dealer
From ghetto hero swore he wouldnt be the next nigga
To lose his life in this dope game cocaine
He told me dont trust nobody his best friend was the trigga man
I see tears in his sista and his momma eye
His old lady stare at the casket askin God why
The church is full of killers and drug dealers
Bangers and motherfuckin cap peelers
Six of his homies carried him to the hearse
First time that he even been to church
Damn now hes in the dirt
Pourin out beer for my dead homey

2164,"I grew up a fucking screwup
Got introduced to the game to the game then fucking blew up
Yeah Dedicated to all my hustlers thats a product of they environment
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man
Yeah Grew up a screw up baby
Got introduced to the game I aint took a breath yet
Lets go
Ever since I was an embryo waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said Wake up and kick out
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical spit the government chip out
Peace up ATown down and then I dipped out
And oh my gosh the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in even my baby stroller was tricked out
Somebody get him the little niggas out of control
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle Ill dream about diamonds and gold
Gold gold to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen
Freshing freshing and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now Im grown with more range than a Texan
And Im a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion
Ayyyy
Yall already know what it is
Imma tell you nigga
CT know what it is bout 175
Homey fronted me a zip shit I made it a bird
Thats seventeen and a half all I need is the word
Say the ice is cool but them pots is hot
You better cook slow but that money come fast
I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash
You know the kid pimping all over the world
A hundred carats got me all over your girl
YEAH five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag
A corporate thug I run with a Playaz Circle
I got a Field Mob thatll Disturb your Peace
Blowing Sean Jay all we do is smoke
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head
Whats up
Imma be all the way real with this look
When I came into the game they aint do nothing but doubt me
Now the whole games changed and it aint nothing without me
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels Hyundais to Bentleys
And five course meals no more Popeyes and Blimpies
From alright to handsome from one room to mansions
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch I bought a
Plane and a boat and six other whips no MARTA
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips but harder
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK Guard your
Women dawg I went from ashy to classy
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars

Ahh ohh What the fuck

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dawg and I cant see
Im tryin to be what Im destined to be
And niggas tryin to take my life away Cmon 
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin with me
My back on the wall now you gon see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause Ill come and take your life away
Many men

Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now man these pussy niggas puttin money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker I aint dead
Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme somethin special happened every time
Im the greatest somethin like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist chip on my shoulder

Sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
Joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin life behind bars
I dont say Only God can judge me cause I see things clear
Crookedass crackers will give my blackass a hundred years
Im like Paulie in Goodfellas you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool why you want me to die homie

Every night I talk to God but he dont say nothin back
I know he protectin me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pullin TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I aint gon spell it out for you mufuckas all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the Bible it says what goes around comes around
Hommo shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fuckin breathin
Many men
Many many many many men

Couldnt goâtoâbed that night
SantaâClaus sliding snow in the driveway
Underâthe litup Christmas tree with my crazyass family
Singing oh oh oh oh I got it 
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again Alright 
Now fill up the gas in the SUV
Spent way too much time tryna pick out our tree
The ceiling aint as tall as we thought I see
Gotta cut a couple inches off the top to proceed
And now we stringing the lights up
Five hours later we stringing the lights up
Listenin to Bing Crosby by the fire
Frank Sinatra Nat King Cole Mariah
Turn off that Michael Bubl
Turn on that one movie about the kid
Who licked the telephone pole on the Bluray
Red Ryder BBGun stayin up all night
Jimmy Stewart Its A Wonderful Life now am I right
The collars puffy the beard is long
The bellys tubby but the reindeer are strong
Its Santa Claus
Its Christmas time
Oh I wish it was 99 when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldnt go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding snow in the driveway
Under the litup Christmas tree with my crazyass family
Singing oh oh oh oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again
Now I wrap presents like a kid wearing mittens
Blindfolded with a pair of lefthanded scissors
Janky but the gift inside Ridiculous
Better than whatever it is you had on your wishlist
Dig in then whip up the Bisquick
Go outside and throw round the pigskin
Im a dad now but still feel like a big kid
Best time of year can I get a amen Amen 
The Almond Roca the hottest cocoa
The track around the tree with the locomotives
I wanted a Jordan poster to measure my growth spurt
Starter logo Georgetown Hoyas
Im going off of the head yall
Homemade cookies that I dip in the eggnog
I wanna take a second and shoutout my dead dog
Toby hes dead


Oh I wish it was 99 when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldnt go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding snow in the driveway
Under the litup Christmas tree with my crazyass family

480,"One side of the street is Malones Funeral Home and the
Other side the library try very hard to picture this shit
Walk through where I live at
Where parents are embarassed to tell you they raise they kids at
Youll need some half and half of an 8ball you can get that
Fuck with Little Rodney and youll get all of your ribs cracked
In a location where slanging crack rock is not seen as a fuckin recreation but a vocation
And the sellers and smokers are both pacing
Got one eye on Minneapolis PT they both racin
3 for 50 is the supply and demand and the
Twin Cities American heartland and they
Been busy masterminds tearing apart plans
And hoop dreamers ballin with blisters on they hands
With chains danglin from the rims
Pain strangles em from within
Till the belt around the arm makes the veins stand at attention
I try to block it out with a bed sheet the moonlights as a curtain
Cause Im not comforted by red and blue lights when Im hurtin
Mommy loves you yeah I knew but I wasnt certain
Cause the lenses through which she views life wasnt workin
As a boy she told me wait til your father to come home
Im 24 still waitin for my father to come home
And some parents only touch they children when a whips brought
Thats why bad kids do bad shit just so they could get caught
And get touched this growing up shits rough
Thats a big part of why were so mixed up
Shit we dont have Bar Mitzvahs
We become men the first time our father hits us
And we dont open gifts up
Sister Regina from across the street is beautiful
But for 50 bucks aint nothing she wont do to you
Used to be premium pussy now she used up
For that same 50 bucks she got to do some new stuff
Whatever it takes for you to pull the dollars out
If you dont intervene then theres a day shell turn her daughter out
Speaking of kids Im fixing lunch for my first born
I had the windows wide open cause the weathers warm
Thats when the greatest hits of Donnie Hathaway
Got interrupted by a driveby shooting half a block away
Faheem was in the window he didnt get hit though
All praise to Allah
3x 
I see all this from the desk that I write my rhymes from
Pen starts to scribble on its own my minds numb
But you can call me modern urban Norman Rockwell
I paint a picture of the spot well

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell word 
Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally thats confusion to a youngn tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say thats where you go when you die
But how they know
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in

Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to

Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons it was a blessing not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and thats where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
Thats why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that aint vein to me
Its just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin to go inside
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup 
Living in mass confusion looking for absolution
The gas seducin and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
Momma say its her after me
Preacher say its blasphemy
I say theres gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God heres you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean
We know hey 
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd dont mean I gotta be no sheep

More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history

2284,"Chad Butler known as Pimp C died in a Los Angeles hotel room
The LA County Coroners office ruled the rappers death accidental and attributed it to a combination of
Apnea
Yes
And syrup and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine
Absolutely we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic
He rolled up asked him what he was sippin on
He said Lean you wanna hit it dawg
Thats the same stuff Weezys sippin huh
And tons of other rappers that be spittin hard
Yup he had five up on
Then went and passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter Pink heard a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip sittin in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimpin as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hotbox let the bass bump
Take it to the face gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddamn he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat just so healin
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up cold sweat scratchin itchin
Tryna escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldnt get off it
Didnt even think he had a problem
Though he couldnt sleep without gettin nauseous
Room spinnin
Thinkin he might have sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutchin that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name shook him but he never got up
He never got up he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinkin that it wont be us
It wont be us it wont be us it wont be us
Nah it wont be us
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed ash in a tin
Pack being pushed harassed by the feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talkin about some shit they havent lived
Surprise you know the drill
Trapped in a box declinin record sales
Follow the formula violence drugs and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
Theres no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup Percocet and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke depressed and emotionally vacant
Despite how Little Wayne lives
Its not conducive to being creative
And I know cause hes my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that Id try after I listen to Dedication
But hes an alien
Id sip that shit pass out or play PlayStation
Months later Im in the same place
No music made feelin like a failure
And trust me its not dope to be twentyfive
And move back to your parents basement
Ive seen my peoples dreams die
Ive seen what they can be denied
And weeds not a drug thats denial
Groundhog Day life repeat each time
Ive seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them we used to chief dimes
Ive seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheatin and lyin
Friendship cease no peace in the mind
Stealin and takin anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken hopeless headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealers supplyin
That rush that drug that dope
Those pills that crumb that roach
Thinkin I would never do that not that drug
Growing up nobody ever does
Until youre stuck
Lookin in the mirror like I cant believe what I become
Swore I was gonna be someone
And growin up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up keep me up
Hollywood here we come


You can tend to um go a little too far with some of these things they have very strong addictive qualities pills and syrups and whatnot so um
Is it changing the music
Um I can only speak for myself personally you know what Im saying
Um we had been taking down toning down the content of certain things in the music lately
My new album of course probably wont have any references to cough syrup in it
But uh its a little bit more than the music

Was my problem solver
Had a def girl really didnt
Wanna involve her
In the life of a gangster
Used to rob bankster
But now Im locked up
Im just a punk low rankster
Jail cells
Know me too damn well
Seems like Ive built on earth
My own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed
Somehow I always fell
Guess a lot of players got
This story to tell
No matter how cold you roll
You simply cannot win
Its always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end
Pain x4 
Organized crimer
Big trouble finder
In and out of institutions
Ever since I was a minor
But now Im on the bricks
Deep in the mix
Crimesmart searching hard
For some new street tricks
I think Ill join a gang
Sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt
And get myself a name
Fresh sneakers silk shirts
247 work
Ninetofive to survive
You gotta be a jerk
I clock two grand a day
Yes I was born to play
Who me At Micky Ds
It wouldnt work no way
Im a big money haver
But not the last laugher
For me infamy
Makes me no autographer
Custody haunts my dreams
Nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance
Phobia of cameras
My banks bigger
But so are my fears
Past records prove players
Live limited years
But Im unlike the rest
Known to be the best
Fast money true wealth
My eternal quest
I hustle all night long
There aint no gain in rest
12 gauge close range
Bloods on my chest
I looked into his face
I thought he was my friend
My boy had me set up
This wound would never mend
No matter who you trust
You simply cannot win
Its always fun in the beginning
But its pain in the end
Pain x4 
Gold rope wearer
Neighborhood terror
Cant hang around my mother
Cause she says I scare her
Got a light sunburn
From too much poolside sittin
Cordless phone keeps me on
Cause there aint no quittin
Minds in a money mode
Seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie
Got a female overload
Young street messiah
Professional liar
19 got a Benz
21 Ill retire
Crazy money it aint funny
Suckers lovin my jock
But theres some people at my door
That didnt even knock
Task force boomin
Doggin my crib out
Cant shout
FBIs got a gun in my mouth
Threw me on the floor
Called my girl a whore
Pulled ten Gs out my mattress
And was lookin for more
Cracked my safe with an axe
Then they laughed to the max
When they seem my money kickin it
In twentyG stacks
Booked me on ten counts
With bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue
Some that I couldnt pronounce
They threw my ass the book
My life was surely took
Then they gave my girl ten years
For hangin out with a crook
She played the game herself
Fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law
Or the citys health
The sweat of hustlers greed
Is not reserved for men
Its always fun in the beginning
But its pain in the end
Pain x5 
Yeah that aint nothin
Cause when I get outta here Imma get right back in the money
Cause they dont know that I know what time it is ya see
I done learned something I did half my time but I can learn more when I was in here
And Imma go right back out and get paid you understand what Im sayin Cause I did half my time Word

You either good or you great you either real or you fake
Thats why I stay spittin the real because the real ones relate
Yall must was raised by some haters you niggas go ahead and hate
FFFour car garage for the Rari that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky glad I aint fall for the bait
So focused and Im determined can see that shit in my face
You niggas go head and face it lil bitch aint shit bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half I got the recipe

Running from state to state gun in the waist for safety
Im on a paper chase whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire silly cause how many really get there
I mean how many niggas is Jeezy
Yall make this shit sound so easy
Breezy turn on the TV see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile back home my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
Cause thats the American Dream
Now here go the thing listen
Hysterical screams coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods I dont got time to explain
Out of fear that I wont reach em and since preaching aint my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already
I just want a big ol bag of money when I see my jeweler

Country names country slang fiends at the liquor sto
Black cruisin craps shootin fifty on the tentofour
Overcast the forecast shows clouds from plenty dro
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia 
Yeah dirty words dirty birds its mean in the Dirty South
If you ever disrespect it then well clean out ya dirty mouth
Bulldogs clockin these lookout boys is hawkin
You gotta be brave in the state of Georgia 
I got five Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones
Come anywhere on my land and Ill aim at ya Georgia dome
If you get into an altercation just hop on ya mobile phone
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of Georgia 
We some ATL thrashers scope ya punk and then smash ya
Well come through ya hood worse than a tsunami disaster
Dont know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit

We on the grind in Georgia all the time

Im from the home of neckbones
Black eyed peas turnip and collard greens
We the children of the corn dirtier than Bob Marleys peepee
GA the Peach State where we stay
My small citys called Albany Georgia 
Hahaha pecan country like catfish with grits
Candy yams and chitlins grandmas homemade baked biscuits
The land of classical Caprices and Impalas and Super Sports
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia Georgia Hahaha 
I love the women out in LA and the shoppin stores in New York
The beaches in MIA but aint nothin like that GA red clay
Look on ya map we right above Florida next to Bama
Under that Carolina to Tennessee youll see Georgia Hahaha 
Where Gladys Knight took the midnight train
The birthplace of Martin Luther King
Where ass so plump and hips are thick
Where Llac trucks sittin on twentysixes
Know where you goin or youll be lost
Found in these plumb trees in the South
These choppersll tomahawk your top down here in Georgia 
Hahaha
We on the grind in Georgia all the time
It aint nothin on my mind but Georgia we aint playin with ya
We on the grind in Georgia all the time
It aint nothin on my mind but Georgia we aint playin with ya
Now I was born in the belly on the bottom of the map
Where the wet paint drip jelly on Pirellis
And the chrome on the Chevys when Im choppin in the trap
Country as hell they some warriors
Tote somethin that spray same shape as Florida
Lookin for me boy youll find me
Down in Dougherty County in a small city
Called Albany Georgia Georgia 
Where they used to call us some bamas
And now they jockin the grammar
Watch your mouth less you out for some manner
But ya hustlers wasnt on every corner
Like the Waffle House in Atlanta
RIP Camoflauge out in Savannah Georgia 
Now you might come for vacation leave on probation
Home of the strip club known for the thick girls
Where the tricks put tips in the tip cup
For the thick chick in the thong with the big butt
Wanna get love Wont be cheap long money like Peachtree
Man she take it off like Freaknik down here in Georgia 
When you see them confederate flags you know what is
Yo folks picked cotton here thats why we call it the field
I got a Chevrolet on twentysixes
Im from GA GA Georgia

His eyes and dreams diverted as the siren screams eternal

Call the coroners to make they bed up
Infrared shit from neck up
Before they got to lift the TEC up
It was a setup
My nigga got hit they blew his chest up
The hollow tips ripped his vest up
Son is messed up and blessed up
Call my cats up its time to dress up

Ready to press up and fuck a nest up
The enemy is Hennessey the sessed up
Actin up hit my motherfuckin man up

These small times cats yo fuck that I cant see that

Ay yo son one is a known cat he walk around with the chrome Gat this hoodrat know where the nigga home at 
Well heres a quarter baby go and phone that
This motherfucker bout to get his shit blown back

Up the boulevards and avenuesn

Mad hot but not in the mood for losin
We hit the strip pickin up clues and
We on the heels of this nigga shoes and
Out the blue when
We see the chick the nigga screwin
Pushin his whip with the ice cuban
Hemmed her up sweet put heat to her wig piece the Sig piece
To this nigs piece this bitch named Charise
From East New York listen bitch you better talk
Or get your whole frame surrounded with white chalk
Pulled her out a back of the van bitch we dont want you
We want your man you understand
The ho said Please I got his house keys the nigga got Five kis and Mad cheese a hundred Gs
Lie to me bitch you gettin one a these
Fourfive Cs in both knees she said Honestly I promise G

We hit the road me and my niggas flying
To the crib in Jackson Heights
The nigga live three flights up he type buck
But I aint givin a fuck
Grab his bitch up
Make the ho go first in case the nigga buck
Open the door up and put the stunt in front
Then we all started creepin
He stretched out up on the sofa sleepin
Yeah me and my cats standin there just peepin
Moneys about to get laced
My nigga Ty threw a glass a whiskey in his face
Big Jan ready to blaze the place
He on his way to Amazing Grace
Nigga woke up and saw the big guns
Me and my two sons he knew he was done
He hurt a loved one step back about to let him have one
Yo fuck that aiyyo black where the sack of heroin at
Im bout to give cat some motherfuckin railroad tracks
We dumped the whole bag inside a spoon and left the room
To heat that and came right back yo grab the nigga arm black
Put raw shit in the nigga vein watch the needle drain
Went from being restrained to mad tame
Less than a moment nigga started zonin
His mouth foamin lookin like he possessed by The Omen
His bitch was reachin for the phone and
I had to smack her with the chrome and
Left her on the floor moanin
Cocked back I had to finish this
Know my stee we leave no witnesses
Shot n got the fuck out the premises

The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers youve lost cause players youre not gangstas you aint
Youre faintin punk if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo the pusher the player the pimp gangsta the hustler
High Roller dead pres folder
Is cold lampin like a black king on a throne
Evil Eturn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin tape
Another album to make Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his lac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science Youre dumb
Stupid ignorant dont even talk to me
At school you dropped Math Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing you got heart
To perpetrate youre bait so just wait
Till the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now why not
You start to sweat and fret it gets hot
Howd you get into this spot
You played yourself
Yo yo you played yourself
Im no authority but I know the DEAL
When it comes to dealin with the females
What you got they want cash is what they need
Slip sucker and theyll break you with speed
But you meet a freak you try to turn her out
Spendin moneys what Im talkin about
But you fool out your pockets got blew out
And after the date no boots you got threw out
Mad and shook cause your ducats got took
Call her up phones off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip
You cant buy no relationship
You played yourself
Yo homeboy you played yourself
Im in the MC game a lot of MCs front
And for the money theyre sell out stunts
But they claim that theyre rich and that they keep cash
Yo let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin bout gold
You better double that then double that again
And still dont get souped my friend
You think youve made it youre just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny fans
But you diss em cause you think youre a star
That attitude is rude you wont get far
Cause theyll turn on you quick youll drop like a brick
Unemployments where youll sit
No friends cause you dissed em too
No money no crew youre through
You played yourself
Thats right you played yourself
You played yourself
Yo yo you played yourself
You got problems you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take

Even when youre not around I feel you

Im runnin wit some of da baddest men in the whole New York
We hold the fort while you crab cats is holdin tips
Playa hatin pushin stolen whips
We at da dice game rollin trips out of town throwin bricks
Taking over cooking up coke with baking soda
I buy hot jewels and ice it down while you go to the jewellery store wit short doe tryna bring the prices down
You betta spread wit them 30 dollar kicks on

Yo its amazing L is blazing always been
Before i put da braids in i use to let the waves spin

Go head and front so i can try this right hand out
Across yo jaw L neva lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce tha law

Then send them home corleone is known to be stoned
When i bone i rubber duck in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the grey BM went to the ATM

In da club knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom pissed Cristal out
Now im thinkin what chick number i can dial out

If it aint Cristal boo i guess its Prignon
If the nanas too tight i throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the 9 mil burst
Ive been off the scene over 3 years and cats is still thirst

2293,"And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you cant plan it
Its always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you cant plan it
Its always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
Now I dont know why this world is a trip
See I just float by hoping that I can live
With a pen Im so high using this medicine
I got a little bit of it to give
Come on hear me now
My momma says the trip inside of you gon hear it child
We all got it if you want it gotta get it out
I know you know what Im talking about
See its the music from the magic got me on top of these clouds come on
Keep it poppin with my favorite song
Theres no feeling like the city walking with my walkman on
It gets to me giving me goosebumps and Im gone
And when I die just make sure that I got my pen and headphones on
In good times and upsets
Rain hail beats sand heat land and a lot of damn sunsets
They say that you can never capture the moment
Photograph or record it but I swear I can when I bump them
As I bear witness to existence setting in the distance
For a sheer instance I become one with it
Dismeant up to ten when I listen like I was set on this mission
Places Ive been when I with them
Im feeling the most high when I got my pen and Im scriptin
No engines speakin as I enter religion
No crosses pews prayers or repentance for sinning
Just the RCA jack a sentence and a vision
Inside of the gut time with the cut right from the plug
That feeling that goes right into us
Instead of bump live but with eyes wide shut
You got some fire and a lighter Imma fire it up
Depending on the month sometimes I feel high with just pen and pad
If the gab the lights within us
I can apply my touch on the mic stand and bust
To the whole planet and my headphones on


And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you cant plan it
Its always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you cant plan it
Its always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
Now have you ever done hallucinogenics
Children dont get it twisted Im not reccomending
But its not fried brains and hippies and kids jumpin off buildings
It can be spiritual epiphanies and medicine
Now I first tried shrooms when I was 16
And the universe became more interesting
I began to contemplate my place in this landscape
And reflect on what it meant to be a human being
What I went through felt as though I dreamt it
Through my experience became aware of my breath then
Began to cultivate my art with the intention of the heart
Started to use my sentences as reflections
And what I saw was God was in all of us
And wed all come to be interconnected
And all that was depended on all of us
And had effects like a domino when you let it
Go with the flow that the universe holds
Understand that theres more than you expected
I dont do shrooms anymore cause I dont need to explore
All that I was looking for was was the present
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you cant plan it
Its always there in front of us
Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And then I remembered the magic
Forgot that you cant plan it

Just trust and it happens
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it",with just pen and pad If the gab the lights within us I can apply my touch on the mic stand and bust To the whole planet and my headphones on And then I remembered the magic Forgot that you cant plan it Its always there in front of us Just trust and it happens And the star dust from the universe of this planet I just get stressed when I try to understand it And then I remembered the magic Forgot that you cant plan it Its always there in front of us Just trust and it happens And the star dust from the universe of this planet I just get stressed when I try to understand it Now have you ever done hallucinogenics Children dont get it twisted Im not reccomending But its not fried brains and hippies and kids jumpin off buildings It can be spiritual epiphanies and medicine Now I first tried shrooms when I was 16 And the universe became more interesting I began to contemplate my place in this landscape And reflect on what it meant to be a human being What I went through felt as though I dreamt it Through my experience became aware of my breath then Began to cultivate my art with the intention of the heart Started to use my sentences as reflections And what I saw was God was in all of us And wed all come to be interconnected And all that was depended on all of us And had effects like a domino when you let it Go with the flow that the universe holds Understand that theres more than you expected I dont do shrooms anymore cause I dont need to explore All that I was looking for was was the present And then I remembered the magic Forgot that you cant plan it Its always there in front of us Just trust and it happens And the star dust from the universe of this planet I just get stressed when I try to understand it And then I remembered the magic Forgot that you cant plan it Its always there in front of us Just trust and it happens And the star dust from the universe of this planet I just get stressed when I try to understand it,And then I remembered the magic Forgot that you cant plan it Its always there in front of us Just trust and it happens And the star dust from the universe of this planet I just get stressed when I try to understand it And then I remembered the magic Forgot that you cant plan it Its always there in front of us Just trust and it happens And the star dust from the universe of this planet I just get stressed when I try to understand it Now I dont know why this world is a trip See I just float by hoping that I can live With a pen Im so high using this medicine I got a little bit of it to give Come on hear me now My momma says the trip inside of you gon hear it child We all got it if you want it gotta get it out I know you know what Im talking about See its the music from the magic got me on top of these clouds come on Keep it poppin with my favorite song Theres no feeling like the city walking with my walkman on It gets to me giving me goosebumps and Im gone And when I die just make sure that I got my pen and headphones on In good times and upsets Rain hail beats sand heat land and a lot of damn sunsets They say that you can never capture the moment Photograph or record it but I swear I can when I bump them As I bear witness to existence setting in the distance For a sheer instance I become one with it Dismeant up to ten when I listen like I was set on this mission Places Ive been when I with them Im feeling the most high when I got my pen and Im scriptin No engines speakin as I enter religion No crosses pews prayers or repentance for sinning Just the RCA jack a sentence and a vision Inside of the gut time with the cut right from the plug That feeling that goes right into us Instead of bump live but with eyes wide shut You got some fire and a lighter Imma fire it up Depending on the month sometimes I feel high

Man Im a real trill nigga nigga I been out on them blocks
With them hustlers hustlers them dealers dealers and killers sellin rocks
Put in work in round the clock from when the sun went down
til it came back up and night came back around around 
I did a lot of shit them late nights for the dough
Robbin niggas on the low low laughed at em then I go go 
Sometimes it went smooth and nobody got hurt
And sometimes I had to leave a niggas dick up in the dirt
I aint proud of what I did and if I could go back in time time 
Id try to find another way instead of packin nines
Totin Ks and holdin macs macs 
But we know time aint rollin back
And hungry hyenas they aint foldin jack
So on these cold and black streets wolves keep huntin
And a young black man can lose his life over nothin
If I gotta go please let it be for somethin real
Cause this bullshit hood shit is gettin niggas killed on the real
Ohohhhhh if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain

Or if I catch a motherfucker dippin in the back dippin in the back 
Say if a nigga disrespect me or my fam

And Imma represent where Im from represent where Im from 
Man I dont wanna die die but I aint scared to I aint scared to 
Shit I just wanna make sure that Im prepared to Im prepared to 
Cant leave without a couple tickets in the stands
So my wife and my momma and my chilren got cans chilren got cans 
Cause once Im gone who gon take care of my kids take care of my kids 
And do the same thangs for em that I did
Man Id rather do a bid bid 
At the least they can see me behind the glass glass 
Instead Im reminiscin bout the past about the past 
Nigga dont know what he got until he passes on
So let him tell em that he love em fore his ass is gone
If a nigga die tonight

Ohhhh if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain

Niggas gettin robbed so Im ridin with my AR
They are not finna take what I done paid for no 
Walkin through the bricks on my Jena 6 shit
Like if you aint from around here you was gettin hit cmon 
Send a OG some flicks make they time go by quick hey 
You surprised what some pictures in the penitentiary did yeah 
We survived but most of us die for some bullshit
Go to church but the devils standin on the pulpit damn 
Niggas lied just to kick it what swear to God they got a meal ticket
Then they call you and they bout to get evicted I know 
A Underground King Ive been one ever since I was sixteen cmon 
Pimp and Bunll tell you just what Buck mean whats up

My whole team go to the feds or get a hole in the head

Yeah Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of hell Boo 
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
KILL
This is the name that came to alter the game
Not like these rappers who spit it the same
Separate lames from they chain
My mind dont slack
Im totally focused on beating up tracks
Monsterous music to beat in your Lac
1000 watt amp with woofers in back
Lean to da left if you burning a sac
Baby got back and its in Baby Phat
Pardon me dog 4 chasing the cat
Im hittin all kittens meowing like that
I like the front but Im loving the back
I like to bite and Im hoping she scratch
Escalade dipping Im holding the lane
Mamas a scholar she blowing my brain
Aint that the life
Snapping Trappin and Rappin Frappin all night
Lil mamas a plumber she handling pipe
Ill wit a pill she handle it right
Like Iverson the smallest thing on the team
But the livest one
Cocked loaded bust like a gun
Yall better run one one
Thump thump thump thump yeah 
All in your trunk yeah 
Grinding and hustling and getting at mine
Swerving and token and grippin on pine
Bump bump bump bump
All in your trunk
Woofers and tweeters and speakers and geekers
Crawl in your bunk
How we gon stop whooa 
How we gone quit shitttt 
Brand new shoes and socks on the Chevy
I came through swerving like this errrrr 
Good wit the game gutter fo show
Ducking you lames and obstacles
Dont get that ass in a hospital
Wrapped in a cast from head to toe
This boy he real
Racing those candy Sevilles through Dixie Hills
My car do wheelies they drive on three wheels
First round pick like Michael Vick
Quarterback status throw passes at chicks
Santana Moss When catching the ball
Get it Like Moss she catches the ball
Perfectly tuned my engine dont stall
And Im equipped with nitros yall
Ready to rip burn roar
Ready to tear through your city and tour
Took The Whole World and murdered that shit
Caught the beat running and dipped with that bitch
Later for now Im hustling hits
Flipping my words like bricks trick
New new That newnew
Newnew for youyou

2252,"To really to be a creator you must ask yourself In the stillest moment of your night if it were truly denied you to create would you die And if your answer is yes you have no choice That is your choice because there is no euphoria in a different place for an artist Thats where you are thats what you do Thats it and its not an easy life but its your life
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Cause the musics my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Instead of staying the same
Cause I see better days ahead of me
I paint them on the page
Then I save them for the rainy ones
When anger and the anguish want to hang around
I say em outloud and complain to them
I figure Im made to live and havent gone that far
But I made it here so if there is a God I give thanks to him
Then I take the pen and make amends again
The only way I know to repent
I know somebodys listenin
Dear God Im so thankful for you keeping my plate full
The struggles heartache pain the progress and the breakthrough
Every single track has made who I am to this day
Through this page is the only way to paint you
But lately its like my soul feels counterfeit
Scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it
So God grant me the serenity without giving me the christening
Because all I ever needed was a beat and people listening
Step Cousins
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Cause the musics my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up Good Morning 
Im gonna change my ways


Instead of rotting away and plotting my grave hiding in a bottomless shame
I found a way to fight my way out and see the light of day
And proud to say I took the safe route but theres a price to pay
They like to keep my name in they mouth and tell lies on me
What you see is what you get truth in the flesh homie
You can do the rest Im through with trying to prove myself to you
Ill see you when you wake up hope the feeling is mutual
Now for artists and musicians you see the targets to listen
To the heart and then script it with no margin no limits
To make to pain strengths sun rays a part of the picture
And convey it in every shade and take it farther and vivid
Theyre gonna say what they say to barge in the vision
And whatever the DJ plays they market the gimmick
But Ive got a path to follow and the longer the distance
I realize Im already awake
Im just starting to live it
My language
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Cause the musics my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper

Its time to escape but I dont know where the fuck Im headed
Up or down right or left life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer you know what the deal is
Nigga you know what the real is
I see some off brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin Yo Daz whats up with the Pound
Is that nigga Snoop alright Ayo whats up with the crew
Is them niggas in jail or are them niggas through

Make that twist dont be a bitch let these niggas know
Whats up witchu I represent the Pound and Death Row
And cant no other motherfucker in LA or Long Beach
And Compton and Watts see DOGs
Now you cant come and you cant run and you cant
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need to put you to rest
Pump pump Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping

Cause I drops bombs like Platoon ayy nigga 
Walk with me hold my hand and let me lead you
Ill take you on a journey and I promise I wont leave you I wont leave you 
I wont leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do thats when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open cause you dont wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your bustaass homeboys dwell well
Suicide its a suicide

Not picanic baskets picanic caskets
And I got the machine to crack your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal jagged edged totally roughneck

If you psycho you can do this if he chooses to be foolish
The gun never loses never give you the deuces
Nigga this is SuWu biz ahh
Let me calm my nerves Ima simply put this on the word

Ayy fuck all that goin back and forth with a nigga
Got a problem what he really wanna do
If you know like I know then you know true
And niggas make songs but they really dont do
What they say got guns but they really wont shoot
He afraid Ill lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete nose to the ground
Do him in the streets fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around its enough
Eat a bullet from the fourpound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off Ill believe you aint soft
Otherwise nigga you just soft as all them other guys
Ill kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Dont listen to these niggas they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns Shot em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low all my niggas headed for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF
Thats your business nigga none of mine
I know Young Gotti bout what he rap bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around two weeks had a whole ki
Just cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead

1757,"Back in the 70s it was all about drugs 
Tie my arm up at night between shows
Takin soda tops off of soda pops
I used to be up all night in the living room
Smokin a lot of weed with the Four Tops
Makin collect calls back home to my pops
My little brother said Keith you need to stop
I knew something was wrong
When I gave away my VHS and sold a pair of my socks
The IRS callin me gettin on my nerve I was warned by Redd Foxx
My girl Keith you seen my diamond rings in the jewelry box
I dont know last night you and Chaka Khan was in here sniffin blow
I was in the room sweatin thinkin about the rent playin bingo
The landlord said the first of the month we gotta go
Packed up my bag and met Darryl Strawberry in the mall
I told James Brown stop smokin angel dust and the pistal
He wanted to go up to the Olive Garden and start a resteraunt brawl
Mary J Blige my son dont accept them type of phone calls
I cant come out tonight my Bic lighter dont light
I heard you and KCi in the background
Im screamin did the cops come and break up the fight
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs drugs
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs
Freebasin eighteen pounds of coke with Marvin Gaye
Put that on the table lets parlay
With Smokey Robinson and Bootsy lightin aluminum foil
Watch that crack pipe boil
With Richard Pryor we burned the house down gettin higher
Dont think Im bluffin
Meet Tommy Lee Curtis Keith Richards Eddie Kingwards and David Ruffin
Rick James was in the kitchen lightin the flame
And Mouseys trapped with Cuba Gooding Sr
I dont want nobody to know my name
I kept glasses on it was a damn shame
Losin weight fallin out in big arenas
The same guy who used to deal to me
Deals to Whitney and Bobby meet Ike and Tina
Every Saturday mansions was packed Hey Jimmy you got the smack
Shut up You dont know how to act
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs drugs
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs
Crystal methane and heroin and quaaludes
A relapse of your mind
Angel dust ecstasy sniffin coke baby
Got the best of meheeeheeeee
I got rits withdrawals my symptoms of pain
Rush me to the hossspitallll
Oooh ooh baby
Get this monkey off of MY MY MY BACK
And get him off of me
Get the monkey off my BACK Baby
Get the monkey
And get the monkey off my back now

725,"Southern leaves southern trees we hung from
Barren souls heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating fathers from children
Institution aint just a building
But a method of having black and brown bodies fill them
We aint seen as human beings with feelings
Will the US ever be us Lord willing
For now we know the new Jim Crow
They stop search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us

The caged birds sings for freedom to ring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being a pastoral scene
Slaverys still alive check Amendment 13
Now whips and chains are subliminal
Instead of nigga they use the word criminal
Sweet land of liberty incarcerated country
Shot me with your raygun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business Americas the company
Investing in injustice fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise its a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them so we can free us

The X Men drinkin tea watchin chicks with D cups
Spiderman saw Doctor Oct spittin off the top of a New York City bus
City Island eatin shrimps
Throwin fries in water to swans and ducks
Itd be wrong to the universe if I drive with a monster green Lamborghini up
All the 5s come out to reunite throw their beanies up
I molest cholesterol yous a fine tune abuser
The Yankees lost but the blue and orange team amuse us

2448,"Its 1995 a lot of brothers done died
A lot of sisters them mothers them fathers
And aunties and grandmas left to cry
Now he nothing but a memory used to be a friend to me
Said hed never die but now hes six feet deep with a tombstone
Oh my god my brothers gone
And I dont even fucking think I can go on
Cause it hurts to lose someone you love
To this madness and killing murder shootemup this game of drugs
Doctors pumped his chest my daddy said let him rest
A team rolled up and put him to his final test
Hands got cold god rest his soul
He walked out his body to another fucking episode
Then the window opened then they put him in the final frontier
You know what happened in the end
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
Front back side to side
But who would be the next victim to roll in that black ride
Front back side to side
It might be you to be the next victim to take a ride in the black ride
Just another homicide for the West County Times
Fools gettin took out the game at the fuckin drop of a dime
The games gettin deep I toss in my sleep
But would a young nigga live to see 23
Killing dont phase me fools think Im crazy
Muslims on every corner handin out black daisies
Name scratched off the wall aint no final call
Used to slang bean pies now its bout that white ball
Only fifteen already got fiends
And working the ghetto like Jack Stark could work some beans
Livin off a high gold ones on this ride
Bitches on the side but only livin to retire
Aint that a shame took him out the game
Same fool we used to roll with yelled out his name
Popped him in his chest didnt wear his vest
Same day his kid took his first step he took his last breath
Whos under the white sheet Somebody bring the yellow tape
The ghetto took him under today will be a sad day
Aint no time to cry no time to shed no tears
You know the way he died the same way he lived
Who was his killer Found him dead on his knee
Same room he left his wife and kid left to grieve
Hopin that this a nightmare one pop and hes outta there
God rest his soul left his kid in a wheelchair
Stabbed for his life his daddy took the ghetto flight
And at the funeral mama say Boy you know its gonna be alright
But now hes gone aint nobody to run his home
Another kingpin stripped from that ghetto throne
Lost at the game of life aint no time to think twice
The same fool he trusted and now sleeps with his wife
Tagged his toe slapped him in the ziplock
Another nigga flipflop popped while slanging that crack rock
Now hes gone Amazing Grace his last song
Six ballers carried out the church to take his ass home
4 limos 3 Cutlass 2 El Doggs a cop and the hearse
Everybody had their lights on
When the straps pops to lower him down in the grave
See it was sad the way his fucking family misbehave
His family crying but everybody gots to die
But you wont feel what they feel until somebody in your family dies
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
Front back side to side
But who will be the next victim to roll in that black ride
Front back side to side
It might be you the next victim to take a ride in the black ride
Front back side to side
It might be me the next victim to take a ride in the black ride

452,"So I never told the world that the first time I toured
I came home to find that little man had been ignored
Two years old got a hold of water you had boiled
And burned his little head and his face while you snored
You were afraid of bringing him to the hospital
Cause two weeks ago your mom called the cops on you
Child protection paid a visit
Ruled that the crib was unfit to raise kids in
Im working ten hour days at the gig then
You were unemployed all null and void
Now I aint trying to be no Sigmund Freud
But aint you supposed to have instincts when it comes to the boy
I called a cab and took him to county hospital
They shaved hair and burnt flesh off his skull
Held him overnight to fight infection
I slept sitting up in a chair directly next to him
I just knew you would join us but instead
Hopped your ass on the bus went home and went to bed
Thats the very moment I divorced you in my head
God might forgive you for that I never did
All you need right now
Faheem we can see the throne from here
I may never sit there but brother youre the heir
Pull up a chair let pop bend your ear
Here baby dry those tears
I know you wonder why your mother does the things that she do
Well its not because she doesnt love you
Its because she grew up in something they call foster care
Thats when strangers raise you your moms not there
Imagine how she felt when she was your age
Going from place to place never feeling safe
Never having love never having faith
She probably thought the world was a big scary place
Where was her mommy at well thats kind of sad
She used drugs to forget the problems she had
There was a new one back then they called crack
Once you try it there was almost no coming back
She couldnt be the mommy she wanted to be
She was chasing a high all in the street
Wont tell you no lie real is all I can be
I believe only truth can set you free
Theres a whole lot of pain in your bloodline
But theres a whole lot of strength in the sunshine
Lean back let the new day greet you
Cause youre standing on the shoulders of a people
Who been beat down and treated unequal
But the prayer that they made now has reached you
Its plain to see its true
Beautiful prince I wish they could see you
All you need right now

541,"Say this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred
CL Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met we wasnt on the same page
From petty misunderstandings that got clearer with age
Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put PA on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Bigtyme put down a few songs
Everybody cosigned saying that we could do no wrong
Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped Tell Me Something Good took off and went live
Shit next thing you know we was signing to Jive
Dropped Too Hard to Swallow A Pocket Full of Stones
Put the remix on Menace shit we had it going on
Got love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out wasnt playing too fair
Had to separate ourself bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side aint always what it seems
We dropped Super Tight a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes
We didnt realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice
Took a while to catch on to what homey was doing
But by the time we did all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldnt file taxes
The next thing you know IRS hitting us with axes
Pimp you owe seven figures Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM almost got put on the shelf
Fuck it dropped Ridin Dirty instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title shut everybodys mouth
Got some clout in the game boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters
The old manager calling and say he fina sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets and we cant keep the people waiting
He made a call or two to some folks tellin em man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan Bun got the drawl
RapALot had our back and we just waiting on Jive
We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the NY
Its JayZ saying yall niggas getting fly
He doing Volume 3 and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggas rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it but Pimp wasnt sure
But Big Pimpin hit em 187Pure
Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated cant believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded
And it stated that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and well be on the way
Shit it sounded okay but me I had to ask
If we dont do Big Pimpin 2 would you still put us on blast
A song like that would might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base might think a nigga flop
They got mad and put niggas on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix
We put Dirty Money together and it was aces
But thats around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation said fuck you hoes
We finish the album got ready to do a couple shows
And then he violated one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done we back to the nitty gritty
Album got released big showdown in Chocolate City
Niggas with masks on vests and all black
Its Christmas 2001 bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block nobody could budge
And then he violated now we right back before the judge
They calling him a nuisance put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th he aint been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
In stead of coCEO now Im the fuckin boss
Had the devil on my back got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please
Let me get past this bridge over water thats trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son dont worry
Cause its not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams
You just got to stay true to yourself and to C
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before Im breaking em G
Not to mention I got the world screaming Free Pimp C
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You aint gotta worry about nothing the world is yours
Aint no mo struggles my nigga and no mo strife
I kept it real because to me its UGK for life

1714,"I knew a youngster met him at 14 a very short scene
Fiendin to make his dreams come true but see money was caught mean
Started runnin wild and livin life type of foul that was my shortys style
But deep down in heart he was still only a child
He was taking nice to ball if he had height yall
Mighta been NBA Today instead I watched his life fall
Blowin up the spots and poppin them tec Glocks
Collectin street props splittin tops didnt stop so many men dropped
Started committin murder after murder
Blasted the last nigga that tried to be so fast he flipped him like a burger
Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger
In this type of street its violence today happens too often
That hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin
People droppin a rose when the casket is closed
Hey yo thats the name of the game out on the street thats how it goes
They say Live by the trigger Die by the trigger
It aint about whose gun is more bigger Nigga its bout whose draw is quicker
So to my shorty dog Puzzle Im pledgin
Died at the age of 17 Brooklyn East New York legend
Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers 
Keep it real on the street money and look out for one another
Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers 
Keep it real on the street money and look out for one another
Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers 
Keep it real on the street money and look out for one another
Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers 
Keep it real on the street
Thinkin back when I was chillin with KVon but now hes long gone
So I carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on
Me and black go way back to in childhood when we was wild hoods
Runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good
Started hangin hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
Then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards
Then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
Started bouncin uptown to stock up my nigga straight blew the block up
Yeah the blue and whites was on sight runnin with flashlights
On the double in fast flight thats when he seen his last nights
Out on the street runnin from the heat
Got knocked and locked up from Happy New Year all the way down to Trick or Treat 
The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes got back on crackin
I let him whip the Max and go lookin for hoes
And then another sad story is headed for me
When I found out another soldier died in the territory
So in memory of my dog I write a lyric
Straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit
Hear it when I get biz for KVon Im pledgin
Died on 104 Northern Boulevard Corona Queens legend
Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers 
Keep it real on the street money and look out for one another
Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers

686,"Yo Houston to Earth watch the Ripper crucify you with verse
My urethra to ya uvula quenches your thirst
Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk
Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapon search
Strap a bomb to one of your labels record clerks
And activate it as soon as they get to work
Ring the alarm red alert nigga it gets worse
Bypass security networks with select words
Megahertz make nebulas reverse till your head burst
Call the press first and ask them who got the best verse
Give me the respect I deserve
If you are what you eat its obvious I cant eat what Im worth
Yall niggas eat pussy and burp
The other half of yall suck dick till your jaws and ya neck hurt
When you address me nigga end your sentence with Sir
Critics went berserk they aint even heard my best work
See I broke into the mind by
Quietly going by their eardrum walls and hotwired they skulls
Yeah I earned the name Canibus but what did it cost
Battle rap is nothing but a serendipitous whore
Niggas probably like what the fuck he dissing him for
Yeah he dissed me first but you was never informed
Im one of the top five nigga my shit is tight nigga
You heard it right nigga I rock mics nigga
But the limelight isnt where I belong
The top four dont even look in the mirror no more
If they did Id be in the mirror looking back at em
Ready to grab them kidnap them and put them on my album
I rip jackers Rip the timespace fabric
Loop the future with the past tense looking for patterns
Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons
And forced black men to pay taxes
Attack a wack bitch with counter tactics
Split your bullet proof chassis in half with a rapid Gatling
Keep firing at you till you trapped in
Noncombatants scramble for helicopter extraction
While Im back at Fort Bragg bragging
How I tortured them faggots and stabbed them with Rip the Jacker daggers
Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts
I found in the cabinet written in Arabic
Translate to characters one by one like Arafat tarot cards suggest
I make terrorist threats through your stereo sets
Various anthrax carriers sending sarin to the press
With an imaginary address Canis the best
Untraceable your pictures unpaintable canvas thats wet
Let me dry you off wit some of this fire I spit
26 years old nigga look how I spit
A microphone fiend since I was like 14
My Cuban uncle used to sell cocaine OK
Im reloaded you fucking wit the wrong MC
CreutzfeldtJakob disease to the whole industry
Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee
One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely
Nowadays a hundred bars aint impressive to me
You stepping to me nigga do it intelligently
You wanna battle or you wanna fucking wrestle wit me
You aint better than me you just got an obsession wit me
Canibus hybrid the cake icing of rhymeness
As I grow older I get colder like the declining climate
Of earths environment Im entirely tireless
Rhymes come from my higherness of wireless dialect
Scientists from Sirius B designed my specs
Astrally project during heightened sex chakras connect
Doctors inspect what they cant possibly interpret yet
Thats why they revert to threats
They curse and throw fits
They like immature earth cadets looking like Captain Kirk in a dress
Lyrically I step on you rip on you
Then I defecate what I just digested on you
Im better than you Im better than you Im better than you
Just to get the chequered flag Ill put the pressure on you
Put the extra effort on you write a motherfucking letter to you
And your editors too threatening you
Detective check your mail and your messages too
You can take this verbal slashing that I left as a clue
Execute the type of wickedness the devil approves
Which basically means I can do whatever with you
Im a rap music mutant with a cool name
Misconstrue fame but I spit butane
Blue flames out giant CO2 tanks
Demagnetize memory banks enhanced advanced
One of a kind like modern mans retina scans
Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps
What you want me to break first Your jaw or your grill
What type of spit you want from me Sparkling or still
Study law Yale draw up my own deals
So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel
Spread the ganglia from Tanzania
To the flats of East Anglia give up you cant keep up
The man eater in a wife beater
Spreading Typhoid Fever through mic receivers with light reverb
Type in the right keywords I might emerge
Takes a really nice nigga to incite these nerds
Niggas wanna see the gully in me keep fucking with me
Never under pressure I keep the pressure under me
Burn the weed
Drop a freestyle on the internet then watch niggas burn the CD
Upload a picture of your mum getting DPd
Im one size away from 13 believe it she peed
Im the illest and its gonna be that way forever

We livin life close to the edge dont push
But this aint eightythree and its not the Cold Crush
Its kids on the street strapped huffin that kush
They eyein the next cat livin all plush
I guess frustration make a brother do what he must
Whats the combination that can make a human erupt
Team leaders gettin mutinied up who couldnt read
The signs thinkin the day and times is like Tariq
Indeed we blast refuse to kiss ass
Quick fast ready to mash cause of a bugged out past
Swallow the pain follow the mental terrain
It takes a hell of a man nowadays to maintain
Garments bloodstained face bruised and battered
Our eyes reflect the agony of dreams that were shattered
And they love it when we wild out and kill our own
But the greater responsibility yes is still our own
Uhh worldwide famine ghetto people demand
That somebody do somethin soon and lets examine
The facts behind the violent attacks
Behind the daily gunplay the cocaine and the crack
Thug season whats the reason for the treason
Everybodys gotta eat some gotta resort to thievin
Take money money make money money money
Yo from the time they eyes open til the clock strike death
Brothers is stressed walkin round holdin they chest
They got the government surveyin they steps and cant breathe
They dynamitin them projects to smithereens
Money comin but them days too few and far between
You tryin to taste just what the worlds offering yamean
I seen enough to make a grown man scream
Brothers thirsty and hungry to get that thing
Too many tears of pain too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available too few schools equipped
Too few role models just gangsters and pimps
Will you succumb will your heart grow numb
Or will you save the world and use your mind like a gun
Im the one I turn a stickup kid to a soldier

I never had love so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought Id have to choose
Between paradise and you
I still creep on your Gram oh
See you with you and your man oh
And I scroll and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history aint happened long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity and we repeat it
Momma said we need counseling
But I cant reason with a terrorist
Oh this is embarrassing
You aint Cinderella aint no pumpkin turn them into fuckin carriages
You create a narrative people ask me Wheres she been
Send her packing now shes living back out at her parents crib
Fight break up we fuck we fight break up you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them This the last time Im for real
You text me then the next thing you know Im behind the wheel
Pull up fuck you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There is no use for you texting my phone
Got FOMO the minute I walked out the door
Cant get in the gate because I changed the code
Now you can toast to the love we dont make anymore
We got that bad love but it taste like medicine
I never had love so I learned to settle quick

Back on the Shit I was busy
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobodys listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception back to the selfwill
Back on that Well she dont do it and I know that somebody else will
You cheated I cheated you cheated I cheated I mean it please Father forgive us
The dirt that youve done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I tried to cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish that isnt commitment
I try to hold it and I try to hold it and
Numb to it all and ignoring it
Im just searching where the closure is
Going in circles not noticing
But in my heart I know Im not over it


We got that bad love but it taste like medicine
I never had love so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought Id have to choose
Between paradise and you

Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin hide your rocks hydraulic
The kid with the most knowledge will obtain and touch top dollars
Hold me down hand me my cake
Dust and bake activate
Fuck your corny debates
Im like cake or maybe like ten thousand dollar rabbits
The kid walked through switch up his accent now Im from Paris
Cash the bill frozen elements in gold
Signs from the most high causes me to break the mold
How the fuck was yall niggas thinkin
You think I fell off the ledge
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead
Never impossible pull out black burners like tonsils
Two Galants hittin if we got to
Bustin at yall niggas daily wall to wall hawkin
Suckin your teeth cause God chaintalkin
Like Ghostface this Ghostface that Ghost sold crack
Now his revelations spoken through rap
Veloured down like the Sheikh of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans Michael Davis its me against housing
Extraordinary problack sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks Apollo rap Frederick Douglass
You know what Aiyo fuck this
Aiyo how can I move the crowd
First of all aint no mistakes allowed
Heres the instructions put it together

You mightve bumped into me on the Rikers bus
Weed in my cheeks gem in my beauty sleep sleeve
Dead serious knowledge by 2 triple geese
Come on we juggle mics
Three Card Molly amps advance to the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night Jamaica
Came through in a booger green 68 Pacer
Mad paper high as a fuck truck
Two rappers got stuck that night I aint saying no names
They know who thank you for the chains
Outdoor event New Years Eve Cali weed
30 seconds til we tear and decease
Quick call my seeds dipped in the crowd
The ho spotted me he knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly we exactly
Formed like Christ and his disciples
Black fatigues lethalfaced doonie he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook
Your favorite rappers droppin they drinks
On the low tuckin they links we made eighty off the books
One of the illest since Magic Johnson no disrespect
But metaphorsll keep me out the projects
Rap connectsll keep me correct
Aiyo I wrote this on Donnie roof after his funeral on one knee
Thinkin his killers followin me
So to my nigga Donnie up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here
You got beer weed guns AIDS
All these obstacles its hard to make it nowadays
Whys the Devil winnin Some say its our fault
If thats the answer you know smokin cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin cause thats how they rewind
Yall know how we dine we dont eat swine
And we dont drink wine
If you dont bring me some motherfuckin cognac Ill kill you
I cant feel you aint in my senses and you aint in my dollars
I fuck with rottweilers no leashes no collars brolic scholars
Thats Ghost Deini
