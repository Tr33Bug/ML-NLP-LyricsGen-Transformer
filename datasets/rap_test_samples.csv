3516,"This life shit this life shit is like
Is like bugged the fuck out son for real
See to live is to suffer
But to survive
Well thats to find meaning in the suffering
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ive been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If Im strong enough Ill live long enough to see my kids
Doing something more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there now Im in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit so I split and said that Ima
Be that seed that doesnt need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesnt bleed
Im ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Bagging niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Goin too fast it wouldnt last but yo I couldnt tell
Group homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcing me to be a man
When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand
Damn was it my fault something I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than Id ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
Thats my only mothafucka I hit off with my last
Just another lil nigga headed nowhere fast
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
That aint the half shit gets worse as I get older
Actions become bolder heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didnt need a clique cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin shit for kicks
Catchin vics throwin bricks gettin by bein slick
Used to get high just to get by
Used to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly
Ate somethin a couple of forties made me hate somethin
I did some coke now Im ready to take somethin
Three years later showin signs of stress
Didnt keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
Im possessed by the darker side livin the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but Im fuckin it up
Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Wasnt long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin shit like Damn look how that rock got him
Open like a window no more indo
Look at a video sayin to myself That coulda been yo
Ass on the TV believe me it could be done
Somethins got to give gots to change cause now Ive got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin high drinkin 40s
So I get back lookin type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong kept a nigga from doin wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is your fuckin song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit youll get yours because its due
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
See this is that shit this is that shit
That all real niggas can relate to
This is from the heart baby
Dont get it twisted
X baby

For your mantle damn you too hard to handle
EDouble slam once and Redman slam two
Break hooks earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords

Niggas be thinkin Im deep intelligent fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average theresâaâyoung lady outâthere she way smarter than me
Iâscrolled through her timeline in these wild times and Iâstartedâtoâread
She mad atâthese crackers sheâmad at these capitalists mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas she mad at our ignorance she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities lowkey I be thinkin she talkin bout me
Now I aint no dummy to think Im above criticism
So when I see something thats valid I listen
But shit its something about the queen tone thats botherin me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts em
And the clearest understandin of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people dont see
Just cause you woke and Im not that shit aint no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon lead when you attackin the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin
Instead of conveyin you holier come help us get up to speed
Shit its a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees cant grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe
Im on some Fuck a retweet most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon reach
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say its more effective to treat people like children
Understandin the time and love and patience thats needed to grow
This change is inevitable but aint none of us seen this before
Therefore we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin just maybe in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like Im some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros thats next to the commas
But look here I promise Im not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like Wait
He was like Cole preciate what you been doin my nigga thats real
But damn why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff
Well maybe cause deep down I know I aint doin enough
The sun is shinin today
The sun is shinin today
The sun is shinin today
Can you walk with me
I hope well find the reason why we often sob go on cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child Ive gotten older
Still I know Im just a boy in Gods eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive help mine thrive

Now thats some Bullshit
A lot of rappers talk a lot of beef
Got gats wit full clips
Balls bout as big as those RockyMountainOysters
You Aint sayin nothin just makin a lot of noises
They aint tougher than leather you gots to keep steppin
In videos
Look at the rumps
On these heifers
Young tenderloins
Gotta skin their hides
For the meal ticket
Xzibit can Pimp dey rides
What the USDA say
Grade A Prime
So thats a primetime slot
Just to say they shine
For the 30 seconds of fame
You cant resist
But seven days in your colon and you still aint sht
VERSE 2
Its waay too many lives at steak stake 
YES SIR NO SIRloin
The soldier say
He supposed to be the Macho Man
See you holdin on to some Beef Jerkey knock it out yo hand
Cookin in a foreign land
Watch the beef stew
The women and the Children on the ground
Thats beef too
And both sides claim God missing the focus
Cuz one say Halal
The other say Kosher
They Both hate pigs
Love Abraham
And Moses
So why we see commandments broken
Moses talked to God on the mountain
When he came back down
The people started worshipping cash cows
Today we got the USDA
Trynna leave their mark
Its all politics
Slaughterhouseschop those parts
Now ANY grade less
Than the USSelect
Still serve you that beef
But did you know it was Processed
VERSE 3
America consume mo beef
Than every country on the earth
Even toddlers Obese
A quarter pound burger you can pick on the Menu
Some people dont like it rare 
Forbidden to Hindus
And vegetarians wont be beefin against you
The same category
Pork chicken and fish too
Get all their Protien from Soy Rice and Beans
Now these vegans on another level
Rebel to Ice Cream
It might seem crazy but the flow dont stop
Hippies say they dont need roast
To smoke no pot
Now da USDA say recall that beef
Cuz the COW was MAD
But the farmers keep fillinem up
We keep killin for what
Meatgrillin
The Beef keep sizzlin
Mike was a Bull Now we got King james
Some n99z dont like Kobe but he still got game
Who want Beef

2566,"Back in the days was kinda crazy kid I started out with nothin
Wasnt livin like Thanksgiving I was turkey without the stuffin
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the po house
Say mama caught the drama she would bleed tryin to feed fo mouths
Wasnt rockin Girbauds I barely had clothes and when it snow
And temperatures droppin below zero you know I froze
No CDs a black and white TV I see thats about to retire
With a hanger for the antenna turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin in my cabinet but cans of Raid
Im knockin on my neighbors door to borrow a cup of sugar for my KoolAid
I wasnt freshly dipped my gear was straight ripped
Im trippin cause my winter coat got lost buttons and zippers that wouldnt stay zipped
I never remembered a dinner the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black I had KitKats on top of Cracker Jacks
Walkin the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldnt speak I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin humped from the stunts I always struck out
The one you like says take a hike if you cant pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines you know what Im sayin

Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines yeah
It seems like only yesterday my moms is on my back
Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack
Black I dont disown her Im just a kid from Corona
With a GED diploma with more ribs showin than Tony Romas
In order to get straight I gots to to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin down on the corner slangin fat rocks to bottles with the black tops
For cops got my shorty watchin my back hops
Makin mad lucci bought up Louis Vuitton Gucci
Hoochies callin me boochi while they smooch me givin up the coochie
Now Im a felon started sellin and splittin melons
Some started jellin and tellin police just cause I was swellin
Hangin out on the corner playin ceelo rollin for half a kilo
Yo youll never see G low or goin below
Yeah straight gettin fortunate as long as fiends was torchin it
It started gettin hot around the block the cops was scorchin it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
This business in drugs is gettin too risky
So now I just lamp collect stamps snatch tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines you know what Im sayin

Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines yeah
I got put on by DJ Polo cut the record Its a Demo
And started chillin in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin no time for pains sportin gold chains and rings
Clockin money and fame nothin changed Im still the same
Just spendin twenties and tens at women pullin on my linen
Then grinnin cause I was winnin in this game from the beginnin
The lyrical skills was kinda ill gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build known for rappers run and go write wills
And turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low now I puff on cigars and blow Os
So catch a flashback of a G Rap track attacked like a head crack
Get smacked through your cap with the lead black
And heres a new cut for poobutt rappers hangin from off my two nuts
Like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G Rap dont sleep money unless its with ya girl
Straight up kid Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines

Run they amp shit plant shit destroy evidence

Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks

Curve swerve and get served these cocksuckers got nerve

Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run fuck that run cops got guns

Clear twelvetwelves that look like stuffed shells
Im cutting niggas throats on the sales while they puff Ls
Dont leave nothing unbagged shave everything
I learned from the OGs to save everything
They come by one more time they gon hop out
They two deep and one is a bitch she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing so Im dippin with that uh
Downshifting on em like I got gears on me
Besides that I got about five years on me Run 
Scared to death running like I got bears on me Run 
My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me Run 
Its hard for me to slow down its like Im on the Thruway
My belts in the crib on the floor by my twoway
Now Im trying to hold my hammer up and my pants too
If they dont kill me they gon give me a number I cant do
Rather it be the streets than jail where I die at
And Im asthmatic so Im looking for somewhere to hide at
But they too close and I got this new toast
Imagine if I wouldve let off a shot or two you know what I gotta do
Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run fuck that run cops got guns
They givin out life like by the tons
Run if you aint do shit you it
That next felony nigga is life threezip
So run hop fences jump over benches

A rebel born from verbal holocaust
Dirty and never try to cleanse to get the drama off
Swiftest stealth assassin snipe you from balcony shots
A terrorist position professional from the opera box
Rhyme documents infamous like the Bill of Rights
Illa tight havin niggas open like the thrill of dykes
Jean Grae Yakuza mass murderer
Friends who got the dirt on her
Foes who never heard of her
Wild Style my mouth bomb the train up
I spit Krylon in five colors when I speak I spray my name up
Split your wig up like Denny Bruce
Splash your remains and brains out
On the street like Henny and juice
Noose your neck and loosen your spine from back
Shift your spleen rip til its just obscene
From downtown swingin it New York illest who rip it
Ever flow like a river fuck your girl like a nigga what
Ive been through hell and back scars swell on my back
I spit bars yall spit repetitive raps
Im a street dude who decided to rhyme with lines thatll crack the disc between your mind and your spine
Thats why yall wanna bite my design
And thats why usually I hold the mic like a 9
Pistolwhip you on the side of your eye watch it pop out
We knock out cats and wipe the floors with their rocks out
Shocked now Like you drivin in a lightning storm
With the top down we got this locked down
Like convicts on the run gettin shot down for phone time
We gainin yards in the whole nine
See me and Tech we steadily building
And we about to blow like the Oklahoma Federal Building
And all them niggas get mad when we step in the building Cause we make the crowd jump
And hit they head on the ceiling what
I spit heat like the deserts of Saudi Arabia
Bury competition like Mesopotamia
Emanatin radiation pissin liquid uranium
I bring the rock like European drunks in soccer stadiums
Ill split your cranium with perfect symmetry lyrically
If youre not the illest then you dont deserve to spit with me
OBSobliterating bastards sacrilegiously
I sacrifice niggas who talk shit ritualistically
Meticulously makin all my rivals suicidal
Like white suburban kids on acid readin the Satanic Bible
My arrival is genocidal like Christopher Columbus
Exterminatin races of wack MCs that walk among us
Ive just begun to bust Ill make this place open candela
These racist cops wanna lock me longer then Nelson Mandela
Pissed off Im makin hella paper East to West Coast
And I treat the law in this country like a motherfuckin joke
Cause if Im willin to smoke the President
While hes sniffin his coke
You know it dont mean shit to me to cut a fuckin cops throat

298,"Crenshaw and Slauson True Story LyricsPART 1
Look relate to you I cant if yous a fake nigga
Where Level 4 in the state what your mistakes get you
Rap niggas they just wanna double date with you
Twitpic and show these hoes that they affiliate with you
Labels used to treatin rappers like a slave nigga
Starvin artist Just be happy with your fame nigga
Shit changed now its such a different game
All the niggas like myself is controlling everything
If you pay attention see exactly what I mean
Fuck the middleman I said that in 2003
Was 18 White Lincoln chrome feet
Black 40 was my pillow every night I go to sleep
Grown niggas treat me like they OG
Holdin on to every word that the tiny loc speaks
I had a vision that nobody else could see
Sold my shit to DMac a little less than 10 Gs
Brought my grocery bag of cash back to Blacc Sam
He matched a nigga next day we went to Sam Ash
We bought a Pro Tools and a microphone
Studio was far from plush but them lights was on
Couple hunned thousand stashed at my mamas home
Real estate in Atlanta but aint nobody know
Mac 11s in the safe hidden in the floor
My bro did it like nobody that Ive ever known
Screens on every wall with 16 camera angles
Double pane bulletproof glass pushin past the haters
Cuban links and Rolexes fold a check from Epic
This industry aint gotta like us but they gon respect it
Built the label up from money we was savin up
No details til the statute of limitations up
Couple niggas got flipped tryna play with us
The demonstrations speak loud so I aint sayin much
Was a charismatic nigga I dont play as much
Cause life is real when you live it in a place like us
School pictures crackin smiles now my face is stuck
Shell shocked to see how much they really hated us
Couldnt keep a kind heart get yo hatred up
Streets smarts nigga get yo information up
Watching Belly smokin blunts take Jamaican puffs
One day Ima have a house and car like Jamaican cuz
Credits roll back to stress pound breakin up
Had to fight before we hustled and it made us tough
Early 90s neighbors rooster used to wake us up
Mama had a bucket and a shack but we aint make a fuss
Blue Cutlass no license 380 tucked
96 Caprice Bolt Da Fatts was savin up
They gettin packed out if niggas try fade with us
Crenshaw and Slauson True Story Zo play the drums
PART 2
I got to this paper no industry favors
Speaking to they soul so they tell me Im they favorite
Been through it myself yeah I know how it make you
Never let em judge you cuz they aint you
I could tell a long story or just say Im grateful
I could tell a gang of reasons or just say Im faithful
I can sell a million records or just mixtape it
They dont really give a fuck long as I just keep pacing
Quiet for a year gave no explanation
Now Im bout to drop I got em on that Proud 2 Pay shit
Half of a million cash he gon offer me a label
Told him that I need to own it so Im cool kept it gangster
Holla back real niggas what you calling that
You see the game fucked up look what part is that
They compare where Im at to where I started at
They put me in the Getty Im a artifact
They cant never hang me on the wall though
We presidents nigga we push buttons
The rest of yall just react
Victory Lap nigga this Marathon
Still dont stop though
Count me up count me up
Im in this shit you niggas is out as fuck
Im used to people doubting Id amount to much
I thrive off the challenge Im a childish fuck
I love toys so Im by the buck
I hate to lose so I play too rough
I speak my mind and say I say too much
Minus the hiphop cops say I dont say enough
I know they listening to my raps
While Im out running these laps
Tryna make my paper stack
Its like this and like that
I think Im KRS
I think Im dead prez
I think Im 2Pac nigga I need some fuckin meds
I think Im Eminem Im going crazy
Shoot in front of the shop Nas AZ
I never planned to make it to a old nigga
Plant the bag 560 off a zone nigga
Dip my Giovanni feet in chrome nigga
Drop them bitches on Pirellis hit the road with em
I should get the cover of the Rolling Stone nigga
I should perform at the Old Republic or Rome nigga
Im not a rapper or a poet Im a poem nigga
Aint it amazing how Im standing on my own nigga
Always pull up in foreign thats never loaned nigga
Always speaking my music straight from my soul nigga
My business partners Jewish but Im all nigga
Still ghetto that aint wrong is it
Way I see it long as I ball nigga
Im a California don nigga
Hundred thousand on my car nigga
You know very well who you are nigga
PART 3
I been that nigga before the fame happened
That tell them hoes go get my name tatted
I rock a Roley cause my game classic
And repped LA before it came back in
I know yall see me in my lane smashin
I know yall hate me with a strange passion
I made examples out yall lame asses
I love my life yall could hate that shit
All the smart money got they bets on me
And all them real niggas wish the best for me
All these bad bitches got some sex for me
Shout out them bad bitches getting dressed for me
They down to stand in line cause its well worth it
Pull up to my shows in Chanel purses
They jeans fit the worst but they smell perfect
Never argue with they niggas but they yell verses
Ay Im true to this game
Gimme that pussy fore she tell me her name
Ay Im true to this game
All Money In No Money Out on my chain
Ay Im true to this game
No guarantees you gotta live for today

We still them same niggas that we used to be
Blacc Sam in that sedan in the coupe is me
Hundred thousand for the car so the roof was free
While Im in it flashback on how it used to be
Wildin nigga cant relax it was the youth of me
That make a smoker buy the bullets for a shooting spree
Found myself same time family losing me
But all that violence from the past is what produced a G
All the real LA niggas know the truth is me
No hotline homie I could tell your future free
Get on your Marathon til you bruise ya feet
Or run the streets til the reverend write ya eulogy
Fishbowl in the six with all my jewelry
Cause I heard my haters is supposed to be shooting me
Ill never let a broke bitch influence me
Slauson Ave getting money and the proof is me
Cause I tell everybody all the time
Own your masters own your catalog
Cant none of these niggas say they own their masters and their catalog
If they do theyre lying to you
Or they gon say own some of it or they gon buy it back
All that is bullshit
Just had to get our little thing together
We picked up distribution
Now were strong now were legit nawmean
And were a force to be reckoned with right now word up

3382,"Upon initial contact with IceTs music I had envisioned him to be an illmannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon shocking sexual audacity and repulsive images of the ghetto
However after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle
But to make things more plain and simple to the layman I find IceT to be the dopest flyest OG pimp hustler gangster player hardcore motherfucker living today
To be honest Im totally and completely on his dick

The pimps gon rule the nation in 93
And MJG is gonna start a new race

And chase that live on cops quick out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the nic comin on
So open the Crown down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what Im sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggas be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin aint dead yet the pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you aint shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But its time to switch it up unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it complete it and pick it up

We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now Im runnin thangs my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game thangs are bound to show

Up steps the one and only in the flesh
Senegalese Sierra Leonian fresh to death
Big homie and them reps the best
Knew you knew me from somewhere
I get wrecked with Questlover
The brother get it on bring a song
More brutal than Genghis Khan
Whose name ring alarms to fakes
You couldnt place but know Im the truth
Thats before you recognize its the one from The Roots
Armed to the tooth trying got take an eye for another eye
Im from we hear gunfire for a lullaby
Yo forget it who the hell am I
Yo Im the reason these MCs lives became nullified
The stuff of legend so tell me whats tougher brethren
Well Im the blast form the past that started the present
Vision of the future me and the super producer
And Im ten times as smart as Im used to being
Im still seeing the voice through the speakers
Porsche two seaters Jimmy Choo sneakers
Real rap remedy man a true genius
I brought Yosemite Sam two heaters
Asking these bastards if its any last word
Besides what when why and all them adverbs
You bout to be the next fugitive captured
Just keep thinking you can lie and live after
Slow your roll playboy rabbit ears
Cause damn right its on sight like Vladimir
And by the moment of time you will be out of here
Scrap get slapped for acting so cavalier
Im from Philly and them cabbers dont travel there
Brothers let the heat rattle there
They dont battle there
Itching to leave you in the pool like Mike Phelps
Learning to fight might help but thats light help
Cause the bullets make flak melt
Then just imagine what itd do to you even if you a black belt
Ayo my brother still concealing with a gat held
On a block where there used to be a lot of crack dealt
Lo and behold this is information overload
I put the crowd in a trance like Paul Oakenfold
I used to be the lowest on the totem pole
Until I reconstructed my goals left a broken mold
Setting sights on the open road
I hit them anywhere and everywhere the realness is bought and sold
Ayo they got me on the honor role
That mean whenever speaking my name
Begin that with The Honorable
TAR one I like a monocle
I bring the riot to a laugh cause you comical
Look get in that ass like your father do
Hit that catatonic chronic out in Bonnaroo
Im psychological jump like Geronimo
Probably get yourself knocked down like a domino
Whoa if I dont work then I wont eat
No I dont Facebook but I might Tweet
The industry is out of control like OC
So take this L on the chin like its a goatee
Im kinda like a cellar door lowkey
I used to mix bottles of champagne with OE
Im Aristotle I cant fail Im OG
I came through to get free like no fee
Ayo they got me on the pedestal trophy
Got them singing Damn Riq cheating like adultery
Sycamore sitting on paper like upholstery
Noam Chomsky Im on an organized rhyme spree
Messing with this is borderline robbery
And thats what it is im jimbrowski
Certain circles call me the Big Lebowski
It would behoove you to find out about me
Agh ahhhh Whoa hohoho
You whack rappers better step your game up
Wow give it up for Black Thought one of the greatest of all time
Man man man man Man dude
I dont know if any dude got anymore lyrics than this dude right here
The Roots are here we celebrating the release of their new album and then you shoot your cousin

871,"You are now witnessing the demise of the music business
I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what Im saying
I cant do music with people Im uncomfortable with
You know what Im saying
I cant be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I dont like you
So with that said shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
Thats my Blacksmith family you dig
I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah those was the salad days my careers appetizer
The main course a casserole a jambalaya
Of different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers tutelage
Paying for college not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this was
Hard to tell my parents sat them down tried to get through to them
Started flowing daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubix and Juju on Flatbush my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus whats up Jarret and Brian Blackshaw
And Matt Fingaz Kendra Ross you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with HiTek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smyth shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots they played so well
Writing rhymes with Myka 9
Me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in common
Mystik Journeymen introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Aint no mountain high enough for him he never stopped climbing
Thats why when the homies win I never stop smiling
See Im smiling right now
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt thats how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the God in me
Friends and family yup they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family thats right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up its like you all my fam
Friends and family like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
It started with a blast now Im a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl your mother never far away
This is for Eque this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
HeadCquarterz and Guru is love forever yall
Make it plain cause its too strong for a metaphor or simile
Your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Til the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad you could have done worse
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt thats how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the God in me
Friends and family yup they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family thats right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up its like you all my fam
Friends and family like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
First record was with Mood back in 96
In fact it was pretty fresh Google that find that shit
It sound good I was showing you what timeless is
You couldnt catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and Manifesto
So much wack rap I know its hard to tell the difference
But when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
Im resurrected but Im no savior
I know the game I can ball a little bit Im an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered
We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
To snap back like the jaws of gators

Ya know
Yeah
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk and the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too like Attack of the Clones
Work til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bones
To get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while your egos spread rumors
We survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
Ask Him why some people gotta live in a trailer cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth they hot like the jail cell in the south
Before my nigga Cor bailed me out
To get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
We do or die like BedStuy
See the red sky out the window of the redeye
Let the lead fly on some G Rap shit livin to let die
Now this morning I woke up
Feelin brand new I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows and my soul
And my goals just to stop smokin and stop drinkin
And Ive been thinkin Ive got my reasons
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by

Just to get by hey hey
We keep it gangsta say fo shizzle fo sheezy and stay crunk
Its easy to pull a breezy smoke trees and we stay drunk
Yo our activism attackin the system the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen they victims lackin the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let em know we missin you the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal I aint bullshittin you
Now why would I lie Just to get by
Just to get by we get fly
The TV got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars
The ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin to rely on we get high on all types of drug
When all you really need is love
To get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop what
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows and my soul
And my goals just to stop smokin and stop drinkin
And Ive been thinkin Ive got my reasons
Just to get by just to get by
Just to get by just to get by
Yoyoyo yo yo
Some people cry and some people try
Just to get by for a piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high we deceive and we lie
And we keepin it fly yyyyo yo
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Cant see they eyes see the evil inside
But theres people you find strong or feeble in mind
I stay readin the signs yyyyo yo yo
Some people cry and some people try

2611,"I was up and out my mothers house at 17
Been a grown ass married man ever since
Family reunions Im talked about but never seen
Cause I learned that some of them can be your nemesis
Got a lot of scars on me Ill now tell you the stories
If you promise not to take offense
Homie sit back then Ant bring the beat in
Ill try to find a place that starts to make sense now
The first time I was pushed out blind
Cold and naked spanked on the ass to breathe
An immigrant from heaven on earth with the work visa
I announce my self with gasps and screams
Before blighted white supremacy heisted my innocence
I was living out life behind the picket fence
Happy go lucky scared of no one
With the only exception Im allergic to the sun
Didnt know I had a image that a camera couldnt capture
100 Allahs manufacture
But then came the laughter and outside Im battered
Picket fence shattered
I saw my self as bastard tagalong harassed and spat upon
By the children of slave masters who passed it on
The saddest songs been sung at the hands of who I call the race from hell
Its a disgrace from hell
Fell face first in the self hate
Burst into tears when I hear my own hellish name cursed
If I seem timid its only because every mirror that I saw back then had the
Earths ugliest human being in it
And with that said they would kick me till they got tired or I act dead
And I have to tell yall that the obvious part
That I always feel free when Im talking to god
Alone on the playground Friday afternoon
And the old sister who hums gospel tunes
I saw her notice getting closer
She approached me and put a knowing hand on my shoulder
And booked my feelings
Cause she looked at me in a way that adults very seldom look at children
And with the wisdom only earned by years
She read my thoughts and she welled up with tears and said
You look the way you do because youre special
Not the short bus way I mean that Gods gonna test you
And all of this pain is training for the day when you
Will have to lead with the gift God gave to you
Grown folks dont see it but the babies do
And theres a chance that you can save a few
And time will prove that she started my movement
She didnt tell me to take it she told me to use it
The second time poppa ripped the womb open early
And exposed me to the coldness of life prematurely
Where moms love used to live now housed denial
And when that decayed it made it bitter and spiteful
But me and my runaway we share something special
Rode into the sunset can barely touch the pedals
No strings attached screaming fuck Geppetto
We may live in the gutter but we cling to each other
A week before my son came I caught a bad bounce
And had to step to mom with my hands out
And momma proved the two of us could not live in that house
She lied to the police so they would throw us in the streets
And separating from you is something that I feel I must do
Its not that I dont love you its more that I dont trust you
Its been a year since Ive seen a living relative
And its just now that Im starting to live
But while Im sitting here choking on tears wishing that I didnt care
Feeling all alone in this hemisphere I swear upon everything I hold dear
And then my wife comes near and I hear a voice whisper in my ear
Youre going through all of this because youre special
Not no superstar shit I mean that God had to test you
And all of this pain has been training for the day when you
Would lead us with the gift God gave to you
Your parents might not see it but your babies do
And theres a chance that you can save a few
And time will prove that she started my movement
She didnt tell me to take it she told me to use it
So I use it

Throw the fork on it then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it got it flying out of Dallas

Hope you didnt throw away what we established
Hope you wouldnt turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look round here theyll back stab you
Word from your motherfucking brother young nigga

Yeah we good now
Turn the vocals down a little bit just a little bit
I want it loud
Heres my moment of clarity
Ive been misleadin you all givin you half of me
Ive been blazin a trail and leavin casualties
Ive diagnosed myself I think its apathy
So lettin go became easy grabbin ahold thats the hardest
I know our expiration date soon as we start it
You come around and you feel safe while youre a target
You feelin like I let you inside while Im guarded
Its genius when arrogance seems like its modest
Look past the insanity glance at the logic
Appears optional all of it is stipulated
Watch and learn how emotions get manipulated
Now you in dire need of help
You the victim made to think you did it to yourself
Speakin of rest in peace Sandra Bland
Me Im believin everything that wasnt on that cam
But back to you beauty let me address our lil movement
You in therapy but I dont see the improvement
Oh whatevers been made now days is ruined
So every few months I ponder what the fuck are we doin
Let me watch my words again
You easily got one of the best pussies that Ive ever been inserted in
You real kind real sweet real nurturin
Yet every time we link back up you just get hurt again
You put all men in a box I aint one of em
Funny how you got all the answers and none of em
You only dated three men so Im scared of you
Cause with no point of reference what the fuck are you comparin to
You good one minute psycho the next
No longer lettin it ride too much Jekyll and Hyde
Then you subtweet for weeks busy settin your pride
Im grown dont really need that sort of mess in my life
But wait you of age you old too
I control my emotions yours control you
You bright enough to know when you get impulsive
For me thats repulsive how do you not know this
And then we go our separate ways
Just to link back on better days
Though I know its short term and you never stay
You always a sucker for that text that say
Yo what up Are you good
Hit me up whenever you in the hood
Then we fuck and its fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
Im waitin for you to talk but you wont
Then you wait for me to react but I dont
Then you go and I watch
We know how this movie go but we watch
Cause we just playin our parts
Youre watchin how I perform and its breakin your heart
You home alone backtrackin replayin the start
You realize this whole script youve been playin a mark
That aint stop you from takin a part
I guess were both just playin our parts
Yeah and so the pussy aint enough now
They keep thinkin it should be enough how
Fuck sex baby later for that
This mind game Im playin is a greater climax
Not a franchise player I cant pay you the max
I cant say it to you so I just say it in raps
I got a rep that I made all by myself
One I hate all by myself
That comes from decisions created all by myself
I cant shake it all by myself
See I grew up in the spotlight
Where your every move is eyed
The truth becomes lies when youre that scrutinized
No mentorship I was unsupervised
Had to learn on my own every rule to survive
Still I manned up in caught those wrongs
Go ahead and judge Joe I got my court clothes on
Yall see the front behind the scenes more goes on
Check my back catalog its in all those songs forreal
So I can be at peace forever
I left the puzzle right there nigga piece it together
But back to you beauty small waist fat booty
Its cool for the moment but dont permanently move me
They come through tossin me ass like its their duty
But who I was aint who I am I say it truly
Here I am shootin em down without the Uzi
Unlike them niggas you know dont try and group me
Watched myself on TV was unruly
How the fuck they cast me wrong in my own movie
They say you are what you attract
Here I am screamin fuck all that
Then Im forced to believe I attract and adore
Bunch of unstable broads with character flaws
With plenty luggage I greet em with their bags at the door
If thats true then its some shit Id rather ignore
Cause check it whatever helps you get by
So when they hit me I always reply
They always be like whats up Are you good
Hit me up whenever you in the hood
Then we fuck and its fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
Im waitin for you to talk but you wont
Then you wait for me to react but I dont
Then you go and I watch
We know how this movie go but we watch
Cause we just playin our parts
Youre watchin how I perform and its breakin your heart
You home alone backtrackin replayin the start
Realize this whole script youve been playin a mark
But that aint stop you from takin a part
I guess were both just playin our parts
Just where Im at lately
Look at the monster this industry done made me
Shit I loved the most I let it jade me
Cryin out for help somebody save me
But I cant let em know all that
They take it as weakness when you show all that
So I just live in my mind til this hoe call back
Every time Im knocked down you see Joe crawl back forreal
Nowadays they all the same
Enhanced body parts smaller brains
They dont get a hi in fact
Mums the word baby girl its now quiet for that forreal
If you got nothin to offer
Sorry Mrs Jackson gotta off ya
But as soon as you leave em alone
Its when they send that same text to the phone
They always be like whats up Are you good
Hit me up whenever you in the hood
Then we fuck and its fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
Im waitin for you to talk but you wont
You wait for me to react but I dont
Then you go and I watch
We know how this movie go but we watch
Cause we just playin our parts
I guess were both just playin our parts
I play mine well
Better than you
And it go baby baby

185,"Yo I had to reinvent I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents man I been competin since
I look beyond what people sayin and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights cherish these people
Life is a movie but therell never be a sequel
And Im good with that as long as Im peaceful
As long as seven years from now Im takin my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days man do they go quick
Just yesterday I swear it was 06
Ten years ago thats when you proposed
I looked down Yes I suppose
All things go all things go
All things go all things go
I feel one minute yeah we got it then its gone
While we keep waitin for a moment to live for
So cant nobody ever tell me that Im wrong
Cause Ima ride out wit you still the night is young
And we keep goin we go We go we go 
We wake back up and do it all again And we know we know 
Said Fuck the world we ridin til the end
When all is said and done look what weve become Oh we go 
I just want you to know that I did it for you
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me but I didnt invite him
Why didnt he ask Or am I just buggin
Cause since I got fame they dont act the same
Even though they know that I love em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him he aint even call me
And thats the reflection of me
Yes I get it I get it was all me
Ill pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me
All things go all things go
All things go all things go
I feel one minute yeah we got it then its gone
While we keep waitin for a moment to live for
So cant nobody ever tell me that Im wrong
Cause Ima ride out wit you still the night is young
And we keep goin we go We go we go 
We wake back up and do it all again And we know we know 
Said Fuck the world we ridin til the end
When all is said and done look what weve become Oh we go 
I just want you to know that I did it for you
Lemme make this clear Im not difficult Im just bout my business
Im not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and thats a fact
Id give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why Im so overprotective
The more I work the more I feel like somehow theyre neglected
I want Caiah to go to college just to say We did it
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like Caiah is the both of them
Its like hes Caiahs little angel lookin over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and Ill always love him
And Im just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when Im around him
Gee we did it lets leave this imprint
Just finished writin this is The Pinkprint
All things go all things go
All things go all things go

543,"Imagine 20 years with a bitter bitch and the same drama
Dame told you do this shit and you dont see Dame karma
K9 on your ass nigga no distraction
Pussy nigga wearin pink I guess he think he matchin
Ima paint the picture let the niggas make the caption
Fuck bars Im tell nigga what really happened
You hear this tone you know the mac is in my seat
You see exactly what I see you know my rap is not for free
You sent them pussy niggas to the hill to trap me in the V
You singing nigga aint gonna be no back up bitch with me
I chew that nigga til my teeth hurt dont even hit the weed first
Bitches used to say Im blessed and I didnt even sneeze first
Much dirt as I got on you dont even need no research
My hand filthy heart guilty niggas like me need church
Tax know you as the nigga that snitched on the Roc
DC crips only know you the nigga they shot
OG niggas dont have no history with you on the block
And everybody seen the footage I got
Every since 10 you was a thirsty nigga
I aint gone talk about the time you fucked your sister
In 2002 you lost 50 pounds ulcers in your liver
And now you tryna sell niggas liquor nigga
You always play the sucker part
Where was all that Rico shit when you left Jim in Rucker Park
Matter fact Im on a true life change
But lets get back to that smack and that Tru Life chain
Damn bro
Damn the whole fuckin land know
After that 50 shit you moved to Orlando
You had the nigga Jim on the radio where did Cam go
We all understand though
You not really built for this shit
You not ready to kill for this shit
But no regrets
You gotta lift up a TEC to get Murder respect
Nigga are UN you dipped on the set
Im the fuckin cough in the slime flu
You gone out rhyme who Im your prime times 2
I never paid for my mistakes cause thats not what crime do
Bitches fuck me but thats what dimes do
Somebody wanna jump in tell em come share
Im starting to feel like we dont really compare
Im pretty nigga wrist litty sun wear
Diplomat only mean that you aint from here
You had a run here but yall niggas is done here
All these pretty women and yall niggas bringin guns here
You way past the gun line
Every time you talk of me you sound like one time
I fuck the King of rap bitch when I was unsign
And made the nigga Diddy sign me off of one line
Dont blame for the past and I wont blame you for the crash
Sent my nigga Huddy on a dummy mission and he crashed
Gilet I know you need money I get it
I know your digital sales I know about your digits
I know Sony Red didnt wanna your shit distribute
I know its crickets so fuck it use my name so they can click it
I made you I raised you why would I play you
When you dealing with this power nigga Flex cant save you
Me amorin drive the foreign kick the door in
Lady treat me like him important
I dont even think of scoring
I just run the floor and D could alleyoop it to me like in Boston
On some Kyrie shit yall just talking
Heard that often
Had to rap again yall was boring em
Now you can tell Dave East AAP Mob whatever you want
The whole hood know Im the origin
You robbed Juelz on some Diddy shit
And when Jim start ballin you get back on sissy shit
You even had the nerve to call up Sham
And use his basketball skill to steal the name Jelly Fam
Damn Cam I thought more of you
But when I think about it thats really all you do
You really not that fly
You really not that guy
You really not that wise
Im really not surprised
All pride aside you try to pay Lodi moms to side with your lies
Now Im like fuck it Drago if he dies he dies
Aint no unity
Aint no Children of the Corn
Aint no you and me
Any nigga ever got Diplomat Immunity
Was niggas who ratted or ones who snitched on their community
And thats word to my nigga Big L
To my nigga fucking Trell and to that nigga Bigavel
To nigga Loon on all my niggas in the cell
Hope you hold ya head I hope yall niggas doing well
This Mae nigga I invented the curve
Im the name on the ribbon on the bird

Seen many things
And they in color too
Seen women so beautiful
That I could die with a smile on my face
And not feel like the good lord gypped me
The space between love and me
Between 
How you expect to have an ordinary relationship with such an
Extraordinary nigga yeah theres flaws in what you figured
Aint the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her

Wrappin one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book coming to life when Im
Flipping through the pictures switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and Im loving the way you sound
And Im smothering and Im grindin now doubt is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and up against the cupboard till we

When you see it from this angle the color the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down thats the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase go off the grid for a
Few days go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity
In a world of respect and Im trading it like its currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella Im wishin his fella right his wrong
But naw instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My lightll poke through the clouds well take you higher like you
Smoking the loud while I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears you can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yea

You dont look like turquoise
You dont look like gold
You dont look like purple
Thatll match your hue

2534,"This is it dope from the fly kid
The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers youve lost cause players youre not gangstas you aint
Youre faintin punk if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo the pusher the player the pimp gangsta the hustler
High Roller dead pres folder
Is cold lampin like a black king on a throne
Evil Eturn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin tape
Another album to make Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his lac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science Youre dumb
Stupid ignorant dont even talk to me
At school you dropped Math Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing you got heart
To perpetrate youre bait so just wait
Till the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now why not
You start to sweat and fret it gets hot
Howd you get into this spot
You played yourself
Yo yo you played yourself
Im no authority but I know the DEAL
When it comes to dealin with the females
What you got they want cash is what they need
Slip sucker and theyll break you with speed
But you meet a freak you try to turn her out
Spendin moneys what Im talkin about
But you fool out your pockets got blew out
And after the date no boots you got threw out
Mad and shook cause your ducats got took
Call her up phones off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip
You cant buy no relationship
You played yourself
Yo homeboy you played yourself
Im in the MC game a lot of MCs front
And for the money theyre sell out stunts
But they claim that theyre rich and that they keep cash
Yo let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin bout gold
You better double that then double that again
And still dont get souped my friend
You think youve made it youre just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny fans
But you diss em cause you think youre a star
That attitude is rude you wont get far
Cause theyll turn on you quick youll drop like a brick
Unemployments where youll sit
No friends cause you dissed em too
No money no crew youre through
You played yourself
Thats right you played yourself
You played yourself
Yo yo you played yourself
You got problems you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take
Straight to the Dopeman try to get a beam up
Your idle time is spent trying to scheme up
Another way to get money for a jumbo
When you go to sleep you count FiveOs
Lyin and cheatin everybody youre beatin
Dirty clothes and youre skinny cause you havent been eatin
You ripped off all your family and your friends
Nowhere does your larceny end
And then you get an idea for a big move
An armed robberysmooth
But everything went wrong somebody got shot
You couldnt get away the cops roll youre popped
And now youre locked yo lampin on Death Row
Societys fault No
Nobody put the crack into the pipe
Nobody made you smoke off your life
You thought that you could do dope and still stay cool Fool
You played yourself
You played yourself
Aint nobody elses fault you played yourself

2841,"Yeah Thats the beat right there
Im about to black out
With a hundred bars on some professional shit
So dont try this at home yo
Yo yo yo
My style of rhymin is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans
Because I recognize its all about timin
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin African voodoo science
In front of twentyfoot bonfires
Lookin skyward calculatin May 5 2000
The nine planetsll be in alignment
The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit
Of a starship the size of the HaleBopp comet
With mercury ion rockets
And a bigass Canibus Comin Soon poster on the side of it
Im known geographically and intergalactically
Thats why I got extraterrestrials that wanna battle me
They even tried kidnappin me and they wouldve snatched me
If their craft didnt get trapped in the Earths gravity
Engines stalled and failed crashed into a farmers field
And thats really what caused Roswell
Undercover operatives workin for COM 12
Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal
Lyrically Im offscale so all hail
Or get tossed towards Hell whatever yall feel
Bruisin niggas confusin niggas like Chip Fu from the FuSchnickens
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles
Hear the wild wolf growl
Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds
Wack niggas wanna be down but its not allowed
Interrupt the cipher unannounced
And youll get punched in the mouth
With the southpaw southern fist
Ill bust your shit swell your lip bigger than Bubba Shrimp
For actin tough and shit what a wimp
You giant Goliath niggas get shot with a rubber sling
Im an experiment gone bad
My brainwaves on an encephalograph
Show that Im stark ravin mad
Your whole scientific staffll get killed in a nuclear blast
When I throw the Florence flask in my hand
Flammable liquids in the lab explode
And you get stabbed with all the flyin glass
Trained to blow up commercial aircraft
Trained in chemical weapons class
Just to see how long a niggas breathll last
I put him in a leather mask spray his ass with a can of pepper gas
Then watch him grab his neck and gag
Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh
You wanna battle is the type of question you should never ask
Nigga pick a tougher task see who the fuckll last
Whoever losell get a solderin iron up the ass
You need to recognize my hand is quicker than the eye
Quicker than the fivespeed Jamiroquai drives
A lifespan longer than nine lives infinite rhymes that cant die
A nigga with a divine mind
I dedicate this to the wise dedicate it to dimes
Dividin myself into hundred ten times
You cant deny the offerings I offer
Flows that glow with auroras that sparkle like water
Fly like a saucer with the torque of a Porsche
Murder a million MCs then autograph all of their coffins
Been gettin it on since I been born and Imma live long
And Imma be gettin it on til Im gone
Look at all the stages I been on all the songs that I spit on
I took an oath to rip everythin I get on
A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndrome
In the wrist bones from grippin microphones this long
Im just a small fish in a big pond
That gets pissed off whenever I get picked on
Nigga try to flip and get flipped on
My army march a million strong
Like the Nation of Islam with suede Timbs on
Extremely hostile
Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles
A lyrical lynch mob shittin on niggas
Drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on
Duckin down low like we in Nam fightin the Viet Cong
Screamin Incoming when I see a bomb
Speak to your leader surrender your arms
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds
Plus 800000 to even consider a war
And 200000 more to even look hard
You better drop your flag and withdraw
My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors
And smash yall attach yall to the back of my horse
And drag yall across the motherfuckin asphalt
Nine out of ten niggas is frauds you know who you are
Always talkin about your bitches and your cars
Your jewelry and your girls its like we from two different worlds
You motherfuckers really get on my nerves
Cause Im beyond em on some futuristic cyborg shit
I close my eyes when I freestyle
So I could read what prints across them
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer
And cast a fireball into the audience
To barbecue your brain organs
You feel like youve been thrown in a microwave oven
I flame broil suckers then hit em with some more shit the raw shit
Call my reinforcements the Four Horsemen
Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit
I dare a motherfucker to cross it
Ill even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin
Tell him its important
Tell him to call Sting threeway and sing a chorus
Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers cant record it
Call the news Ill kill your reporters
Start a lawsuit Ill kill your lawyers
Fuck the soft shit and fuck what yall think
My albums gold cause my album was the bomb shit
Yall niggas got your ass beat cause you asked for it
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid
Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys
You fuck em in the ass then you give em cash for it
Thats some sick shit homeboy
A hundred years ago theyd have took you to see Sigmund Freud
You fraudulent feminine fragile as a feather is
With an effortless blow Ill crack your whole skeleton
You think you better than Canibus Wheres the evidence
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship
You need to shut the fuck up cause your breath stink
Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints
Battlin me you never win
You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in
Nigga guess again
Cause after Im finished wreckin this shit
Imma drink a whole bottle of Henny and go fuck a lesbian

To maintain is my main aim
Step aside while I do my dang thang
Im knowing that yall cant hang
To the best what Im doin
Aint nothin bout to change man
Im bout to school all these young cats take em to church
They still rockin the block I move the universe
With a verse I murk any kid up on my turf
Like a lady in Maiti Im shady and ready to burst
Hold up when you roll up
Dont you know the girl Lyte stay swole up
Keep it glazed like a donut
Get em hard now Pull they card now
Get em tore up from the floor up
I gave em something to remember me 
Should have been a friend of me
Elbows I got you nursin all your injuries
They want the best of me to get next to me
Feel the realness Then they want to question me
Whered you get that flow from
How long you been rappin and like old men can I come 
On tour with ya
Grab the mic hit the stage get raw with ya
Till I drop on the floor with ya
x2
Im much too quick for this
Your jealousy is like a sickness
I run my life like a business
This is the raw deal no time for small meals
I want a copter to fly me to the lobster
Still workin in the hood but I roll like a rockstar
And get respect like a Rasta
Nobody move nobody get hurt
If you seein my POV you understand my work
Is for the good but the skill still hot
I leave the spot shook so give it your best shot
Im out to make the best out of what I present
And you see me make a dollar out of 15 cent
I keeps the cash flow and I stash it low
They on the other side thinkin how the grass grow
So green so lean so fresh its 
Nothin left to know except Im hot to death
x2
Never burn what I earn
Come smart with the chips floss hard in the whip
And most of these cats know Im hard to get with
So before they get going Ima make em all quit And sit
And think about a strategy to get close to me
Cause right now youre just soso to me
I keep it so bitter So gully so wizza
So on and on know that Lytes no quitter
Like that big bunny
Im on a mission for the money
Years later and the haters still want me
Without a CD released Lytes platinum in the streets
When they face the truth they cant compete
When I grace the booth I show my steeze
I got days of proof its about me
I keep it movin like a locomotive
You want a challenge Come on lets toetotoe it

This is for gangstas this is for gentlemen
Theres two kind of people out there
I happen to be the boss type
Im a product of my environment
Blame the streets I am what they made me
My pops came from BedStuy my mom came from Africa
Im all nigga if you know what I mean
They hooked up in the 70s when liquor and weed was heavy
And had me in Corona Queens
By the time I was seven my mom left my pop
Then we moved to the south side of Yonkers New York
Then my mom remarried had my little brother Gary
My sister a year later let me gather my thoughts
By the time I was nine I was outta my mind
My step pops didnt like me beat me outta my mind
Ten and eleven the same I never would change
He still had to hit me aggravate a little nigga
Still wearin Skippys
Garf had Adidas and Pumas I coulda had a pair
But Mommy said wait til Christmas but I needed em sooner
If you heard I was broke dawg it wasnt a rumor
I said Gangstas ride Ride with me 
Gentlemen live your life Live it up 
Cause Gangstas die We all gon die 
Its only a matter of time The clock tickin 
It was 1986 and I was twelve years old
Thats right around the time when crack came out
It was the best thing that happened to me
I swear to God cause I was gettin everything that I was askin about
First we started off baggin up me and Garf
Then shit start addin up we gettin smart
Now we on Broadway coppin our own base
Bring it home and put it in bottles sit in Serato
Drink an OE and scramble like it wasnt tomorrow
Im gettin kicked out of Junior High thinkin Im grown
Garf bust with the yellow rabbit
And I had every color Delt we was gettin it on
I was out robbin Mexicans six in the morn
Mom said I had a F again riffin Im gone
Nigga get a little looted and grown soup in the dome
Fuck me up worst when I went to the group home
I said Gangstas ride Ride with me 
Gentlemen live your life Live it up 
Cause Gangstas die We all gon die 
Its only a matter of time The clock tickin 
Im leavin out a lotta shit nigga its too real
My alcoholic backround the welfare motels
Abuse that I had to take struggle at my moms recruit
How the fuck Im gon bond wit you
And the cases I got up to date told you that I bust a eight
Got niggas I cant name outta state niggas fuck with weight
Little brother gone but I got a baby angel
You fuckin with a dirty name dont let these niggas change you
The presents what you get
And the past is what make the man future
I cant tell you I aint God or lil Superman
No there aint a S on my chest but its a D on my block DBlock 
Cause in life the deepest lesson is death
Im determined and Im disciplined and destined to rest
Im a Gangsta and a Gentleman Panero the best
When I pass Im like gas motherfuckers
Cause Im a leave a stain that youll never forget
I said Gangstas ride Ride with me 
Gentlemen live your life Live it up 
Cause Gangstas die We all gon die 
Its only a matter of time The clock tickin 
This gangsta and this gentleman shit is about being humble
But at the same time let niggas know whats real
And when I say you real I could flip
But at the same time I could talk to a nigga at the same time
If he dont respect that then you gotta show em youre gangsta
He respect that you show em youre gentleman
Cause you respect him as a man
Thats what a gangsta and a gentleman is about

2911,"The Ballad Eminem Diss Lyrics
Canibus Canibus
Fuckin with Canibus fuckin with Canibus
Im about eight thousand miles away from home
Thinking about the throne I got my eyes fixated on
I just put an ad in The Source to cause a little controversy
Came from doing a concert out in Jersey last Thursday
A kid said Eminem wanted to hurt me
He called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me
His rhyme was very weak I didnt know he had words for me
I bet hes probably never even heard of me
Ever since I met Stan he took me kinda personally
It didnt even occur to me he was involved personally
With Stan earlier than me now hes perturbed at me
I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me
He told me him and D12 were gonna murder me
And anytime that Im ready that hes got a verse for me
Damn I didnt know he was that thirsty for me
I guess he aint the only emcee thats nervous of me
There aint a person in the game with more courage than me
From France to Germany they call me the merchant of beef
What you want yo Red or white meat
Meet me in Petty Im with JRU and sightseeing
And man I got a nice feeling
Im working on my fourth album and now that I think about it Ive had a tight career
Havent I made it quite clear Lyrically Ill always be right here
And nobody can snatch my mic here
Rip the Jacker was a nightmare
Jack the Ripper truly reminds me of him and I dont really like that
What type of a life is that
Its like Anthony Hopkins giving Norman Bates a nightcap
Damn I can write raps Im good at it aint I
Niggas call my name out cause they want the mic back
But I raise the price so high that in fact
The market is collapsin niggas dont know how to act
I guess the worlds chaos is spinning over the raps
They make you sign a contract and con you out of your tracks
Dont act like you dont know Bis
The man with the organic tongue and the golden spit
I left you frozen stiff
With molten Aluminum and molded tip
Ill pierce a hole through a brick you know I can Rip
Say give me five Ill show you six quicker than you can blink
Probably quicker than you can think
As quick as ink drives my rhymes are contagious like pink eye
The hypnotize you to dickride
Im Illmatic like Nas and Stillmatic like Escobar
No Im not still at it with Todd
Dont blame me it aint my fault it never was
Before I even knew him I already had a buzz
But that was then and this is now
Bis been ripping in down since the day he came out
See Ive been there done that I dont even have to make a comeback
I move over to France where the loves at
Become a bureaucrat and start cutbacks
Create a cure for AIDS with a device that connects to the nut sack
Capable of altering a mans blood pattern
Humanitarians will love that
I start a label with other acts get a couple plaques
And completely cover the map before I come back
I wanna give Alicia Keys a kiss
Compose a ballad and just make her fiend for Bis
Im an extremist when Im on some MC shit
And after this you could never not believe in Bis
Terry Stone UK clique keeping it thick
Use my name motherfuckers when you speaking to Bis

546,"I Got the Keys Freestyle Lyrics
Yeah Im starting to have fun now so you know
I got the keys keys keys
I got the keys keys keys
Yall are the kings kings kings
I roll up to squeeze
Yall are the kings kings kings
Well Im about to see Im about to see
I talk scrilla like a art dealer
Im large money thats been augmented for the small printer
Homocide business got me side flipping like Im cartwheeling
Im Godzilla wearing Margiela in the mall inside of the Guitar Center
Got the boss mental
Got me off a little barking at the dog kennel
Keys open doors I said keys open doors squeeze open fours
Leave your boys leaking leave your overlord lookin like some old weave on the floor
Please dont ignore me Im going to war
Blowing weed in a foreign toy
My shooters killing anything Im pointing towards
Anything Im pointing towards
I would swing this mic when Im rhyming thought I better bring it
Im what youd get if Fetty Wap were to rob a marksman
With Robert Markman a dead eye Genius
A Jedi demon he sip promethazine I bet I lean him
I made a million I aint sell out I just got the hell out Neimans
Nigga my chips up ask me am I in my PRI I stop you just so I could spell out Pringles
Im in the strip club I shell out singles
Im the flowing boss sweeping semis pick one
Head or tails either way you are about to let Akeem in
I came in here to grow the crime rate
Bodies on top of bodies on me
I got skeletons in my closet that could do the Famous video with Kanye
My status loony nigga I love my chrome
IMac and Uzi more than Donald Glover love that song Bad and Boujee
Bad and Boujee Im a black addict mooly
With an attitude in a padded room full of savage ghoulies
Eratic goonies
I dont battle I look at battle dudes like Battle Who me
Fuck you niggas Im steady waiting I fed him bake
You know that devils food them Betty Cakes
And I got something for them crooked cops too let him pray
Turn his wedding day Freddie Gray
Let that machete behead him set him straight
Let it devastate let his soul levitate let the levies break
Im murderous I got Reaganomics in my verbiage
Im a wavy rhymer a Mercedes rider
Im a 89er Cartier with diamonds
At the furrier Saint Laurent sipping Merlot
You would never catch me boxing with the burner
Hundred in your mouth like Ted DiBiase did to Virgil
Rolling over these hurdles playing C Murder then Im playing G Herbo
Gang of cash on me keep the thumper with me since I became a sinner
Black youngster I dont know if Imma tip the waitress tonight
Or make it rain for dinner
I dont know if Imma sign a deal or stay independent its not just a simple thing
Aston Martin topless while Im weighing my options on the triple beams
Learning that life aint about the expensive shit its about the simple things
Like a sexy side bitch with zipper lip clit nipple rings
You can not stop what is already going
African bitch got her face on my lap
The blacker she is the badder she is
I was called tarbaby growing and Im feeling up to par
Whenever I see the police
I address them as top of the morning cause I feel above the law
Riding do I look like I am supplying the drugs Fuck raw
I am the plug fuck raw
You niggas is about as much action as a buttonedup bra
Im taking everybody instrumental going Ted Bundy on it
Out here cooking so much the original sound like its Peg Bundy on it
Im Christmas gifting yall wrapping shit
I fit the description of accidents in the axel of the bent
I have an immaculate acumen
You a splitting image of accidental flatulence
All it takes to be a gang banger on wax these days
Is the engineer that come in and patch you in
Yes sir Im too charming to stress ya
Im cool calm and collective
Im electric you Carmen Electra
If I catch ya you gone on the stretcher
Now question
How much protection does a vest and armor get ya
Especially when you armed with weapons stepping in the wrong direction of armageddon
Uh keys keys yall got the keys keys
Ride up and squeeze squeeze
Yall are the kings kings heh well Im about to see

3089,"Once upon a time in the black part of the city
Yo G yo G you better get out of here man 50
Door swings shut car peels out
Yo Ice Cube man
Whassup man
Why you
Whassup
Yo Ice Cube man why you always kickin the shit about the bitches and the niggas
Why dont you kick some shit about the kids man The fuckin kids
Word
Little boys and girls they all love me
Come sit on the lap of ICE
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punkass nigga I knew
Named Jack he wasnt that nimble wasnt that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two and he had the ho
At that type of shit hes a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr Bombay
Got a shot in the ass and he was on his way
To make some money why not
Down on Sesame Street the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front but in back marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out Little Bo Peep smoked out
Saw her and her friends sellin sheepskins
Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo my empty sheepskins
Yo baby whats up with that
Hickory dickory dock it was twelve oclock
Cinderella aint home must be givin up the cock
I dont doubt it she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors too
Red Riding Hood and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence Yo I dont know
But Ice Cubell tell the kids how the story should go
Yeah money thats it yeah money thats it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey rock that shit
Well you know the rest
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint drinkin some 8ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin for the wolf to kill
Theyre fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now theyre enemies cause hes a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
Were gonna fuck up the pigs and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence Yo I dont know
But Ice Cubell tell the kids how the stories should go
Ayo man was that dope enough for you
Yeah you aight you in the house
We outta here seeya
Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass
Some bedtime story huh

634,"You want powerbut youre not big enough
So you steal it piece by piece tainted and spoiled
And youre weak step by step youll weaken and the power
I harness the power of the chakra remote viewing into darkness
Describing what I see in the process
Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects
Geoglyphs on the Pampa
A dose of polaramine makes it feel like a dream
The dream state is the playground for the supreme
Critics attempt to follow a trend
Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men
To create a universe all I need
Is one thousand trillion trillion degrees
Sodium 22 betatrons and a cloud chamber
Keep the noise down so I dont arouse my neighbors
Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman
In an unopened CocaCola can
Showed the whole plan in coded program
Encrypted by a ProScan modem with a low band
Hold up let me load it in
Put a curse on you
You want to take over
You clash with cyanide gas and die fast
Another mystery Are you gonna put a curse on me
Theres no need
Rhythmical equivalent of solids liquids and gas
I was created by intelligent design
You are merely a descendant of the unmodified
You diss me out of pride but when youre finished
Talking about money and bitches youre simply out of rhymes
Even my worst album was sublime
If I dont slow down Ill distort the timeline
Back through the time tunnel to a 100 Bars again
A master like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon
The grand architect
Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory but I lost the bet
No regrets you live and you learn
Im through giving advice I just give concern
Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs
And try to rebuild all the bridges Ive burned
I prefer modesty over controversy
But what am I to do when these jerks keep bothering me
Jealous because they cant rhyme like me
And they never had a scientific mind like me
Im above average with verbal semantics
The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad
They look at me like Poor bastard
Why cant you manipulate Billboard with all your metaphor magic
No matter how hard I practiced
Every microphone I saw I grabbed it obviously thats the wrong tactic
I went through a long period of mourning and sadness
When I wrote that Stan shit
But if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so
And Ill come out the egg roll with seven dead scrolls
If you can find a better flow
Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago
Hey you shouldnt fall for the naivete
Lyrically Im the illest but my beats is okay
Food for thought nutrition for the whole brain
Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day
Im ahead of my time or so they say
I guess thats why I already feel old and grey
OK thats enough knowledge for today Im killing them
You better not forget it cause this is Levitibus

Better not violate on my turf nigga yous in danger to die like that
Aint no investigation no statements and no witnesses we aint seen shit
Pull up after dark with that jewelry on to come see a bitch that way he get it
We on dark road with no street lights that pistol play after fist fights
And them geek monsters walk all night with they crack pipes tryna get right
Midnight we shoot dice the whole house smelling like cooked crack
You beat me and you talk shit you get shot bitch and I took that
Hoodrats on deck that loud is all I blow
This shit to you might sound wild but this life is all I know
Smoking weed riding chrome

At fifteen I was fullgrown get wrong get bust on
My uncle gave me a bunch of work and that shit was gone by the next morning
Young wild nigga runnin with me homicide wasnt nothing to us
Dead body wasnt nothin to see that pistol play was just fun to us
I was 19 with two felonies one of my best friend had a life sentence
How my uncle Fred was just like me and had a bunch of partners no longer living
All about that cocaine dealing no education no pot to piss in
Old school on chrome wheel window tinted pistol hidden
Thats the shit that I come from in my heart fear aint none

Get their pistols get pissed on pistolwhipped and stripped homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me caught them talking down tryna bitch on me
And they snitch on me aint got shit on me so my guess is death is what they wish on me

1457,"Thousand lives ago
We were young and we didnt know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice headed back to the light
But be careful dont drown in the gold
I know it glows but its cold
Im from the other side of town out of bounds
To anybody who dont live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair
Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones
And Four CHs Vice Lords Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix street organizations
They gave violations hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases bad broads good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin that the feds dont get us
The era of Reagan the terror of Bush
Crack babies mamas apush we were the products of Bush
Im wishin for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to BBD Do Meyou heard of Flukey
Stokes It was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation diamonds blinding us
Some real shit we facing
Forties wasting on seats Dion making the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escaping the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed
You know what they dont see sometimesthat in the neighborhood its the exact same thing Its the same thing over and over again Feel me
Ohoh oohooh ooh
Have you ever heard of No Limit Onethree 300 600 300 
Follyboy OBlock Huh Eastside Yeah 
Where it aint no conversation they just let them heats ride Them heats ride 
Aint nobody stop the violence why my city keep lying They keep lying 
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying They keep dying 
Used to post up on that strip I looked like a street sign Im out here 
Ive been out there three days and I got shot at three times Damn 
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind Thats fucked up 
I know haters wanna clap me up watch the morgue wrap me up What 
But they can catch me later I been cooling chasing paper Bands 
Where I come from aint no hope if you was claimed then that was major Major 
Small crib big fam Mom was working Granny raised us Raised us 
No food in the frigerator I was banging pulling capersthats real shit Real shit 
Same niggas from Day One boy yeah Im still with Im still with 
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit Swish 
Homie take your shorty lunchbox and wont feel shit
I came from a place where its basic but you dont make it Nah 
Feds building cases judges who racist and full of hatred
I mean you aint never seen the shit that I seen Huh 
Ohohoh

Fresh and Im fresh and my fresh just get fresher
Diamonds in production glow greater than the pressure
The none turn to some and the some turn to more
The more turn to many and the many turn to all
Shoutin all or nothing like its nothing at all
Do not kno what ya got til it got gone
Same song new time signature
New brand hustle with the long time arithmetic
Bey from the preacher man number man understand
Curves and sliders overs and underhands
Black Batman knock em out the park
Pitch quiet fire sniper not the one you tryna box with
Block work when the block turn jobless
And triple beams aint the best means to weigh your options
Smarts get smart with your smartness
Too busy surviving to argue bout DarwinDarling
See me huh a pretty dancer
Me Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it see me do it 
Ready steady step it out
Big swing swing with bangers and thing thingers
Soul glo zinging all over the ring finger
Yo yo Dont play me so close
Make me tell you something that you aint really ready to know
Fight camp you was in top form
Fight night damn you aint breakin popcorn
Aw man word bond
Word is bond Ultimatum
Lights off smelling salts resuscitate em
I dont underrate em son I dont nothingrate em
All I do is pop pop frustrate em
Exacerbate em sharp shoot lacerate em
Steady hustle shuffle shuffle fascinate em

45,"Im just a picture in a frame
I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
But I dont control the colors
Yo Im ten steps ahead of niggas that shit scary
Sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like Mack maintain just grind dog better yourself
So what I do I take heed and pick up the pace
Cant explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face
Im like a black rose growin in the concrete crackin the pavement
There that voice go again Mack practice for greatness
Get paid for them immaculate statements
Keep thinkin of them hot lines like a physic I cant explain it
Theres no pen when I write it its nothing like it
Goddamn what you want from me
What you want me to tell you huh
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh thought I was dumb
But I aint used to use my mind I used to just use my 9
And run wild with my boys in the streets wild with these wars
Now the Quran and 48 laws they polish my flaws
Im movin niggas like puppets with no strings attached
Its nothin for Beans so you know it aint a thing for Mack
To look in your eyes see through your heart know what you fearin
Pick you apart like you niggas is transparent
I see right through you niggas 
Its like Mack was born with advanced parents
Im like the Sun shinin at night
Imagine it dog I know you wanna see me gradually fall
But Im walkin on air breakin every gravity law
Its nothin like it I swear
I spit words that skip through air
Let the words of a true thug hit your ear
It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
Its nothin like it
Goddamn shit I cant explain it
Fuck yall niggas
I changed my whole life in about 9 months just like sperm in a womb
These young niggas never learn til they doomed
Try to tell them you can burn young punk without smellin the fumes
Make you shiver in the middle of June
Paint a picture so vivid you can hang it up in your room
Shine bright like a prism displayin colors like Crayola
Think of the prisons with straight soldiers
Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
Think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture Im paintin its so perfect
Open your eyes motherfuckers you cant duck us
No survivors every soul shall suffer
Im loadin up revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise its like jihad with these mags Ima bust ya
Goddamn its nothin like it Im serious
Cant explain how I write it

685,"Well its almost nightfall
And theres no forecast of rainfall
And Im in the mood for a party
So Im gonna go out to a club
And give the dancefloor body
So I jump in the car and go to the venue
Walk in the door and now Im on the menu
Guys in the house theyre watching me
Theyre clocking me theres no stopping me
Desire I know you want me
Youre fine Thank you
But Im not the type of girl that you think I am
I dont jump into the arms of every man
But Im paid I dont need your money

Easy lover is something that I aint
Besides I dont know you from a can of paint
Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys
I always hear yo baby
I mean like whats the big idea

Treat me like a lady
And no my name aint yo and I aint got your baby
Im looking for a guy whos sincere

Perfect for the Queen Latifah me
Fly girl fly girl
Come here cuz youre sexy and youre fine
And I want you to be mine
Fly girl fly girl
Have no fear your heart is in good hands
Wont you let me be your man
All my friends are in relationships
Some of them good ones and some of them bad ones
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones
You see loving it aint hard to get
I want a friend not just a lover
Someone who is dedicated only to me
Not to me and two or three others
One who will not lie to me or think
He can get my love by buying me
I know Ill find him someday
And when I find him
He sure wont say
Lounging sitting in the house
And Im cooling first day of the week
So theres nothing to do
And Im in the mood for a real soft kiss
Momma never said therell be days like this
So I called her and we talked for a while
Hang up the phone feeling better
With a smile
Its cool cuz 91 is my year
And this time I know Im gonna hear
Fly girl

775,"Uhh Yeah yeah
Funky song ha ha
Cause aint nothin goin on but a funky song
Yes yes yes
KRocks is gonna rock I mean go get hype
So you people all aboard and Lyte has the light
Fresh this dope promise this too strong
And yo you cant go wrong with a funky song
I dont know the reason
For which that Ive become fanatic
For some bass drums and a few hihats
But yo please dont say microphone
Cause Ill be forced to kick whoever thinks they king off they throne
But yo people talk speakers and sneakers if you wanna
Yeah I like the cars that go boom I wont front yup
Annnd people talkin woofers and the tweeters
I like to go above ten on the volume cause yo its
Just a touch or bass a little bit a little bit 
Now check the rhythm the rhyme yeah it fits
It steals your mind like a needle
And then holds on to it like a hostage
And amazement is shown on ALL your faces
To what MC Lyte has given
Yo Im definitely proud to say
Those that never heard the tunes well its time to vic
So cough up your dollars put your money where your mouth is
And we can surely as hell get down to business
Dont ever doubt me or what Im capable of
I have to show and prove that I am a thug
Or should I say the ultimate yeah thats perfect
Cause Im as ultimate as money can get
So get the ghetto blaster boombox whatever you call it
Grab it by the handle and start to haul it
If youre chillin in your car open up your back windows
Turn the volume up and let the sounds flow
Or pop a tape in your Benzi box
And drive ten miles per hour through every block
So they can hear the hiphop pumpin in the ride
And when youre finished press autoreverse and play the other side
When youre talkin to my deejay a talk a crossfader
His organized Technicsll leave a flavor later
Cause just like a basshead CHIN crack greater
And try his hits like Yo this sure tastes
Im in high pursuit hope I dont have to shoot
Get down or sit down with all of you
So when you call on my deejay a call him KRock
And when you thought you heard it all here comes the shock
My rhymes hotter than a danger lie
Its just like that dont ask why
But Im cool cooler than the rocks on a mountaintop
Cause yo Lyte lift the party up further yup
And if youre comin to the jam yo its like a hijack
Once you step in theres no turnin back
Its hypnotism done every time
Youre stickin out your tongue to get a taste of the rhyme
And just like I planned it satisfies your tastebuds
Its silky and milky cause your mouth to flood all over you
Dribble and drool you still remain cool
Cause thats what Im like rap is made to do
But anyway since I dont think my job is complete
Say goodnight til the next time we meet
",Grab it by the handle and start to haul it If youre chillin in your car open up your back windows Turn the volume up and let the sounds flow Or pop a tape in your Benzi box And drive ten miles per hour through every block So they can hear the hiphop pumpin in the ride And when youre finished press autoreverse and play the other side When youre talkin to my deejay a talk a crossfader His organized Technicsll leave a flavor later Cause just like a basshead CHIN crack greater And try his hits like Yo this sure tastes Im in high pursuit hope I dont have to shoot Get down or sit down with all of you So when you call on my deejay a call him KRock And when you thought you heard it all here comes the shock My rhymes hotter than a danger lie Its just like that dont ask why But Im cool cooler than the rocks on a mountaintop Cause yo Lyte lift the party up further yup And if youre comin to the jam yo its like a hijack Once you step in theres no turnin back Its hypnotism done every time Youre stickin out your tongue to get a taste of the rhyme And just like I planned it satisfies your tastebuds Its silky and milky cause your mouth to flood all over you Dribble and drool you still remain cool Cause thats what Im like rap is made to do But anyway since I dont think my job is complete Say goodnight til the next time we meet,Uhh Yeah yeah Funky song ha ha Cause aint nothin goin on but a funky song Yes yes yes KRocks is gonna rock I mean go get hype So you people all aboard and Lyte has the light Fresh this dope promise this too strong And yo you cant go wrong with a funky song I dont know the reason For which that Ive become fanatic For some bass drums and a few hihats But yo please dont say microphone Cause Ill be forced to kick whoever thinks they king off they throne But yo people talk speakers and sneakers if you wanna Yeah I like the cars that go boom I wont front yup Annnd people talkin woofers and the tweeters I like to go above ten on the volume cause yo its Just a touch or bass a little bit a little bit Now check the rhythm the rhyme yeah it fits It steals your mind like a needle And then holds on to it like a hostage And amazement is shown on ALL your faces To what MC Lyte has given Yo Im definitely proud to say Those that never heard the tunes well its time to vic So cough up your dollars put your money where your mouth is And we can surely as hell get down to business Dont ever doubt me or what Im capable of I have to show and prove that I am a thug Or should I say the ultimate yeah thats perfect Cause Im as ultimate as money can get So get the ghetto blaster boombox whatever you call it
1327,"Tony Story Pt 2 Lyrics
Paulie killed Tony right Right 
And Tony killed Ty so it was only right Right 
Thinkin back twenty years they was homies tight
Sixth grade for the love of the paper aint nothin nice Uhuh 
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles blowing paper balling hard he know they hating
But they gon respect it cause he rocked Tony Tony 
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding they ready to fall for him They ready 
Cause word on the street that Paulie did that That 
Used Key gold digging ass to get back Back 
Text him through her phone found out where he live at Yeah 
She woke up in the morning like I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth fitting to start a war
Cause Tonys little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law Lord 
And Paulie on a rise now On a rise 
Niggas that played the middle pickin sides now Pickin sides now 
Plus he heard Tonys brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head he gotta die now I want this nigga dead 
Paulies youngest on the corner
Tonys little brother he slipping yeah hes a goner
Fuckin with that lean he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too reachin bet you they get up on him
The gat jam he bang back tryna avoid em
Them niggas dumpin he get up running and hittin on em
He hit the alley get a body he dipping on em
Said its on now try and kill em its war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feelin like he dead it aint no remorse now
Gettin high and he thinking bout kicking in doors now Get on the floor 
Momma and little kids get on the floor now Ah 
Finger on the trigger he feel it its going down Ooh 
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain its really gon pour down
And its raining like Katrina he got thirty in his Nina Strapped 
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his Bimmer Thirty 
Paulie wasnt in it when he heard it he was steaming Kill this nigga 
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin
And he want this nigga dead fore Sunday hit Hit 
But youngin tryna live on some Sunday shit Yeah 
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And Paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show em how its done so he loadin up his gun Murder 
And show this young nigga he fucked with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin the long gun
And its on sight he dont give a fuck if the law come
So he out here
Ridin dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurkin
They tryna murder heard he out there
Niggas spinin they try and hit him
Hittin every corner seein niggas but he aint with em He aint 
A youngin layin low he know Paulie aint playin though Nah 
Theres money on his head and niggas is sayin Go Its real 
But youngin he aint scared he cool as a fan though
He know its get down with that burner or end up a taggedtoe
It was four in the morn Morn Paulie goin home Home 
Windshields wipin middle of the rain storm Storm 
And Paulie he aint slipping yeah he got that thang on Yeah 
You know what he did to Tony he wont get the same song so Damn 
When he hit the crib he spin the block fore he park it Park 
Paulie aint a bitch nah Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talkin Talkin 
And out his rear view its like he seen a reaper walking Yeah 
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparkin
Shots hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching trigger squeezin trying get him off him Ah 
Them shots ringing youngins squeezing clip empty
Thats when Paulie rose like Derrick put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face You aint learn from your brother nigga

3467,"Shackles are heavy on the wrist
Stacked like sardines belly of a ship
Live in your own piss and shit and being seasick
Cracked across your back with a thick leather whip
Salt water burns through your wounds
Women are starving with babies in their wombs
On your hands and knees trying to cry God please
Exhausted your voice is too weak to speak
Neighbors and strangers are dying beside you
Their decaying bodies youre tied to
Cling tight to your fight for survival
Wonder if your tribe will ever try to find you
Arrive somewhere strange the air is cold
You can see your breath and youre barely clothed
Your first time ever seeing snow
Sleeping next to it on a hard dirt floor
Go from cant seeing see in the morning to cant see at night
You work till your hands bleed white
Your native language you cant recite
Murdered on sight if you try to read or write
When you bend all of your life and cant see the light
It gets painful to stand upright
Right
And your eyes bear the sight of your wife
Being being pulled out your shack and brutalized at night
You only taste joy when babies are born
Which becomes an occasion to mourn
Separated torn from your celebrating arms
Then as quickly as they came they were gone
Sold away from your farm this is all theyve known
Never heard stories from home
They forget your name
The culture from which you came
Teaching itll get you slain
Praying to your God will get you the same
Tortured to near death lest you complain
No choice left you sing through the pain
And pray that your suffering wasnt in vain
End of your chain end of your life
Your grandchildren born with no end in sight
So you muster up all of your might
And your last breath comes out fight 
This is actually true
Now stop and imagine thats you
Now stop imagining unravel the truth and ask just who is it happening to
Everything that the passenger do
The driver experience too
So if humanity is one
Then we all get burned when its hell that were traveling through
Youve got to save my soul
Put me back together make me whole
Said we dont know which way to go
Take my hand and place me on that road
Trapped in a history we dont understand
Cant remember how this blood got on our hands
Never been taught about the ugly past
Expecting God not to punish man
Our ancestors brought us control
We realize now that the cost was our soul
Got me feeling like an empty shell
Prison guard that inherited a cell
Im desperate to find my place
Emptiness lies behind my face
Flowers only die in a vase
A heart only dies encased in a lie we call race
I hear the song but I cant sing along
Somethings really wrong I cant put my finger on
Terrified to admit its wrong
Cause Im hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on
Our identity is hinged upon the miserable myth weve been taught since were born
Until we mend what was torn
The debt of a sin lingers long after the vicitims moans
This is actually true
Now stop and imagine thats you
Now stop imagine and unravel the truth
And ask just who is it happening to
Everything that the passenger do the driver experience too
So if humanity is one then we all get burned when its hell that were traveling through

3552,"Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know
Come on watch the garden grow
Ill see you when you get there
Uh alright yeah two fifteen yo
Downtown for the win woah
Sean C for the tempo Portugal for the intro
This is Arctical Don Disco from the one choir
Calling shots like an umpire
Where I live yo man I done lost mad kinfolk
Over gunfire through the window
As a young squire who become Sire
I had no way to tell what I was in for
I was 59 like Royce with the giant voice like Mik Winslow
Never been quite lik them so Im on my own time
Mind darker than a coal mine
Thoughts deeper than a gold mine
So Im out here slangin on this blade
Hopin that I dont get cut by these police
Makin raids on those of us who know whats up
My lil homies my lil sons
Got them keys and they got them drums
Making superstitious runs on them insufficient funds
No more rules in this here shit toddlers packin a revolver
How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber
See you with that heater you sweeter than peach cobbler
If it aint about that paper then man that aint what Reek habla
Man you know whats goin they say Woke about that dope
Ask them fiends about them keys bout that coke bout that smoke
Two fifteen my city man and we it from round here
If its crazy where you at then it aint no different round here
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Yo reminiscin over old times sip a little bit of Oban
When the wind blow like a land mine balled up fist now
Who the fucks this calling on the landline
Back back like a hair line I dont really want the air time
I dont wanna smile for the camera damn I just wanna see my fam rise
I can feel when a man lies tryin to grow old and wise
And Im still fly like airlines stay sharp like samurais
Dip low like Camron Big Show when its slam time
Word to my nigga Anton
Bogarting through this door
Hopin that it dont get shut
By these police makin raids on those of us who know whats up
My lil uzi weighs a ton man I truly aint the one
My lil junior straight from juvie make a movie gangster run
Yall confusin this here shit with some television drama
None of yall lil mamas touching Mr Trotter
Even with that heater you sweeter than peach cobbler
Real ones out here winnin you swimmin in deep agua
Click pow Im a rebel just for kicks now
Been down with the get down
You aint sayin shit sit down
This loud twenty one pound my town
Man we it from round here
If they bout it where you from then it aint no different down here listen

Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there

But you also gotta remember where your people at
Cause you always should want to love your people unconditionally no matter what

So I can use you for your energy
You know its real shit feel this
America got a thing for this gangster shit they love me
Black Chukkas black skully leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramos shit Im a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my treyeight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in New Jack I holla Cancel that bitch
Look at me this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low the NARCs dont know
Im the weatherman I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back watch it turn to dope watch it go out the do
O after O you know
Homie Im just triple beam dreaming niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life the fiends are just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you cant see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle 
Nigga you get in my way while Im trying to get mine
And Ill buck you Buck you 
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you Fuck you 
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle 
Yeah I dont know shit about gymnastics I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave niggas cant fuck with me
Man my cods call me Chef Boyar50
Check my logic smokers dont like seeds in they weed shit
Send me them seeds Ill grow them what they need
Them aint Chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And Im selling them for 500 a pop goddamn it
I sell anything Im a hustler I know how to grind
Step on grapes put it in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious hypnotic it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot Id be that potent product
Now get a load of me flashy far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle 
Nigga you get in my way while Im trying to get mine
And Ill buck you Buck you 
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you Fuck you 
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle 
Its the Hustlers Ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin
The drama means nothing its part of the game
Catch me in the coup switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win Im full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up but Im back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender make a protein shake
Im like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefnerll tell you he aint got shit on me
The feds watch me icey they cant stop me
Racist pointing at me Look at Niggaraci hello
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle

2805,"Four in the morning now where am I at On the track
Distributin crack wth my hand on my gat fat
Not cause the spot be hotter than a torch
The fiends gettin they pipe dreams on the back porch
I havent been asleep tryna stack chips underneath my mattress
I gotta see the judge on the 5th
Until then Im the cake cuttin cookie making
Baking soda measurer illegal money treasurer
Searchin for an ultimatum looking for a way out
Prison aint the way for me so Im tryna stay out
A couple of young niggas I know keep my yay in steady flow
Even though Im tryna stop my clientele continue to grow
So I want to quit and get legit and pay taxes
Practice new tactics with the cheese beneath my mattress
What should I do open a soul food restaurant
Where all the ballers come after early morning blunts
What about a place for a tight stereo
Full of the best shit like autoradio
But I dont know its a hard decision to make mane
Tryna think of something to do to get out the game
What can I do
What can I do to get out the game get out the game
What can I do to get out the game
What can I do
What can I do to get out the game get out the game
What can I do to get out the game
What can I do
What can I do to get out the game get out the game
What can I do to get out the game
What can I do
What can I do to get out the game get out the game
What can I do to get out the game
Hell aint nothing like a laundry for your money
Cleanin up all the fifth turnin that shit to honey
Funny how the barber and beauty and beeper shops
Occupy the spaces and places around the block
Charges gettin too damn large for me to take
Rules gettin too damn hard for me to break
Hate to stay out the game for so long
Tired of doin shit for myself its feeling wrong
Niggas that I came up with is gettin noid
Shoppin with strangers and checkin their own boys
Instigations made by certain hoes
Got a player hatin on the down low
So I keeps my mind in the motherfucking greatest type of condition
To avoid being missin
Wishin that the money would help me forget about all the chances
But certain chances led to other circumstances
Ridin in the streets 4 deep after midnight
Packin the heat thats how we creep to keep the shit tight
But know the IRS know my name I cant buy a damn thang
So tell me what can I do to get out the game
What can I do
What can I do to get out the game get out the game

Today is a new day oh what a lovely day
Im gonna try a new way to make my brain power pay
Scope the tight spot to open up a night spot
Supposed to meet the man about the lease on the lot
Got half way up out the house when what do you know
Somebody wanted me to reopen the drug store
Now would it be different if I would jugglin on the light side
I would go meet the man and let that dope shit slide
But every time a nigga come with a bigger figure
I gotta dash home and get my fuckin serve on
Makin fast money hook me like nicotine
This on the street shit is deeper than a submarine
One day I want to have a wife and live twice as nice
Afraid Im gonna lose my life before I get it right
Stuck like glue in this underground life click
My hard headedness got me in some stupid shit
I thought it was safe to put the house in my momma name
Till I was busted and all the fucked up drama came
I coulda sold my whole soul to the devil
To be smackin the FEDs across the head
With a shovel I was hauled away
A sunny day on my streets
Shackle the cuff with no shoes on my feet
They slammin down face first on the brick
And looked at my daddy like boy you better not say shit
Now aint that bitch a real motherfucking fag
Wanna be hard and hide behind a rusty ass badge
Embarrassed as fuck my own kids have to watch
While daddy was beaten and being drugged by a cop
And now that the bubble had been busted in my shit
They looked at my family like we was all unlegit
The block was shocked because my folks was so nice
But the spot was hot because they son led a street life
What can I do
What can I do to get out the game get out the game

Finna witness the murderous monologue of a menace
Comin from out of a sinister formidable place
I can let you know the ins and the outs
And I can spit it wicked twisted
And you can see by the look of my face
Gimme the mic and Ima mangle it tangle it
Definitely the people see that I got the hang of it
Pity you gotta try to make a mockery of a city who
Block em and block em buck at you baby we dangerous

Killers who chop you we got to stop you
Pop you partner you gushin
Get up outta the way when Tecca Nina be bustin
Gotta give it up Im a veteran like Edison
Ima light em up and get in your head again

Sever it hit the mic and then we peddlin medicine
Im a chopper chopper chopper
Automatic kickin the ammunition
Killin the competition no it aint nobody
Hotter hotter hotter
Damagin everything and everybody
You know we on a mission listen to me
How can I make you understand Im a general
Even if you poppin the competition is minimal
Kancity killers and you can bet that we criminal
The demon inside of me keep on tellin me when to go
So Ima keep reppin the midwest choppers freakin flows
And Im bout to be up on top of this and truly be bustin
Beggin for mercy you punk I aint givin you nothing nothing

Midwest Choppers 
Lyrically we be the best in the Midwest and we caked up
I aint talkin about women Im talkin about paper
DLoc and Dalima enter the center
And get coded and when in the competition we for sure to kill em
I spit like a fully and ready made through any type of weather
With the Beretta tucked right under my sweater
And we hotter than lava
The way that my gillas be keepin it poppin
Partner you tight but my gillas are better
We keep it choppin like a blender eatin boys up for dinner
Guillotines we chop your heads off and throw em out the window
We too critical we ill and you walking away looking so pitiful
The AGT we be the number one contenders
When it come to the street we still post on the block 
40 Cal on my lap and my middle finger up to the cops
On the way to the studio to go and make another hot track
They be lovin the way that we spit it when we drop
They call me DLocsta the Vulture the definition of a soldier
My opposition is more culture than Rocha
I spit like a Tommy and anybody in my way Ima fold em
And me and my gilla gorillas want it cause we the coldest boys
Be tryin to battle cause they want our position
But they can never get in it because we better and bigger
And like I told you we the number one competitors dealin
Workin their way up to the top and they wont stop til they get the millions
In a whole nother century the DLoc and Dalima
Chemistry you can never cross with them
Igganas idah the ebe ossinbay the yricala
Iggertra eavela otherma uckerfays lost
You can try to read us you can try to beat us
Try to get your speed up but it aint gon matter
Cause after we get finished bustin there aint gon be no laughter
We takin over the map with Tecca Nina the master master 
We can sang or we can bang
It aint no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it aint no thang

Yerm sayin we livin in pain

When Im off in a zone I get to representing the city of the K
Hollow your brain cause Im a disaster
Dalima get ridiculous if Im comin at you
Leave em in a predicament cause Im a style master
And Im not impressionable now just so you know
I make em sweat cause Im the best with the flow
Whenever you wanna flex we can go keep stressin your cold
And I bet I leave your neck on the floor
Midwest finna blow like C4 with a low strike 
Cause the energy is the bomb
I can tell that youre fascinated by the way that we rhyme
And we glow like when the four strike with the fire
It aint nothin you can say though 
Cause Im sipin on Henny and bustin like a semi on enemies now
Irritated with the haters that be coming around
So Im kickin like a relevant but an arrogant style
Meaning that Im really sure so
Im too sick for a cure so
Aint a need for a doctor
My verbal word play be making your nerves shake cause I caught you
Pants down when I popped you
Now lets take a trip through the valley of real gill
Strange individuals with a militant ill skill
Pop a collar and holler at the broads with real skrill
Get down for the cause cause we flossin big wheels what up with it 
Dont be acting like you get tough with it
When the choppers come out the truck spitting
All of the Strange gill killas gon be devoted to leavin your body smokin when really you cant get up with us
And thats game thats proper 
Cause whenever Im bustin its like a full heart stopper

2914,"Nobody ever said life was gon be easy
But damn
Just a kid moms died when I was seven
Pops died eleven whats up with heaven
Its hell when youre an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eelskin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all night long
I was like Put me on
But they said Little fellow run and go play
Take your butt to school or else youll have to be like us one day
I didnt understand but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls cause theyd hustle and rob
I was like makin bout 150 a week
And after taxes you know what that is lunch meat
And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car man
I gotta get a girl
I know I can do it out there man
Im gonna go for it man
I gotta get some money
Word
Streets of anger trouble and crime
I had it hard had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up my gear clean
Even when checkin minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels quick to flex with tools
Pimpin hoes on the block
Checkin cash nonstop
Crack spots armor with interior bars
No lie I used to own bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget Cesars Palace holidays
It was on crazy out of control
We made up the word ballin that was how we rolled
But the FBI had awholenother idea
Its called multiple indictments for hundreds of years
What
Daff is dead
Carter got 25 years
Nah
Spike 35 to life
Nah dont tell me BOs dead man
I dont wanna hear that man
I was just with him
The game is vicious no retirement you die young
Listen to a fake he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with brothers I really know
They tell me Ice you got much love in the pen
Youre the one that got away dont wanna see you in
They tell me Tell the little homies the deal
Dont let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel
I marched two million strong in DC
Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me I got a baby son to raise
And bein black aint easy prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together unseparated
Check yourself like I did blackman because were all related

Whassup with me You know whats up with me man
Im trying to get paid in full
Check this out right
Since Javotti is the label
And Im talking over this def beat right here
I think we should turn it up
We got my man TrtrTrend on the beat 
Thinking of the master plan
Where theres nothing but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket my prophet is heaven sent
I dig deeper you know I represent represent
Yeah money over bitches my sisters go over everything
My bandz will make you dance Im forever like a wedding ring
Far above the hate and the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Trying to get away from the 85ers like Evelyn
Ride with me I got em leaking like Nene
Got em leaking like Wiki these monkeys biting like hickeys
Cause theyre seeing what Im doing filling them with confusion
Cutting just like a truant Im fluent just like a student
Of the romance languages only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnishes just like your wages is
The cribs outrageous like really its no joke
The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke loud
Turn it up loud turn it up loud
Turn it up loud turn it up loud
Drop it stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up turnt up turnt up for the people
You can feel the heat from your speaker my sound will darken your features
Run it down like a zebra I move with the speed of cheetahs
Im from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a twolitre
I aint asking for no followers Im looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming all through my semen
So every time I bust babies begin being born
Talk turns tough til them toasters thats tucked get
Drawn like a picture picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leaders the lazy is lollygagging
On my grind getting guap guess green is the new black
Meet me at the bar we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car you know who blew that loud
Ayo we drink good smoke good
These cats wearing funny hats like the pope would
I come in looking quite clean in the loafers
So hood might scheme up to no good
You no crook Gosling in the Notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I Wood
I still rep POCs like Im supposed to
Coming live from death row like I know Suge
My rhymes like a laser beam so focused
Im in the ring so lean I need a foam cup
I aint lying bare teeth so ferocious
Maybe Im lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and Im floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music Im complete in my devotion
Word say it again 
Im complete in my devotion

Used to hit the club on dubs acting bad on scrubs thats right 
Mad spokes and leather 24s or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for compeitors when they see the two letters
Theyll never ever ever ever ever get on my level thats right 
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out know what Im talking about
The city is back just look at the map thought we wouldnt get in the game
Im sticking my dick up in the game and bustin in that like a train
Im hitting that mayne look at this grain Im grippin Im fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasnt my bang
I turn up the beat and Im cracking the street the city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show em your grill and pick up some drank and watch how they do the same Hold up mayne
What it do baby Its Paul Wall Players rise while haters fall
Got Fos crawling in the 54 on the service road Im obeying the laws
I stay shining like headlights and I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice them twos and threes aint nuttin nice
Them threes and fours Ima roll fo sho fos and vogues we call em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain Wanna know what I rep Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang On South Lee that 59
He dippin oil He drippin candy From PA to HTown It goes down
I stay draped up dripped out Drop the top when Im flipping out
Candy low on 84 How you know they Fos they poking out
Ice Age and RapALot Pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill you can see em if its dark or not
When Im out in the limelight I make sure I shine bright
Im in the drop with the Glock cocked you know I keep that iron tight
Im getting brain from a tight dame on North Maine in the turning lane
Im young and rich talking alot of shit I guess its because Im having thangs
Im still draped up and dripped out know what Im talking bout
Fighting over parking spots bustin in the parking lot
Next two lines in Spanish 
Now put your blocks up Now put your sets up
Fuck that nigga over there cause I think he said something
Have to take em with a clip out with the click out dont give a shit bout
Til he gets out Free Pimp C we draped up and dripped out
I told Bun when you need a verse just holla
You know how we do it you dont gotta spend no dollars
Im puffin dro bangin screw and riding fos
Middle fingers in the air you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it Candy paint with blakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it you know Im blowed
Four row diamond chain you know Im pro
Johnny got me right huh 80 karats bright huh
Hit the button pop the trunk watch the neon light jump
Ima keep folding bread til Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw man I hate you dead
Down to ride red but Ima ride blue in the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy dont think they doors Everybody know ZRos flow is ferocious
I keep a ride with daytons in the deck Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup My cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up Hell naw this is playa from the chest to the nut
If Screw would be here he said I would come up now the radio station requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a smif n wesson to buss cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real is it a blessing or what Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up
This is HTown Texas tell me how does it look
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Stepping up some fresh hard for you out of town peakers
We got 3rd Ward 4th Ward and Southside Gs
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin 83s
Its Houston Texas motherfucker you know the name

882,"Why Remix Lyrics
All that Im given
Its this pain that Im living The remix the remix 
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Why is garbage music sellin a lot
Why is the music industry state of mind real far from Hip Hop
Why vote republican if you black
Why build more jails less schools cause we under attack
Why keep the four pound in the air
The revolution will not be televised if around here
Why keep my right fist in the sky
I let them know that We Gonna Make It dont plan our demise
Why you gotta teach your kids on your own
Cause when you get in the zone they bringing you in you both getting cloned
Why we still gotta pray to Allah
Its Hip Hop this the New World Order and they playin us hard
Why rappers getting protection
Why the country aint flipped when they jerked the votes the last election
Why die for all my beliefs
I gotta look at my kids I rather smile then cry when hes sleep
Thats why
Why Why they got me strugglin why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Why do they say I changed for a girl
Why you worried bout my clothes if my flow gonna change the world
Why you wait till you 30 then try to be hard
Why I gotta have religion if I believe in God
Why is Bush acting like he trying to get Osama
Why dont we impeach him and elect Obama
Why aint Rick James remembered for classic hits
Why do we remember it for smackin a bitch
Why did Ricky Williams retire they mad in Miami
Why did Justin sell Janet out and go to the Grammys
Why you kill on every song why you frown at the screen
So many thrones why we argue who is the King
Why its over for gangsta why its over for bling
Why they hype Britney up they know she cant sing
Why a whip and a chain the black american dream
Why I know it in my heart it remains unseen
Why
Why Why they got me strugglin why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Ey Kiss they wanna hide from the truth
Your comrade Nas right here with you Lets go
Registered voter not blood of a panther why is the question
What is the answer got a suggestion heres an example
Wont we build our own airline states and highways
Fly to Africa do some trades with Zimbabwe
Why did Malcolms mission die with the man
Why we aint pick it up where he left it and carry out his plan
Why the merger try to exclude LA Reid
He brought you Usher OutKast topselling CDs
Why do half America got AIDS
Why do schools care about your sons braids more than they care for his grades
Why they hate our white tshirts and hats turned backwards
And why is Jesus Christ never played by black actors
And why there aint a MC that can touch me nor budge me
And why is Nas the best thing in rap since Chuck D
And why this record aint sell 5 mill yet
Jadas as real as it get put my money where my mouth is
Lets do something bout this
Why Jobs are getting so hard why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Uh yeah yo by thugs Im surrounded
Tell me why is it the money motivates me but the love keeps me grounded I dont know 
Why my cases aint get thrown out
Why team USA keep gettin blown out
Why the Democratic party aint gettin with me
Why they still hangin black bodies in Mississippi
Yea why did governor McGreevey get caught with a lizard
Why they take away Shynes phone calls and visits
Why I been hot for 7 years
Why the new M5 come with 7 gears
Please tell me why yall keep makin that trash
Why they reinstating the draft why is it so much hatin you have
And why sell records and keep workin
Why we go on stage with the bread with the feet workin
Its real why when a love one die you miss them
Why it took for me to make Why for yall to listen
Why Why they got me strugglin why
Got a brothers bustin why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Jobs are getting so hard why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Why they got me strugglin why
Got a brothers bustin why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Jobs are getting so hard why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Why Oh why Crazy 
Why Got me locked up in the pin
Why Ride with me 
Oh Why Going crazy

3602,"Three SixtyFive Im four five sixing
To out pole Richmond my sound so different
Im Dow Jones dipping round crown whipping
Dirty south system riding through your system
450 engine Im here to bring them Ms
Word to my emblem the top dog and some
I got to have it in the worse ways
Seen through haters since the first grade learn how to surf waves
Around here they coming like tsunamis
They all by me thats why I keep the thing by me
Green Maserati with the Hercules body
They want your boy locked like Gotti
Shawty dont want me she wants what I can give her
10 bedrooms swimming pool and a river
Shed have all three if I was a weak nigga
But unfortunately for you Im Blue
Call me what you want but dont call me for shit
Im slinging hard dick all you can get my phone ringing
Which you aint the only chick my stones blinging
Im riding the chromey whip I dont string em
Along thats when shit go wrong
Clap her all night long shell be schizo gone
You know in the mind not the physical form
Yeah Im single but not the individual form
I got to mingle fuck having handcuffs on
I aint into banging I aint marital sworn
I aint stack up all this bread to have it withdrawn
Get the chick get the uh get the math Im gone
Makes no sense to commit with what I knew would past
I like my chicks like my cars new and fast
You cant pawn fake jewelry review the cash
I spent more than what they get on you on gas
Airbags I could fuck around and crash
Totaled the V walk out without a scratch
I got a style thats like slick without his patch
Pops is loud gator with the platinum latch
Black and wild dont know how to act
They back you down so watch what all your violent rap
I leave the club with a 25 thousand stack
And make it rain where the public housing at
If you see me it was probably in and out the stores
In the F700 with the open doors
I aint a come up I come and go bro
I aint regular nigga I run the show
Get back dont push dont crowd em
They love to talk about it when you hit rock bottom
They want a problem but I know how to solve em
Slip a rope around they throat watch em choke like Saddam
Hussein you lames better take it easy
Before I push the red button put you suckas on TV
Gotta feed mama she like to wear Prada and she wont fly commercial so Im paying for charter
You see a shotta if you touch one dollar
I love my nina so much I wrote a song about her
Rolling up that white widow marijuana
It looks I dropped it in a bag of baby powder
Censorship cant censor me it made me louder
Gun shots dont stop me they bring me power
Man they talking sour till you put em in the shower
Make it rain lead on em every other hour
Aye Flex do I look scared Scured 
I know the Alphabet thats just another word
Banks aint biased everybody gets served
And my ears aint broken everybody gets heard
Big trapper little trapper really dont matter
Grammy winning artist or a silly broke rapper
Gun packer I aint worried bout a jacker
What you think I got a firecracker
These little boys silly bow to a woolly
Man they me in my city like Philly love Beanie
Bring the Macmilly cause they wanna grill me
And they still home hanging off they mamma titty
Trend setter from my hat to my sweater
I switch whips according to the weather
Banks aint a cuffer I clap it then forget her
Let her find somebody thatll treat her better
MOB forever

The promise you gettin closer to the sun you gettin hotter
You the Earth thats emphatically yes

Naturally blessed Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh

Good Day America this is Mr No Limit
So you want to get rid of gangsta rap
But what if gangsta rap gets rid of you
Howd you like them apples
You want your kids to grow up listenin to good American music
But they dont want that they want that bout it bout it shit
You always point the finger at the bad guy
But what if the bad guy points the finger at you
Fuck the politcians the media and the government
The fucking world was built on corruption
If it wasnt for people like me and my reality music you couldnt pay for a meal
Im tired of you fucking hustlers following me around tapping my phone and over taxing my money
You know what a hustler is
Its a pig that dont fly straight
But its OK its OK 
When you finish listening to this tape
Itll be the last time you hear a bad guy like me
So fuck you cockaroaches
Sincerely yours the last don Master P The Last Don
I made millions from raps I couldnt die in scraps
No Limit niggas we strapped thug niggas bust caps
I live the life of a rider lost at heart
I played the pieces to the puzzle but they tore me apart
I went to jail for shit I didnt do
Niggas banged at my motherfuckin crew
We retaliated now we killers Ughhhhhh 
Niggas slang ghetto dope tapes but we drug dealers
Aint that a bitch a nigga tryna make it
Changed for society but these fools tryna take me
They want you dead or locked up smokin or rocked up
Walkin the blocked up down or cocked up
In the bayou haters six feet deep
It could be you or me your girl or your homey
Cause life has no time but keep your eyes on your enemies
Thats one to grow on from the Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
2Pac Biggie Smalls my little brother Kevin Miller
They all took the kiss of death so I could be the last don
Real niggas and bitches out there feel my pain
Feel my pain its real out here
Aint no such thing as uh you cant change your life

A coward dies a million deaths but a solider only dies once
So all yall niggas out there in the hood tryna feed your families
Get what you gotta get and get out nigga get your shit together

These streets so wild just one call
Can have you locked down by them laws
One nigga snitch make up some shit
Conspiracy have you behind them walls
Game so foul not just crack
A nigga out here tryna sell yall rap
Feel like Im back up in that trap
Im in that studio tryna stack my stacks
Radio only play shit thats wack
They aint tryna hear a nigga spit these facts
So I guess Ill never get me no plaque
But shit Ill quit fore a nigga to do that
Man Im a hustler I dont need rap
To move out the hood and live this good
Ill sell anything that a nigga buyin
Boys better get that understood
Was born broke up in the hood but I refuse to move back

Some of our mothers and fathers are gone
Our sisters and brothers are gone
Our babies and children are gone but life goes on
And so you gotta be strong because hard times
Do not discriminate they only intimidate
Bully and eliminate people without any faith
And if it wasnt for the pitfalls in my life
I never ever woulda learned how to climb out
Some things you cant be told or taught
Some things you just gotta find out
Some people go from millions to nothing
Some people go from nothing to mils
But what both them got in common
Neither one of them is happy still
You can bring a preacher or practice still
Or whatever your tactics is
So many people out here so fake
They need to take a break and practice real
Pimp tight MJ tryna live life and do a little good
I played my part but I didnt write the book

Where your sparkle at kid
RZArector 
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
Yes the hours four I told you before
Prepare for mic fights and plus the cold war 
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Quran
It blows extreme mainstream be the theme supreme team
Americas Cream Team redeemed
Vidal Sassoon chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Fullfledged sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords hanging like umbilical
Cords dope swords five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational hand held tote mhm
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
A hundred thousand times one snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title and heres how my belt was won check it
Slick majestic broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me the kids nice and he holds swords
And his name black attacks the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck you cant destroy this
You get ambushed skate try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son dipped in black
My culture glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
Yes the hours four I told you before
Prepare for mic fights and plus the cold war 
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily calm and deadly
Spatterhead lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bearhugging mics with the grips of a python
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud WuTangs back for more
You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause I prolong
Extravaganza time sits still
No propaganda be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre murder to cassette
I blow the shop up you aint seen nothing yet
One man ran tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on watch me acometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause like a black dat to dat
Youre stuck on stupid like Im stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers cant stop O
In battling you dont want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause yall snakes keep rattling
Bitch you aint got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All yall crab bitches aint got to worry
Cant get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if Im smoked out I cant be scoped out
Im too ill I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 917
16049311
And you could get long dick hiphop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
Im Staten Island best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire is USSR
PLO style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine cant define my style is so deep
Like pussy my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit you know Im friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power born physically power speaking
The truth in the song be the problack teaching

1811,"Southern leaves southern trees we hung from
Barren souls heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating fathers from children
Institution aint just a building
But a method of having black and brown bodies fill them
We aint seen as human beings with feelings
Will the US ever be us Lord willing
For now we know the new Jim Crow
They stop search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us

The caged birds sings for freedom to ring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being a pastoral scene
Slaverys still alive check Amendment 13
Now whips and chains are subliminal
Instead of nigga they use the word criminal
Sweet land of liberty incarcerated country
Shot me with your raygun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business Americas the company
Investing in injustice fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise its a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them so we can free us

3109,"Lost Control Freestyle Lyrics
Some of yall already know what time it is though
What up
What up Its for hiphop
House Gang what up
I love this shit man
Black Hippy what up Joey 
It go
Soul of a 70s number man I can throw a curve underhand
This for the streets not Summer Jam
This aint for the fans that wanna hear pop and snap
Drunk off Ciroc and the Yak all yall can watch from the back
This aint for self proclaimed legends that nobody wanna hear from
Scared Get a gun come to peers I got none
This aint for bandwagon fans sit yall asses in the same spot
Yall the same niggas made Trinidad Jame hot
This aint to Kendrick Lamar the nigga Kendrick got bars
I heard his shit and wasnt offended at all
And as it played I heard him say I wasnt mentioned with yall
Joell started it only right I finish the job
So all that shit is revocable from an overview
Only thing noticeable is how he barely gave me any quotables
I state facts not to say its wack but check the playback
Outrhyming AAP aint showing me where your weight at
Im on my shit today you the king of New York
You might as well had spit on Biggies grave couldnt let that slip away
Im in the court of public opinion ready to click and spray
Light Jay Elec ass up thats my Exhibit A
Bitch kill my vibe is what you wanna get into
Drown em all in a swimming pool full of phlegm and drool
You renting jewels whats with all the fascination
So when I ask you bout it thats my cross examination
This a scrimmage to me all these blemished MCs
Infamously its about image I see
But if its bars not about bread to hell with the wealth
Put you inside of the bullet just to see a shell of yourself
I mean uh since rap has been accessible
They actions been regrettable this is what the netll do Uh 
Chick sending message to tricks aint get to see em
They aint even artists and they get paid per diem
We talking bars then this whole conversation changed
Fuck all the subliminals now nigga saying names
Some of these OGs I laugh at yall dont know me to half ass
To me its just one Joey thats bad ass
King of New York my nigga stop it 5
Keep it funky Drake washed you twice
Tell me Tyler that fire with saliva I reply dont bring a lie around
Run up on Meek with the silencer nigga quiet down
Then ride off with his intro playin
Cause I get hype to that shit dog I ride to that shit
With nightmares I wanna be at the root of em with the mag off
Know he love Philly so Im leavin him with Black Thoughts
We talkin bars Niggas better get help
They put they guts all on the track still they never get felt
Lot of lower tier rappers tryna rep for they belt
Nigga theres levels to this shit dog you said it yourself
But check it when it comes to control I might have lost a bit
Law abiding citizen style Im coming for all of it
Running in your studio engineer that recorded it
Yes men that supported it any blog that reported it
Any artist he tourin wit snuff whoever bought the shit
Whoever thought of it his mentor whoever taught him it
Interrupt with a sneeze hiccup fart even cough or lick
If I got it twisted you coming to contort the shit
But the irony yall all inspire me
Yall in a spot a lot of us aspire to be
We just striving my G tip my hat so yall know its real
Fuck whoever mad you said how we all suppose to feel
I know the game somell try to get amped
You push the envelope some of us provided the stamp
The predecessors wrote the letter others sealed it shut
Some was nice without the percs before Amil got touched
Its hiphop should blame on the mic these niggas hands on
Shades that they wear in the club couches they stand on
You mixed credibility with dead ability
Raise the bar like you on par with this level of agility
Old UNLV Runnin Rebel artillery with Augmon at the 2
What sparring yall wanna do
Get to arguing with a Spartan play it cool
I heard them alien voices Ill knock the martian up outta dude
Separate the beast from the timid its hip hop
Fuck if your car is lease or rented at least you in it
Foaming at the lips looking like the yeast in women
Dont be facetious most of yall been a feast from the beginning
This is for BIG Suicidal Thoughts Coogi printed
This for Nas army jacket with the uzi in it
Not no Shiny Suit shit this that 92 Knicks
This for Hovs missing 92 bricks
For State Prop and Beans to when the LOX first burst on the scene
For Queens Pac and even EDI Mean
This for the Mobb and the purple tape word to Inspectah Deck
This aint for the labels nah Wu said protect ya neck
This aint a diss I dont want it to get spun wrong
And this for Big L the block that Joe found Pun on
This shit is for Stack I aint talking a G
Nigga Im talking a G My nigga talking on me
This is for every living rapper ever walked in these streets
And any outsider that happen to think that a portion is sweet
Niggas been killed for less and got a coffin for free
If you ever been in the hood I think we all should agree
This for every nigga that took what you said in stride
I couldnt abide some of us still take pride check it
Limbsll get crushed hip hops adrenaline rush
Menll get touched so if you feminine hush
Project benches I trust came from syringes and dust
So who you named shouldnt be mentioned with us
But wait at least half of em other half rapped around
Dual clips that wrap around gather every rapper round
See what happen when niggas try to go toe to toe
This what happen when you let a blood bath overflow
Used to do lines how could they wanna go blow for blow
I could overdose and still drag you niggas comatose
This is lightweight put the bucks up
Cause if we talking bars lot of yall should shut the fuck up
This is lightweight put the bucks up
If we talking bars lot of yall should shut the fuck up

1065,"Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made better look again
I got a butler got a maid and a mansion
The belief is that Im living out a millionaires fantasy
With phantoms and ferraris in the driveway
But you see the fames in exchange for the same mans sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently its damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages his family
Encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while I dare you would it scare you
While it surely seem like Kings life aint glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesnt see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls
Honestly to me I think Id lose every benefit of all that Ive accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess Im saying that to say that opportunity
But they just dont equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah aint paid and Nique Nique aint straight
Would your favourite song about the whips money and shit
Be relevant if you found out Domani wasnt rich nope
So me being the GOAT shouldnt mean more to me
Than seeing to it King go
From a badass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may as well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip
Shawty Lo Gucci or Ludacris
Or if Im fucking with a ho
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally Im dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I dont get the chance to kiss the hand
That slap me in the face ay Im just a man
If they saying I aint the best at making hit records
Its cause this my life these aint just rapping
Shit you think of that deep did you dawg
See you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch aint thinking with the deep did you dawg
Cause see you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls
Nobody knows Im all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom but I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world its beautiful
But theres no place to fall
For the record ay I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected Im faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
But the day that I walk away I aint saying that Im amazing
Downplaying the way I kept fellas from catching cases
Wont take into consideration how much it mean what Im saying
And when I say what I mean even when Im surrounded by the fakest
From one of the greatest sinners blessed with most of Gods graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty Im always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty obvious youve been ignoring me
Who else you seen make it through the storm unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for Prince Charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of yall dont see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But its so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Theres noone here at all behind these castle walls

When sixteen aint enough
When sixteen aint enough
Ooh yeah

Ooh yeah
Aw yeaheaheaheaheaheaheah
Its funny because its been on my mind lately
Having a dope beat a dope idea
Sixteen bars aint enough
How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a sixteenbar verse
You know so many different levels to living your life and
Depicting with your wordplay
Exactly what life means to you and sixteen aint enough
I know yall gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one huh
Its funny how things change funny how time fly
More than my feet travel the more that I feel fly
More that I make now the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status Etta James on the dash
Smooth as John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger the women just getting badder
All I see is the money cream Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one sixteen aint enough
Talking that fast money fifteen every month
When your people labelled poor that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now its box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis steaming my marijuana
Double M Gs double M fees
We in every hood nigga government cheese
Yacht to Yachtmasters Ol Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat paper that Im stackin
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll give and go fuck a fade away
Living like Scottie Pippen dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble now Im flowing a river
She say my heart cold Im naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys damn what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke had to use a niggas instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the sixteen
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating Im just watching on the big screen
Three Stacks on the beat and the kicks mean
When sixteen aint enough

You know how sometimes you got so much to say but
They on they only give you sixteen Hehehe
Man its like I mean I got so much to say
The world has said so much to me
And I just wanna give right back to em
But I only get sixteen thats like a cage you know
I really cant say what I wanna say you know
Its just a glimpse thats all
Just one uh one little single glimpse just a page
But I guess Im defeating the purpose of doing all this talking
Aight
Summer 88 or was it 89
Or was it wintertime Aw never mind
Im in my room booming
Drawin LL Cool J album covers with Crayolas on construction paper
Im tryna fuck my neighbor Im tryna hook my waves up
Im tryna pull my grades up to get them saddle lace ups
Before lil Marc was Jacob before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up before wed tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up before my crumbs would cake up
Before they tell me they love me and well never break up
Before the time she makes love to someone that I thought was my homeboy
But boy was I wrong now
I dont budge dont want much just a roof and a porch
And a Porsche and a horse and unfortunately but of course
An assortment of torches that scorches the skin
When they enter intruders whose tutors did
A lousy job hows he God if he lets Lucifer let loose on us
That noose on us wont loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they dont let us win I cant pretend
But I do admit it feel good when the hood pseudocelebrate
Hence why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it
Like we know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name em hinthintit aint um Welchs
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Yall cant measure my worth
But when you try youll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when backs against the wall
I feel right at home yall sitting right at home
All Kellygreen with envy while Im jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child looks up at mama and smile
With such a devilish grin like Where the hell have you been
Shes yelling Sellings a sin well so is telling young men
That selling is a sin if you dont offer new ways to win
A dolphin gon shake his fin regardless if he gets in
Or out of water most important thing for him is to swim
And Flipper didnt hold his nose so why shall I hold my tongue
I miss the days of old when one could hold his gal on his arm
And not set off these alarms when cameras snapsnapsnap
Return fire pappappap pap pappap pap pap
Theyll learn why mere privacy so essential
They wont make no laws I break their laws til they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all I hate them all dont like em dont pretend to
Yeah something tells me we aint in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool aint cool anymore
All them women we were pursuing now they want more
And they deserve it all dont settle for what aint yours

1513,"Theres nothing more refreshing That cool refreshing drink 
Than a cool crisp clean glass of water
On a warm summers day That cool refreshing drink 
Try it with your friends
New World Water make the tide rise high
Come inland and make your house go Bye My house 
Fools done upset the Old Man River
Made him carry slave ships and fed him dead niggas
Now his belly full and he about to flood somethin
So Im throwin rope that aint tied to nothin
Tell your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since
The New World Water and every drop counts
You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna
But it dont rain a full week some summers
And its about to get real wild in the half
You be buying Evian just to take a fuckin bath
Heads is acting wild sippin poor puffin dank
Competin with the next man for higher playin rank
See I aint got time tryin to be Big Hank
Fuck a bank I need a twentyyear water tank
Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweatin they goods
The sun is sitting in the treetops burnin the woods
And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher
They say Dont drink the water We need it for the fire
New York is drinkin it New World Water 
Now all of California is drinkin it New World Water 
Way up North and Down South is drinkin it New World Water 
Used to have minerals and zinc in it New World Water 
Now they say it got lead and stink in it New World Water 
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Push the water table lopside
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam across the sea
Man you gotta cook with it bathe and clean with it Thats right 
When its hot summertime you fiend for it Let em know 
You gotta put it in the iron you steamin with Thats right 
Its what they dress wounds and treat diseases with Shout it out 
The rich and poor black and white got need for it Thats right 
And everybody in the world can agree with this Let em know 
Consumption promotes health and easiness Thats right 
Go too long without it on this earth and you leavin it Shout it out 
Americans wastin it on some leisure shit Say word 
Another nation be desperately seekin it Let em know 
Bacteria washing up on they beaches Say word 
Dont drink the water son they cant wash they feet with it Let em know 
Young babies in perpetual neediness Say word 
Epidemics hoppin up off the petri dish Let em know 
Control centers try to play it all secretive Say word 
To avoid public panic and freakiness Let em know 
There are places where TB is common as TV
Cause foreignbased companies go and get greedy
The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line
Have it purified sell it for a dollar twentyfive
Now the world is drinkin it New World Water 
Your moms wife and baby girl is drinkin it New World Water 
Up North and Down South is drinkin it New World Water 
You should just have to go to your sink for it New World Water 
The cash registers is goin chachink for it New World Water 
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Got the fish lookin cockeyed
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause its all about gettin that cash Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash Money 
Said its all about gettin that cash Money

Chick in my crib her ribs Im bout to dig it out
Then Mae called said Yo Im stuck inside some bitchs house
Her boyfriend at the door could I hurry up and get him out
Aight whats the address Homie said Kingsbridge
That was great I had some niggas right on Bainbridge
Yeah we play but believe it aint no game kid
Hopped off the elevator aimed it at that lame lid
I aint give a damn yeah Cam I was gungho
Got this nigga home and he passed me a hundo 100 dollars 
Told him straight up I aint feeling him
Let me curve this nigga fore I end up killing him
I would make 80k on a lazy day
Then I watched him play Pop Lotti against Baby Maine
At this time Im moving heroin in Maryland
They both died and this nigga turned reverand
Had the hood hot FBI agents round
We need a referee shit that shit a flagrant foul
Fuck it kept it moving with my true manoeuvres
On the highway nigga moving that Eukanuba

Task force homicide DTs and other NARCs
My jewelry well thats frozen like my mothers heart
Bless her heart lord me Im some other shark
But the way I get money thats another art
Where should a brother start How I used to pump in parks
Or how I parked niggas on the side of the barber shop
Give me some Skittles beast mode Im hard to stop
My lifes cement not wood so its hard to knock
Niggas get knocked off get knocked the bill paid
From that 212 twotwelving with that 12 gauge
Gods child you owe me money See hells raised
You got two weeks and my two weeks is twelve days
When them drum fly when them drum fly

Its a struggle its got a hold on me
The universal struggle its got a hold
From Sofia Bulgaria to the New York interior
You see poverty and crime throughout these areas
And people with tattered clothes babies from battered homes
Pure hard times just theyre dying from that alone
From US shores to countries overseas
This universal struggles got a hold on me
Every citys got a ghetto the prisons are filled
The police and the military in position to kill
And I just wanna live my life with less pain
Seems like only a few moves left in this chess game
I guess change has gotta come soon
I cant live my life in fear waiting for doom
And actions of course speak louder than words
Its much harder when you standing in a crowd to be heard
So I walk alone and look forward to better days
Im not the same anymore I endured with better ways
x2 
Its a struggle its got a hold on me
The universal struggle its got a hold
From the hoods of Los Angeles to Toronto Canada
You can picture the struggle without no camera
The wealthy get wealthier cause thats the aim
The less fortunate get desperate and thats a shame
Whos to blame we complain nobody responds
So our only alternative is to try to move on
And show resilience in the face of danger
Determination and strength to replace the anger
Great people of the world rise up from despair
Historically our kind has always been here
To lead effectively when we need the recipe
For peace so we educate the seed respectfully
And this is how we beat the struggle
Staying tuned and keep out the reach of trouble
The bloodshed the oppression the violence the famine
We can trace it through various events we examine
x2 
Its a struggle its got a hold on me
The universal struggle its got a hold
",a struggle its got a hold on me The universal struggle its got a hold From the hoods of Los Angeles to Toronto Canada You can picture the struggle without no camera The wealthy get wealthier cause thats the aim The less fortunate get desperate and thats a shame Whos to blame we complain nobody responds So our only alternative is to try to move on And show resilience in the face of danger Determination and strength to replace the anger Great people of the world rise up from despair Historically our kind has always been here To lead effectively when we need the recipe For peace so we educate the seed respectfully And this is how we beat the struggle Staying tuned and keep out the reach of trouble The bloodshed the oppression the violence the famine We can trace it through various events we examine x2 Its a struggle its got a hold on me The universal struggle its got a hold,x2 Its a struggle its got a hold on me The universal struggle its got a hold From Sofia Bulgaria to the New York interior You see poverty and crime throughout these areas And people with tattered clothes babies from battered homes Pure hard times just theyre dying from that alone From US shores to countries overseas This universal struggles got a hold on me Every citys got a ghetto the prisons are filled The police and the military in position to kill And I just wanna live my life with less pain Seems like only a few moves left in this chess game I guess change has gotta come soon I cant live my life in fear waiting for doom And actions of course speak louder than words Its much harder when you standing in a crowd to be heard So I walk alone and look forward to better days Im not the same anymore I endured with better ways x2 Its
3306,"Southside you know we living in the jungle
Brooknam you know we living in the jungle
See them gorillas over there in the park them my niggas
After dark we get sparked up and pull triggers
You gotta speak orangutan slang or pull capers
The cops are the cheetahs and the trees are the skyscrapers
See in the jungle we often rumble for loot
Some of us just stumble around high off the booze shoot
You get shot shit
Play humble like last year when the cheetahs tried to catch my uncle
When you come through you could get bumped too
If you dont got at least 4 to 5 gorillas amongst you
The bigger tree hit em shocked and amazed
41 shots hot take you out in the blaze
And if not they ship your ass to the Bronx in a cage
Into the island where you spend your time counting the days
But still agriculturally its kind of ill we blow mills
They make a killing and build new lands in the jungle
Shaolin you know we living in the jungle
Chitown you know we living in the jungle
Westside you know we living in the jungle
I tell these chimpanzees who be carrying tools
You dont wanna invest your life in a cesspool
Pharmaceutical distributin breaking the rules
You need to take your monkey ass off to school
And learn about Botswana Sudan and Ghana
Mozambique and speak of pride and honor
I understand sometimes we all feel fenced in
But utilize your mind to define dimensions
Just then I lost the little monkeys attention
As he stared into the distance focusing and squinting at a
Beautiful gazelle that was grazing in the grass with
Muscular legs and a rhinoceros ass
But in the least case scenario I did try to tell him
Hit him with some signs that was a little compelling
Little gibbon on a mission not unlike Magellan
What you caught was some felons crimes and drug selling in the jungle
Yo Ghana you know we living in the jungle
Cape Town you know we living in the jungle
Joburg you know we living in the jungle
Im talking epileptic episodes off that Epinephrine
That Albuterol and them other prescribed medicines
A zombie in insomnia frecking the Amphetamines
My moms had me smoking weed from the Netherlands at age 13
Broke apart the scene a lot of moist weed that was sticky and green
See in the 80s it was winecoolers and woolies
The Facts of Life crack David Dinkins and toolies
Mike Jack said kick me kike me Jew me
Now all the white chicks in the world got booties
He rap by popular demand
And a nigga nosey on some Toucan Sam shit
You not Florida AM you not fam dawg
That would be Marco thats my man
For biceps I isolate with one hand
For triceps I do reps with dip sets but not Cam
Scandal governors busted got damn
Power to the people unite with one plan
I used to write about green eggs and ham
Til I found out the Food and Drug Administration was a scam
Now we steam vegetables brown forget the white rice
My life is all I have studying zeitgeist
Lyrics bang now and again sing like the ChiLites
Its my right to use my power to shine my light
To function you know the function
Yo Pharoahe Monch whats your motherfucking function
I go to Queens for queens I eat organic in Brooklyn
Swing on a vine over the swine and keep em shook
And take the anaconda through the tunnels
Through the Mecca where the piranha try to ball and style on the persona
You know I keep it on the low like an iguana
When the monikers never leave the crib without the llama in the

840,"I know radio prolly aint gonna play this
But chopper goin off in the hood man
Like Afghanistan or the Gaza strip somewhere man yeah
We hear it so much we probably numb to it by now
After all its the American way right
Home of the brave and free Its America 
Free just to murder me Land of the handgun 
Land of the beautiful Home of the shotgun 
Cursed by the hate we throw Youre dead if you aint got one 
Is this the new national anthem It was like this fore I got here baby I aint do it 
Is this the new national anthem I aint start it Im just a part of it turn it 
You say this the home of the brave I guess
I say this the home of the Ks and the vets
All alone with the Js smokin yay cause he stressed
On chrome with a Tek taught to spray for respect
I learned from the best used to stay in the jects
Bought work from the vets burnin rubber in the Vettes
This as good as it gets used to play with the rats
Then I got older and learned stay away from the rats
God blessed this nigga to hustle up and make eight figures
Turned from a goon to a great young nigga
No complainin just doin what it take young nigga
I was raised in a decade of hate young nigga
Always dodgin polices because they hate young niggas
And we hate them too 38 in him shoe
All the changes the system will take him through
He aint a killer but he will if you make him do it
Homicide hell ride theyll put him on trial
Let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile
And he only nineteen he aint even had a child
As a child told his mama hell be gone for a while
And she cried still they just put him inside
Now she all on her own cause her other son died
Listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
He a snake in a suit tryin to hide in disguise
Home of the brave and free Well damn officer what I do 
Free just to murder me Naw hold up man dont shoot I live over there 
Land of the beautiful Hey hey man what you doin man 
Cursed by the hate we throw You trippin dawg 
Is this the new national anthem How many times has that ever happened to you What the fuck do you know about bein a black man in America 
Is this the new national anthem And you wonder why we walk around with straps Fuck is you sayin 
For the stars and the stripes prison bars and the pipe
Young nigga rollin weed in a cigar he can light
Bang red either blue sellin hard and the white
Live by the gun never run from a fight
Trayvon in a hoodie walkin through the neighborhood
He didnt do shit to buddy he didnt have to die did he
I guess its cause his dad was a judge in the city
They didnt want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him
A jury of his peers said all was forgiven
But touch one of mine right or wrong Ima kill them
Fill them with the lead like they put in Martin Luther Kings head
Like they killed Malcolm X Edgar Hoover did that
You can catch me in the hood where they shootin niggas at
They dont know if Neighborhood or the Hoovers did that
Whether Piru or VLs or GDs wit me
We down to uprise from the OGs to peewees
Home of the brave and free Dont get it fucked up 
Free just to murder me If you aint found somethin youre willin to die for you aint fit to live 
Land of the beautiful To get somethin youve never had you must be willin to do somethin youve never done 
Cursed by the hate we throw Ima die by mine 
Is this the new national anthem Hey America you have created a monster that refuses to be ignored the gig is up 
Is this the new national anthem Yeah Im with the revolution I just aint into that stupid shit hell is you changin dawg What is you doin 
Let me ask you somethin
If the kids are the future tell me why you can get more for bein a CO than you can for bein a teacher
Tell me why it means more to the government to pay the people who got to watch over the prisoners
More than the people who got to keep the children from becomin prisoners
That make sense
Tell me why nine ounces of crack will get you more time than a rape right now
Tell me why them crazy white boys can tote a gun but I cant right now
Yeah I had felonies I done did dirt in the streets but I aint ever gave it to anybody that didnt deserve it
You know what I mean
I aint ever ran in no public place with no pistol shootin no innocent people I aint never ran in no school killin no kids
Man this is the result of you refusin to deal with the issues at hand
We are a product of the environment you placed us in
We aint do it we just lived through it
Home of the brave and free And a message to my people 
Free just to murder me Stop waitin on folk to help you help yourself it starts with you 
Land of the beautiful Get yourself out reach back get somebody else out 
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem And thats the way were goin to get ahead man sittin around waitin on government to do somethin for us aint never gonna happen partner they dont give a fuck about us

3495,"I used to be a rich nigga selling much crack
To make a long story short I fell off like a hubcap
My operation got shut off
I cant slide a slut off
I gotta beat my dick to get a nut off
Cause when a convo is struck up
Bitches act stuck up my luck sucks everything is fucked up
To get cash I gotta beg
Cause every time I reach in my pocket all I feel is my damn leg
Its about time that I feel cash gotta get it right now gotta get it real fast
Cause all I got left is two MAC10s a army jacket a ski mask a hoodie and some black Timbs
Im about to get extra ill so I went to my crib got booted up and got dressed to kill
The first place that I hit was the corner store
I pulled out and told everybody to get on the floor
I took the cash and I jetted
One kid tried to set it
I bet he regret it cause because he got wetted
Robberies I did well
When you look in the dictionary under villain youll see a photo of Big L
Fuck a job punks is gettin robbed and scarred
Cause times is hard on the boulevard
Yo I was robbing people on a regular basis in many different places and all types of races
I robbed gangstas I robbed ducks I didnt care who I stuck as long as I got a buck what the fuck
When niggas see me they take flight
Ill even rob Jehovah if I catch him right on a late night
Keep a vest G dont try to test me
A redneck police chief tried to arrest me
Ayo that wasnt a smart cop
Because I put 2 in his chest and his motherfucking heart stopped
Its a must I commit crimes
Cause I gotta get mine its hard times and all I see are dollar signs
Why should I work for another sucker
When I can do robberies and make Gs like a motherfucker
Fuck a job punks is getting robbed and scarred
Cause times is hard on the boulevard
Yo I was goin out just like a crusader would
I robbed everything that moved in the neighborhood
Yo I was even robbing chicks
I did mad sticks I needed more dough so I started taking hits
Blastin ducks with the shotty
The trigger I squeeze with ease I got paid 50 gs per body
In a year I killed 88
So I made about umm fuck it I was crazy straight
Fuck a job punks is getting robbed and starved
Cuz times is hard on the boulevard

1328,"Sooner or later
I used to think I hated this place
Couldnt wait to tell the president straight to his face
But lately I changed nowadays I embrace it all
Beautiful ideals and amazing flaws
Got to care enough to give a testament
Bout the deeply depressing mess were in
Its home so we better make the best of it
I wanna make this country what it says it is
Still dream in the vividest living color
No matter how many times my love been smothered
Whos ever above us wont just let us suffer
All of this struggling got to amount to something
This is a letter to my countrymen
Especially those my age and younger than
Were up against an ugly trend
Everybodys hustling dont nobody touch their friends
No group singing and dancing
No anthem nobody holds hands and
Instead they give you a handheld
And make you shoulder lifes burden by your damn self
One thing that cant be debated
Power never changed on its own you got to make it
Thats why community is so sacred
Thats the symbol that we make when we raise fists
Chorus Sooner or later
We dont really like to talk about the race thing
The whole grandparents used to own slaves thing
Pat ourselves on the back in February
Looking at pictures of Abe Lincoln and the great King
But the real pictures much more embarrassing
Were still not even close to really sharing things
The situation of oppressed people
Shows what we feel it means to be a human being
What does it mean to be American
I think the struggle to be free is our inheritance
And if we say it how it really is
We know our lily skin still give us privilege
Advantage is given to the few
That are built into the roots of our biggest institutions
Thats the truth in life we got to choose
Do I fight in the movement or think Im entitled to it
This is not a practice life
This is the big game we got to attack it right
Each one of us is headed for the grave
This old crooked world wont be saved by the passive type
This is a letter to my countrymen
Not from a Democrat or a Republican
But one among ya
Thats why you call me Brother
Aint scared to tell you were in trouble cause I love you
ChorusSooner or later
They tell me Im a dreamer they ridicule
They feel defeated old bitter and cynical
Excuse me but I see it from a different view
I still believe in what a driven few could really do
I know that the masses want to sleep
And they would just rather hear me rapping to the beat
But I want to pass this planet to my son
A little better than it was when they handed it to me
So
I wrote a letter to my countrymen
Ill be happy if it only reaches one of them
Reporting live ALI your brother
Mourning in America dreaming in color
My dear Brother AliI think you know deep down in your soul that something something just aint rightYou dont want to be just well adjusted to injustice and well adapted to indifference You want to be a person with integrity who leaves a mark on the worldPeople can say when you go that you left the world just a little better than you found it I understand I want to be like that too

When I was a young boy growing up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble or anyone wholl give me some
I was young and crazy In the ghetto 
Didnt know what my life would be In the ghetto 
I was dumb and oh so lazy In the ghetto 
Something had a spell on me In the ghetto 
You all know what Im talking about Talking about ghetto life

You all know what Im singing about Talking about ghetto life

In the ghetto Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto but you cant take it from me
Gotta love it

Throw a block party for the whole hood In the ghetto 
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators til the lobby all smelly In the ghetto 
Thats where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Aint nothing like the hood nigga I dont care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats
And some of the most powerful people I love that

3601,"To the best of my knowledge I guess that Im fresh
When I manifest
Hold up dog
Yo Tone its the Jawn
Its the professional
I make your girl get extra low
Im from south with a border like Mexico
Jaws talking bout they love me like x and o
Cause their man pop early like Plaxico
Not conceptual unexceptional hundred dollar bills filled of cocaine residue
Got you off your deed Im ten steps ahead of you
Fresher than a 1985 fresh festival live
One time for my hoods and my barrios
Bloods Crips Latin Kings Trinitarios
In the hood staying dipped like Oreos
Even with a Moms on their shit like Marios
From the Illadelph valley side of things
And embalmed in my words in the Valley of the Kings
When I finish yall I ring alarms like Tenor Saw
And rage war with a Renascence yall better get it far
Rest in Peace J Dilla
The Legendary Roots Crew from the city of Philla
Yup mines the math
Though I rocks the mic and never got to past
But I got your ass
Listen uh
Well Im a legend in my own time
Look at yall just a legend in your own mind
I let the drum talk to me cause it dont lie
A lot of rappers try to kill it but they dont die
Keep them coming back and feel it like a throatpie
La vida loca from something toke to this
Grand Imperial hall of fame material
Black general 215 name rank and cereal
My thing highly flammable
I bang like a hammer do
Swine flu bird flu and every type of animal
Im immune to Tamiflu
Ill be God Damn if you
Insane and bananas too
My bling is intangible
Well its the Jet Li
Im working on your requiem
Step in a party everybody scream Thats him
I push a fast BM
Black gray Gatsby and
My gats be in the
Belfry that the bats be in
A box is what you never gonna catch me in
If this the last day and times nigga
Cash in
Yep
Looks like a job for a conquerer
Top mr third Mr swerve mr popular
You kinda finished
Cant see it with binoculars
Rather have a fish bone lodged in your esophogus
You ever heard of the world
Im on top of this
Still the most properest
Yall know what the gospel is
Bless the child
I aint wind up a xfile
After self imposed exile
I reimerged cut from a different textile
They say im just wild
Waiting on my next trial
Ive always been the nigga with the most fresh style
In 98 I rocked what you copped just now
I had dreams like Akira Kurosawa
And realized my meteoric rise to power
They say I drive 220 miles per hour
Sixteen bars 220 thousand dollars
About it
Reliant hypnotic
The game full of too many funny clowns and cowards
Look
Son of aslam aleikum
Im an abomination
A marijuana patient
With Grammy nominations
If everything and everybody in their proper places
Black Thought is out his mind he on that outer space shit
Spotted on the red carpet steppin out a space ship
With a glass of shiraz and two around the way chicks
Nowadays dont nobody say shit
You dont want to see me get up on my modern day shit
Try to tell you Thoughts dangerous
Cant nobody hang with this Great

My legendary stylin
Between Harry Belafonte and Harry Allen
Im from a city where its violent and its overcrowded
I put it on the map yall aint even know about it

The soul flowin out it
Make it hard to figure how yall managed to go without it
A mic with a cord I never do a show without it
When dealin with fraud I lift em up and throw it out
I know the way to go the route
Show you what a soldier bout
Big boy arms Im holdin out
Clips foldin out
Used to be a little snotnose but Im older now
You can try what you want Ill tell you what I dont allow
Fuck all the running round
You on a hunting ground
You spit a hundred bars
I spit a hundred rounds
You run a hundred yards
Trynna get outta bounds
Thats when I tackle yall and show you how the thunder sounds
Bang ya as we approach the danger
Rhymes that invoke your anger
And I aint know the music was supposed to change us
But when I start spitting it is so contagious
It smokes the pages
I literally spoke to sages
They said its no hope to save us
Because we the bad guys you supposed to blame us
Cause nowadays everybody close to famous
But stop modellin
The wild scholars in the wind like an halogen
Yall motherfuckers can forget about challengin
I blind rappers like a magnified Halogen
You trynna tussle with the truth how about it then
I am lightyears beyond not behind the line
I will separate store from truly divine
Give me a crystal head vodka with a twist of lime
And watch rappers get smoked like a nick of time
I will put you in a body bag pick a time
I will bring it to your doorstep kick a rhyme
Niggas sick but they aint near sick as I am
Rappers is slick but they aint near slick as I am
I dont give a fly
Niggas stop signifying
Stop cowering be a man and die dignified
Im that insecticide pesticide genocide
You in the morgue absolutely identified
But nope I wont do it in the name of love
Until Ive given it my all and it just aint enough
See even winters gettin realer than they say it was
Straighten up who afraid of what
Play your good and ball
Yeah
You work hard til youre better off
247 365 never off
Look at me Im nocturnal I dont sleep
Eyes heavy bags and crows feet we wont be
Stopped I dont work then I wont sleep
Time keep flowing like a river that dont cease
In the mind of a super nigga theres no peace
Cant stop running like Im ducking the police
Yeah
Cruely how they try to do me like cochise
Flow so obese Im springing a slow leak
I keep a crowd satisfied like bringing them cold heat
Yo youre the pitsPitts like Angela Jolie
Stop stop
You know the cameras is goin see
Wolves lookin at me like them cannons aint on me
Please you aint dealin with no amateurs homie
Philly aint known for cheesesteak sandwiches only
Yeah
Climbed to the top man I was lonely
Everybody didnt need mugging like Nick Nolte
But no I wont stop wont drop wont retire
Im my own supplier selling goods to the buyer
The torch to the eye of the storm on fire
Jawns trynna give me birthday sex like Jeremiah
Hittin me up on Facebook
I replied denied
Tell me Im in the top 5
They aint never lie
Picture me in that Peking to Paris with a ride

Them doors suicide

Curb servin head jerkin legs squirtin out your back
Feds hurt without the strap
Throw up the fleet snap your limbs in a heat
Helicopter toppler dropping the breeze
Poppin the thieves for my knots in the streets
And the blocks and the priest
Eager to pump and leave ya

Dig in the bass up in the state dick in your face
If you tripping get banged by them black plate
Cracked the safe Im comin out of your space

463,"Hope you can hear me loud and clear while I give you this talk This talk 
I hope I leave enough fuel for all the minds I will spark Will spark 
And whileâIâcomeâto share withâyou the realestâwords from my heart My heart 
I hope youre ready for this truth cause its bout to get dark Get dark 
Yo Yo 
Yo Yo 
Yo Yo 
They say the world bout to end right End right 
Well let me get this shit off before it do Before it do 
Look I had to compile this shit in a song
Its so intriguing all this fuckin satanic shit goin on
Playin with symbols and signs devil worshippin
People talk like thy prayin to Lucifer but what happened to Jsus Walks
Yeah we have demented thoughts then you conversate with your savior
Askin for forgiveness while displayin blasphemous behavior
At first we seen it subtle now niggas display it major
And goin out they way like they doin Satan a favor
And gamble with they life like rattlin dice in a shaker
Another life forsaken turnin your back on your maker
Im only tryna cater to the facts and shit
Im seein a lot of questionable shit like the fuck these niggas believe in
But now we dont figure the same your music is lifeless
And your visuals lookin like rituals and sacrifices
Makin deals with the Devil in exchange to be the nicest
You dead like your flesh was eaten by maggots and lices
Weve all witnessed the change now nobody wanna be righteous
The days we live is dark and unquestionably a crisis
The Devil tried to plant the fear from when we was in diapers
And some grew up possessed staring in the Eye of Osiris
Now I know you see this shit while you sit and wonder what happened
Its strange how niggas brandish devil worship like a fashion
The signs of the times clouds from the heavens open
Where birds fall from the sky and fish die in the ocean
Now who you think you foolin We seein the way youre movin
I hope you take the time to start thinkin bout what youre doin
Youre playin with a match that can grow into an inferno
Undescribable the burn when the fires feelin eternal
I hope you document this and write it down in your journal
And read it back to yourself while overcomin your hurdles
Now trust me and be careful of who you let in your circle
Cause the Devil fucks a life and will breed the pussy thats fertile
I know its gettin cold and youre fightin the war internal
Body decayin turnin all grey and blue even purple
You portray a lotta shit with no rehearsal
But in life we dont rehearse what you do can come back and hurt you
And until then watch how the Devil will work through
Look at what youve become and what the Devil gave birth to
And when it hits the fan youll be wonderin where your folks went
Your niggasll disappear when the science gets kinda potent
Im just buildin I aint mean to give an earful
Just carryin out my duty everybody just be careful Be careful 
You niggas cant fuck with the god Busta Rhymes
You niggas cant fuck with the god Busta Rhymes
You hear me niggas
You niggas cant fuck with the god Busta Rhymes

You niggas cant fuck with the god Busta Rhyme

224,"Even though I
On my way on my way on my way down
On my way on my way on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I aint gon sit around and front like I aint thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but its funny how
My shit is crookedlook at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill just to show the kids its real
We aint picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows thick as hell
Love yourself girl or nobody will
Though you a woman I dont know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you killin yourself to find a man thatll kill for you
You wake up put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you cant face whats wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling Why you gotta take so long
What its like to have a crooked smile
Even though I
On my way on my way on my way down
On my way on my way on my way down This crooked smile 
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round Yeah 
To all the women with the flaws know its hard my darling
You wonder why youre lonely and your mans not calling
You keep falling victim cause youre insecure
And when I tell you that youre beautiful you cant be sure
Cause he dont seem to want you back and its got you askin
So all you see is what you lackin not what you packin
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you a star dont let em tell you youre not
Now is it real Eyebrows fingernails hair
Is it real If its not girl you dont care
Cause whats real is somethin that the eyes cant see
That the hands cant touch that them broads cant be
And thats you never let em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up Ill be around
And we can ride with the windows down the music loud
I can tell you aint laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
Even though I
On my way on my way on my way down

You were the one that was tryna keep me way down

Back round crooked smile we can style on em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round

You know the movie stars picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase em
Look at the nation
Thats a crooked smile braces couldnt even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale cause we in Hell already
I ask If my skin pale would I then sell like Eminem or Adele
But one more time for the Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit nigga lets make a mil
Hey officer man we dont want nobody gettin killed
Just open up that cell let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now and well now
If you askin will I tell nowayy hell nah

If you was around then you wouldnt need a witness now

2624,"I make your bitch crew shit stools
I put a pistol in your mouth to full then I feed you to the pit bulls
Dont even talk about guns
The only nine you got is a five dollar bill and four ones
So I dont give a fuck what none of yall niggas say
Cause anything that cant penetrate ricochets
Rhyming with me on a record
You might as well have died and went to Hell instead of Heaven
Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampires reflection
Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when Im in wreck mode
Explode leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in
Is that all soldier
Yes sir
Is there anything you need
No sir
Report back to me before the briefing at ease
Are you a Navy SEAL
Yes sir 
Then say it like you mean it
Tell them who Free from the Navy Seal team is
Free be the one rocking shit special operatives
Specializing in weapons diagnostics
My survival tactics be drastic like Rambo
Im strangling niggas with my bow and arrow elastic
Whoever said you couldnt be 5 feet and thoroughbred
Never witnessed the cerebral cortex in my head
How many gigabytes does your hard drive hold
Or does your hard drive fold once the signal hits the node
Beyond mission control the theory behind your thought
Marie Antoinette behead me I still rock
While you choking suffocating off your own testosterone
Im known for breaking levels down to the values unknown
A specimen with extraterrestrial estrogen
Kick your intestines in sell your testicles to Mexicans
I bring the force like a nutcracker
Annihilate rhyme hackers Navy Seal linebacker
The last Oedipus remains unclaimed
So if you buck against Free you better tattoo your name
On your teeth
I disintegrate those that oppose
Disintegrate hoes with they assholes in they nose
I suppose you wanna run your mouth like castanet
I put bitch niggas to rest in a bitch bassinet
Is that all soldier
Yes sir
Is there anything you need
No sir
Report back to me after the briefing At ease
Are you a patriot
Sir yes sir
Then say it like you mean it
Tell them who Canibus from the Navy SEAL Team is
Im the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Calling all bitchass niggas and bitchass bitches
I got a Howitzer bigger than any 45th is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual Im as different as anybodys fingerprint is
If boring is the norm Im the antonym
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging buttnaked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and you too scared to do shit
Im the type of nigga that will prove it produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian Obeah
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
Cause long after yall are dead and gone
Ill survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod
Is that all soldier

Wear my ring and my confetti Im Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while Im stumbling out the telly

Ginsu or machete when my pencil move its deadly
Platinum band platinum bezzie make a straight girl out a lezzie

Press a button and Im stunting my roof look like its ducking
Meter go 200something and my trunk do wonders bumping

Dump him dump him he better off dead your money red

Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club ordered bottles see them sparks in the sky

346,"Together we are a powerful force as one mind body and soul
Let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce us because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love combined with our strength we ward off pain and stress
Technician I am wholeheartedly in life and in death
Okay I get it Im an FON Freak of Nature
But the pen is gonna heat the paper
Was a problem in the incubator
Mom and dad was a creature maker
I never need the shaker
The beat from tape were the teacher later
Now youre the beast awakener
I dont think the streets are safer
My misery seepin through my delivery
Bitter we givers and they keep my figures dont try to nigger me
The grave digger is hither he is no kidder see
Consider the dark energy sinner be inner me
Black diamonds all around callin all the down definites
Who saw the clown and now steppin with that tall amount of big Tech and shit
Aahooh 3 times Aahooh aahooh 
My people they know what that defines
What the people are lovin and thats T9
He rhyme and make em make a beeline
They bout to hate make out the great
They mouthll break if they dont pay off the cake
Stay out my face you dont want me to lay out the fake
Flip the sick and pray thou relate
That Im incredible straight out the gate
We are the darkness but were leaving
We are the gods that are deceiving
We are the painters of blindfaith
We are the children of your rivals
Holding guns while reading Bibles
Go ahead and seal your fate
Straight out the gate
You see the face of EBAH on Tech N9na
Evil Brain Angel Heart I remain in the dark and anointed
With holy they console me when they know we
Sin got a hold of me why they let go of me Im double jointed
Im wicked and I represent the sickness
All you fraudulents feeling Im falling offending the father
I place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss
Nobody but you and without any food and no agua
I blackened the sun on you bitches
Sat in the dungeons and ditches
Yappin is one of your glitches halt it
The Kraken has come with the quickness
Back and Im plundering chicks
And laughing you dummies trip with Exalted

Fuck your fame I became the name of a gun
Now they parents hate Aaron because they sons
And daughters wanna be martyrs believing in my art aint it young
All I got is my balls and rap
Im appalled that yall want me to fall calling craps
Suckers hate it now they crawlin back cause Im tall as Shaq
And Im always up for brawlin bats
Strange Music saved my life
I was fuckin it then the music became my wife
Nobody on this planet can tame my mic
Call me crazy dont matter fucking insane I like
When the suns beam melts
Everyone screams help
Then only one kings felt
When telling all survivors welcome to Something Else 
And I say Kansas City
Will always stay Kansas City
Yeah
This is Something Else baby
Lets Go

I play high stakes made crook in a crime wave
Must be something on my face
Yelling out that youre not telling what they spelling on MySpace dot com
Bold type face rhetoric
You gon clickety click and get your head split
What the hell you look like on a message board
Discussing whether or not the brother is hard core
I aint got to prove to any of you
That anything I ever said was is the truth but Im ready to do it
And do it leisurely Ant give 10 beats a week
So fuck it Ill put the record how it needs to be
I understand I aint perfect alright
I been a thugged out nerd all my life
Thank God I aint got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night
I feed people with the verses I write
And I fill them with my personal strife
Had some of yall concerned for my life
For what Ive had the nerve to recite
I cut my grass low bring the surface to light
Now baby you aint never heard me Im tight
And Im surgical like with this bitch
Jake you know that shit fuck around and get a closed casket and Im old fashioned
Trying to figure how we got from Whipper Whip to this silly bullshit
Its just so tragic
But it aint impossible to solve
I aint learned jack shit from Dorian at all
Let me hear you abusing the culture I adore
Ill come across the hall and get involved like this here
Im just here to play my part and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
I aint way out yall you just dont get me dog

Pop call me Ali whats bothering you
Dont you want to tell your friends you and your father are cool
NOYou got more exs than the Honorable Elijah Muhammed do
But that aint my problem with you
Truth is youre just an impossible dude
You get hostile with fools when theyre honest with you
I could make me a snide little comment or two
But I dont see what that nonsense would prove
I dont give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes
I just do what the Quran says to do and respect him
Now I aint even here to get clandestine
But best believe Imma get whats destined
Be it an Escalade or a fixed up F10
Its better than this bus best friend believe that
I aint got a free minute to lean back

1732,"Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Sometimes I wake up feel like Im in Forest City Arkansas
Although Im free Im still a prisoner of all I saw
Sometimes I leave this booth at 4 am and ride down Simpson
Just prayin homie and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real feel like Im still in prison
I reach out for Tameeka hand Im trippin cause she missin
Its pitch black dark like Im in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream Lord please prepare me
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former friends talk about me like Im dead and buried
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
Trouble in my soul the devil got a hold
Did everything to me but kill me like he did to Job
He took my diamonds took my rhymes took my fame and gold
He took my business interest he took my wife and kids
But he cant take nothing God cant give me back again
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
I went to jail stood tall then I fell again
It seems like Im Jonah and right back in that whale again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate control my breath again
Like Lazarus Ive risen from a bed of death again
The Lord is with me I could stand against a thousand men
I read the songs of David prayed to be like Solomon
Gods wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men
Im a king I dare to lead when they just follow men
I see a better way Im keeping my eyes on the sparrow
Im exiting my Egypt tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me before she left this earth that I was special
And because Im special they gon make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas but he arose on the third day
To save youre here to give favor let the church say
Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah hallelujah
Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Yes He loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
",jail stood tall then I fell again It seems like Im Jonah and right back in that whale again I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again I had to pray and meditate control my breath again Like Lazarus Ive risen from a bed of death again The Lord is with me I could stand against a thousand men I read the songs of David prayed to be like Solomon Gods wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men Im a king I dare to lead when they just follow men I see a better way Im keeping my eyes on the sparrow Im exiting my Egypt tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh Mother told me before she left this earth that I was special And because Im special they gon make me suffer Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother Suckas but he arose on the third day To save youre here to give favor let the church say Hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah Jesus loves me This I know For the Bible tells me so Yes He loves me This I know For the Bible tells me so,Jesus loves me This I know For the Bible tells me so Sometimes I wake up feel like Im in Forest City Arkansas Although Im free Im still a prisoner of all I saw Sometimes I leave this booth at 4 am and ride down Simpson Just prayin homie and reminiscin Sometimes my nightmare seems so real feel like Im still in prison I reach out for Tameeka hand Im trippin cause she missin Its pitch black dark like Im in solitary So if my freedom was a dream Lord please prepare me It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me My former friends talk about me like Im dead and buried Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold Trouble in my soul the devil got a hold Did everything to me but kill me like he did to Job He took my diamonds took my rhymes took my fame and gold He took my business interest he took my wife and kids But he cant take nothing God cant give me back again Hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah I went to
2755,"Hardcore G shit homie I dont play around

Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers

This real G shit you gotta show respect
Once upon a time in the projects
An OG saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch said This where little dogs sit
Pointed at the yard yard said Thats where big dogs shit shit 
He said Dont leave til your ass get growed
And dont come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave ave 
Make sure they wanna see ya wanna see ya 
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan Jordan but settle for a Pippen
Player I aint even tripping but I dont really care
Cause my pistols in your face so put your hands in the air
And you know just how it go

Drinking on that Hennessey blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkkas nightmare trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies searching for a better me

Sucka nigga Ill never be dont give a fuck about it
Quick to run up on that Audi make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it he deserve it he allow it

Life can suck breath outta you like mosquitoes
I scooped up the game like two steelos
I locked up bangin a lot
Stuck in a sink for a Newport menthol box
Is there any way I could escape
From the bad decisions in my life I made
Grab up the tape clear the floor
Strap up the 8 nigga and clear the door
Its like UHaul trucks
Hittin every vicinity you heart touched
Its about to be a house party crackin up the street
With them bangin ass woofers the speakers and the beat

Same thing on the scene we never changing on the street really aint that much
Fiending and Im craving for the freedom of creativity that comes
From escaping into being undertaking the allegiance down under
And the way these lyrics be leaving you
Take you to a realm of astounding wonder
On the threshold of a less known way to get goin on a super rhyme style highway
Window let em see there to appear but I really dont care Im a do this my way
Today find a new way to play with a few cadences Im a parlay
This space and Ill still pace wait til the verses reveal they self then Im on my way
Many thoughts Ill lay
Many me cloned
MCs talk but they all are sayin
The exact same thing
The exact same things
And hooks the exact same way
And I wanna take a nap when Im hearin that crap
Just getting on past his pay
Im a make a new path through the math
Lets see how it sounds when I rap this way

Take it farther
Why do you stall
I can see through all of your walls
In a box no longer got no limitations restraints or pauses at all
I have one destination called far
If you listen close it could alter
Your perception of what you think dope is
Im a free mind and will leave you incarcertated
All sedated
Get a clear mind when the fog is faded
In the days of the sleep we all awaken
Maybe then you could check out what I saw
And
Keep on travellin Hold upsteady my lord

1300,"Speedom Worldwide Choppers 2 Lyrics
I get to bustin like Im a thirty ought six
When Im rippin the beat up but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him purty hot Cheah 
Cause he knowin that Tecca Nina the dirty chop Cheah 
Hes handle holmes heres a handful
How in the hell he hoverin havin hella go ham though
I said to Seven Richie Havensll be the man
So we put it together thinkin Eminem was a gamble Cheah 
Guess not cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said What we doin I said to him Lets chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked Cheah 
Never be another choppers comin so lets rock nigga Cheah 
Youre on people got to wonderin if its a for sure song
Yes I got another killer makin a tour strong
If you thinkin of battlinuh youre gone
Nobody can catch him he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if you got your feet in your mouth
You gon have to beat it up out of him
Its a lot of em and I mean a lot of em
And me and Nina used to follow them
Ive got to audibly body them
This is it man the hitman the Ip Man karate em
And if fans will lift hands well get dancin out of em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of em
Who stands with two hands up movin the crowd of em
If I aint makin sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It aint ever been a gift for me to heat em
I beat em I burn em Then I let em melt 
They never heard of us but look at em turnin up Uh 
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton make em be impotent
If and when I be flippin niggas be feminine Okay 
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions Im livin in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast or Ill smash on a nigga
With half the cash Im a little sicker quicker than you figure
Ice cold I make em shiver bigger than the winter
If you halfass deliverin Ima eat your dinner Yum 
Better than mine oh no not me I mean other guys Okay 
I jump around so do that mean that Im rubberized Okay 
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
Well bleed em beat em til they be gone feed em
Speedom If you wanna go with us 
Speedom Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom I must be the one to bust 
Speedom And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Speedom If you wanna go with us 
Speedom Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom I must be the one to bust 
Speedom And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Sometimes Go I feel Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Sometimes Go I feel Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Wait Fore I wreck this beat let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills
Of ecstasy pills next to me in the seats spilled
Or she eat em all with a breakfast drink You inspect the sink 
Im in the habit of grabbin a mic and babblin I dabble in Vics
But I might just swallow my fuckin Ritalin tablet after tonight
Im grabbin it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause thats what its like and attackin it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pentup inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured Id try to set a big enough fire
Thatll trigger the sprinkler system
And Id escape but the getaway driver
Screwed up my limo collided with the center divider
I went through the window
And ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guys wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
Cause when I pick up a pen Im venomous
And Im as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
Youve been yellin dementedness
I invented this Im the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin smart alec degenerate I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy envious
Of female independence hell with a clitoris hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
Ill never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in thisll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity that Im thinkin about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
To make em picket I pick a day to be a prick
Then Im pickin the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level incredible
Head full of Red Bull unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away Uhuh not today
Murder you on a song and then Ill just say
I was with Dr Dre and Robert Blake eatin lobster steak
And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just gotta make sure that our stories corroborate
Im a lot to take like Kanye walkin up on the stage
For Beyonc like its my job to say
That youre not a real artist but its my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way you will not escape
Ammunition replenished the Punisher
With his gun insured hundred words
In a clip other words motherfuckers better run
If youre not lookin to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one dont wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the
Speedom If you wanna go with us 
Speedom Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom I must be the one to bust 
Speedom And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Speedom If you wanna go with us 
Speedom Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom I must be the one to bust 
Speedom And Im gonna hit the clutch 
Sometimes Go I feel Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Sometimes Go I feel Go 
Like Ill never slow down
Worldwide Choppers 
Im the fury the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin fright
I flick it on fire finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall Im floggin a foe with a fife
Never forget it I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it you trippin to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict whos havin to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil I put up a fight up in the industry
Pedal to metal we givin the light a lot of energy
We reppin beat checkin he that be Koba
If hes the evil enemy itll be over
Running you down in front of your town
You ever makin fun of the clown Im gunnin you down
We doin it under the ground a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound no onell be found bitch
Would never be choppin without Slick Rick
I got it from the record Lick the Balls and this dick
If you never listen to me you musical misfit
Nah cause every time I be droppin I get bit
Im hearin a lot of rappers they tryin to spit quick
But the Middle West got em and we kill em in this bitch
If you aint in my circle of choppers you missed it
Cause me and my nigga Twista rule itand this it
Speedom If you wanna go with us 
Speedom Ima leave em in the dust 
Speedom I must be the one to bust 
Speedom And Im gonna hit the clutch

1953,"Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Ive been thinking bout Ive been thinking bout
Ive been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love feel I need another dose
I know its a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice where did the king go wrong
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls I need your warm
The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so Im a keep dreaming on
Its kind of like The Breakup with Jen and Vince Vaughn
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
They say you dont know know know what you got
Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such yo a lot but the feelings not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasnt able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess its only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
The Chicago Kansas concert in Boston has been changed to the Kansas Boston concert in Chicago

This is my time this is my hour
This is my pain this is my name this is my power
If its my reign then its my shower
This pole position I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Dope boys block bleeders gold diggers dont stop either
Motivation is misguided if you hit the mark then its not needed
Carry on like a carry on on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me daddy from a complex
Cause her mothers fucker wouldnt marry mom
No excuses no regard step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And Im speaking Spanish like Don Omar
But Im King Push this king push
I rap nigga bout trap niggas I dont sing hooks
Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eyechart
But thats my fault my details of the sidewalk
For 11 years we seen better years
We was sellin birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress
Cause Im King Push still King Push
I rap nigga bout trap niggas I dont sing hooks ah
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle insult ya
They name dropping bout Caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Lets have another look just get a little closer
Rage against the machine black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta inside track on the G rap poster
Best Dboy all Im missing is a dash
Difference tween me and Hova
But Im King Push still King Push
I rap nigga bout trap niggas I dont sing hooks ah

1330,"Cruising down the river dancing till your feet got numb cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement parkah memories of BobLo Island
All is your world aint nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut Just jealous of everybody thats headed out on that BobLo boat It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks Aw man I wish I was joining youa little cheese and crackers a little Cana wine a little Riunite on ice some Harveys Bristol Creambut lets do this only on Smooth FMÂ 
Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this handmedownshit I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me antibitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back fore I was born
Pop told stories bout it that would last for hourslong
And as a family we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the BobLo boat
Uh on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the BobLo boat
Thats where I lost my virginity no condom though
Thats when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the BobLo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics thoughBobLo boat
Hey hey hey lil Craig come here Aye hit this nigga Nigga dont worry bout what the fuck it is just drink
Yeah yeah yeah
Some of my better times I shared with you
I shared with you yeah
Shit all of my better days I shared with you
I shared with you shit
And now I gotta wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up
Shit stuck inside a rat race fuck 
Rat race fuck fuck 
Wake up wake up wake up wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race fuck 
Yeah look
Twist the cap lift the bottle back swig it
Dig it teninch rims on my mamas Civic
Teninch woofers in the trunk to be specific
They bump rattle the license plate plus the windows tinted
Dont even give a fuck that its dented bitch Im the man now
Im rolling driving it slow as if its stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci lets check her
Double Ds like doubledeckers I wanna sex her
But these keys dont come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college Im under pressure
Im not a real nigga til I undress her I gotta press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My reallife trauma
Plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but thats insane it couldnt be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap you never heard it better
Give me a sec I murder sectors prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it but it spill out I gotta chill out
Say Fuck the world and never pull out
We had no BobLo boat
But I could note those times just like a Bible quote
BC before cell phones the first time I would smoke
I was six years old but thats for another chapter
Thats for another story to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking bout dumb days
Thinking bout dumb days
This is 808Ray

1311,"Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasnt suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Aint gotta say a word I already know it
Even if you scared to death its ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you dont wanna blow it
And I wouldnt be surprised if I did thats typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me her body is a work of art
Theres a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together well never have to see em again
I love you
You and I you and I seem crazy
I would die if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn bout us
Where we go I dont know the future
I just know I dont wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love on love
Ive been with every woman in this world except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
Were both broken pieces both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage its a carryon
So in life without I couldnt conceive
I tried to dump her one time but she wouldnt leave
And I aint want her to so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldnt breathe
Been trough the run around took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passions unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down we had to gel
I love you
You and I you and I seem crazy
I would die if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn bout us
Where we go I dont know the future
I just know I dont wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love on love
Ive been with every type of woman some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens but I aint mad at them
You make bittersweet today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldnt last when that crash begun
Some played it cool but wasnt half as fun
Some aint over me they just blame away
Some I ruined myself others came that way
Some were modelesque left started gaining weight
Other waited to gain but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love dont know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you so its ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If Imma take a chance on love I thank God he let me take it with you

2921,"Youre beautiful you know that Uhhuh
Do you know that Yes
You do Uhhuh
You know when those kids tease you Uhhuh
Dont you ever worry about that because youre very beautiful
Do you know youre beautiful Uhhuh
Are you ready Ma I love you
I love you
He pushed down and called her black and ugly
She asked Why must you tease me
He laughed at her said Youre from Africa your hair is peasy
Your skin is dark and greasy and plus you are so beneath me
Please trust me it wasnt easy for Diamond it scarred her deeply
Plays like a Fender bass
To myself thought how much does gender play
Rememberin such hatred at this tender age
If I could send a mental page my thoughts would end the rage
Reminiscent of the looks to her in class I gave my eyes would say
Hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
If you hold on thingsll change
So come on be strong
And hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
As you grow strong thingsll change
No pain No more pain no gain No more pain 
Please be willin to fight for your will
Despite writings from William Lynch
Millions tried to rise like helium
But died in the fields and the trenches
Cries from the killing is senseless
Eyes to the ceiling it quenches
A thirst and a feeling thats endless
The prize like a rain that wrenches the soul
And cleanses your mind from white picketed fences
Heads up your ass splinters in face mentally ridin benches
The masters pastors disastrous but fascist bastards
They crafted this hazardous plan
That still has us broken and battered
We shoulder the struggle with the weight of a boulder
That muffles the sound of provocative thinking
The pieces of puzzles incompleted only deleted
To be pushed to the back of your mind
Like a hairline that has receded
Now we repeated the process but never weeded the problem out
Heeded the warnings but never proceeded to solve it
No forward progress its obvious the soul is gone
I meditate and pray that these words will somehow allow you to
Hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
If you hold on thingsll change
So come on be strong
And hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
As you grow strong thingsll change
No pain No more pain no gain No more pain 
See now Diamond is priceless
Timeless how she maneuvers like Heimlich
In this new world it reminds me of Isis
She knows now that her complexion is a holy device
A protection from UV rays in this negative time of crisis
Like a knife through butter slices
Easily to anger she reacts pious
Like a cell protecting itself from a virus
Twice is strong is her demeanor now she is righteous
God is what you see now when you peer inside her eyelids
Hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
If you hold on thingsll change
So come on be strong
And hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
As you grow strong thingsll change
No pain No more pain no gain No more pain 
Youre so beautiful
You can change this world
If you want to girl
Oh ooh
Now come on hold on
Grow strong

3159,"I admit that in the past Ive been a nasty
They werent kidding when they calledâmeâwell a witch
Butâyoull find that nowadays Ive mendedâall my ways
Repented seen the light and made a switch
True Yes
And I fortunately know a little magic
Its a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately please dont laugh
I use it on behalf of the miserable lonely and depressed
Pathetic
Poor unfortunate souls in pain in need
This one longing to be thinner
This one wants to get the girl
And do I help them Yes indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying Spells Ursula please
And I help them
Yes I do
Now its happened once or twice
Someone couldnt pay the price
And Im afraid I had to rake them cross the coals
Yes Ive had the odd complaint
But on the whole Ive been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls
Now heres the deal If you dare
Theres a potion Ill prepare
Just consume and youll be human
Three whole days up above
By the end of day 3
Listen up this is key
Just convince Mr Prince
And get a kiss of true love
If I do
Lucky you
You stay human through and through
You can go wed your beau
And be totally divine
And if not
Then guess what girl
Youll turn back into a MerGirl
Same as you once were girl
But that tail will be mine
Dont be shy dear
What will it be
You want the guy dear
Leave it to me
But what about my father
And my family
Hmm
Sorry dear
Theres no way to spin it
Lifes full of tough choices innit
One last thing silly me
Did I mention theres a fee
Nothing choice just your voice
No more talking singing zip
Not a word
Not a note
Not a whisper from your throat
But
Show some spine youll be fine
Honey heres a little tip
Youll have your looks
Your pretty face
And dont underestimate the importance of body language ha
The men up there dont like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes on land its much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all dear what is idle babble for
Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead make your choice
Im a very busy woman
And I havent got all day
It wont cost much
Just your voice
You poor unfortunate soul
Its sad but true
If you want to cross a bridge my sweet
Youve got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam Jetsam now Ive got her boys
The boss is on a roll

39,"Hostile Gospel Pt 1 Lyrics  Talib 
Deliver us deliver us Yeah 
Deliver us deliver us What Yeah 
And what the people say We wanna live it up
And what the people want Please deliver us
And what the people need Hey
I got that yeah
I call these rappers baby seals cause they club you to death
I could call em Navy SEALs cause they government feds
What become of the vets They drugged up they fucked up they in debt
There aint no love and no respect its like a gang its like a club or a set
HipHops the new WWF
What do you rap or do you wrestle Niggas love to forget
We got til its gone you think you on you still hustlin backwards
Your topical norm a tropical storm its a fuckin disaster
Back to the topic we on it all started at Rawkus
They couldnt find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts
Is he a backpacker Is he a mad rapper
An entertainer or the author of the last chapter
We living in these times of love and cholera
Synonymous with the apocalypse look up the clouds is ominous
We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists shit
We still waitin for the Congress to acknowledge this
singers in the background 
What the people want Please deliver us
We wanna live it up please deliver us
Thththis is the thththis is the this is the hostile gospel
Im reaching through the fire please deliver us
Im preaching to the choir please deliver us
Just keep it real with us you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow we need someone to follow
You aint promised tomorrow so get your paper up
You cant always just borrow and asks for favors bruh
Stand on your own two never covet thy neighbors stuff
Karmas a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin bruh
I start a conversation based on general observation
HipHop is not a nation take it to population
Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan
Awaitin trial debatin how the hell I got placed in this system
Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow itll leave you scarred tomorrow
Keep it honest our motto these niggas keep it bottled
Im the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus DAmato
DJs stickin to vinyl like Fuck Serato
Suppliers who ride around the block in the custom autos
Ballin like the struck the lotto you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it reeich with the stitch and greedy geniuses
Im not a hipster but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes cause they snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth
You cant trust a soul in the biz so be careful who you eatin with
And sleepin with and also who you chiefin with
You never know they mightve added in secret ingredients
What the people want Please deliver us
We wanna live it up please deliver us
Thththis is the thththis is the this is the hostile gospel
Im reaching through the fire please deliver us
Im preaching to the choir please deliver us
Just keep it real with us you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow we need someone to follow
Freedoms a road thats seldom traveled watch hell unravel
Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle
The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water
And not take the hand of every man who make a offer
To black kids wishin they white kids when they close they eyelids
Like I bet they neighborhood aint like this
White kids wishin they black kids and wanna talk like rappers
Its all backwards its identity crisis
The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us
Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin makin narcotics outta household products
We aint workin out til we exorcise the demons thats inside us
Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves
Enough dope to slang ourselves enough toast to bang ourselves
Its officially nigga season these niggas is bleedin
Thats why Im spittin freedom we had enough of trigger squeezin
What the people want Please deliver us
We wanna live it up please deliver us
Thththis is the thththis is the this is the hostile gospel
Im reaching through the fire please deliver us
Im preaching to the choir please deliver us
Just keep it real with us you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow we need someone to follow
In these tryin days and times
All I need is to be free
I cant do it on my own
Lord can you deliver me
There are trials still to come
Its salvation that I need
So Im reachin to the sky
Lord can you deliver me

I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesnt mean youre alive
Dont worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire its my empire
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment Im king
In this very moment I slay Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown yes
No Im not lucky Im blessed yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ me
But I couldnt do it all alone we
Young Money raised me grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica Queens and its crazy
Cause Im still hood Hollywood couldnt change me
Shout out to my haters sorry that you couldnt faze me
Aint being cocky we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated
I dont know this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of Yeah 
Put your drinks up
Its a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive alive alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life

3244,"I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
Yeah my truth is the ark of the covenant buried in Ethiopia
Watch who you fucking with in Minneapolis
Somalian when I go home
The world I use to know is gone and now Ill live on my own
For what shall it prosper the rapper with creative control
To sign a deal with the devil and lose his soul
My still born first expression is cold
Like the faces of slave masters on the paper I fold
Subliminal racial supremacy choking me quick
Like the bedtime stories of Joseph Smith
Lynch mob gunning for me trying to murder my seed
So shorty put em in the Nile in a basket of reeds
And now I stare in to the future with a spiritual flashlight
Wondering who the fuck was me in a past life
Bad diet fuck raw die young fast life Same as a crash flight that took off when the music died on your last night
Tell em the truth and they call you a traitor
Talk to em honestly and they call you a hater
Losing my composure cause the message is urgent
Talking reckless drunk on the mic like Larry Merchant
Cursing at the serpent Sumerian demons
Who brush their wings against the air that Im breathin
A heathen with nothing left to believe in Even a reason from living that was forgiven by God and not religion
Envision Jesus risen from the dead like Horus
In the baptist church shaking off the rigor mortis
The borders should be illegal instead of the people
That were here before the Bible and all of its sequels
I speak to the detached and unrealistic
That were born normal but turned socially autistic
We resisted homeland securities mission
Because I know what they really envisioned

Aint nobody shot so aint no news that day
Aint nobody snitchin they refuse to say
Every month we take a vote on what the weather should be
And if we vote it rains know how wet we want it to be

861,"Its On feat JayZ Lyrics Beanie Sigel 
Bare witness to the greatest cant beat us join us
Keep heaters on us with red lasers
Now far warning short shots wont graze ya
We hug corners play blocks like gators
With bundles on serve tres like waiters
Its the life we chose the hustle
Cant stop it cant knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggas tryna break tables
Stack chips like Connect 4
While you pricks try and whip tryna stretch more
Charge less for that aint the program
Getcha lessons from the snowman
Like Pilsbury I get the dough man
Ill off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and Im true to my peeps
Gimme a bird and my crew gon eat
Im over the stove like Cuban Linx
Breakin down Cash Money like Baby do
You niggas soft like baby food
Round the world niggas pay me dues
While you niggas sing the same old song like Sadies do JayZ same song 
Grown man nigga baby who
I send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool propane flow flame you dudes
No names dont claim ya shoes
Once again its on nigga
Sigel hard like corn liquor
I take you out this world like you was born nigga
Buttnaked covered in blood gaspin for air clingin for dear life
Nigga you dead right
JayZ 
Since you was a baby coward
We been sprinklin the world with baby powder
So Fresh and So Clean

3508,"Theres gon be some stuff you gon see
Thats gon make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that
Mmm yeah keep ya head up Yeah
Our lifestyles be closecaptioned addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell jail and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin on backstabbin vultures
Sellin my soul for material wishes fast cars and bitches
Wishin I live my life a legend immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin my peers in the cemetery
Heres a message to the newborns waitin to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve just look at me
Against all odds though life is hard we carry on
Livin in the projects broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me protect your essence
Born with less but you still precious just smile for me now
Oh smile oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me 
Just smile for me now 
Oh wont you smile for me
Smile 
What you lookin all sad for
Nigga you black smile for me now 
All you gotta do is smile 
Oh wont you smile for me
You aint got nothin to be worried about 
No doubt smile for me now 
I want you to smile 
Oh wont you smile for me
And the next generation 
Now as I open up my story with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone but Im a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin his tomorrows and they finally came
Look back on childhood memories and Im still feelin the pain
Turnin circles in my 9th grade dealin cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life survivin the strain
And a man without a focus life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin wealthy and makin it big
Over football chose to cook raw wouldnt take but I did
And after all my mommas thankin God for blessin the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile smile
Oh wont you smile for me
Smile for me now 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me
Fuck the world as we unloading witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin curious Gs
Backstabbed and bleedin
Crooked thoughts laced with weed learnin
Duckin stray shots bullets be hot they burnin
Inhale the sherm smoke visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain
Strange whispers cowards conversate so quick to diss us
Takin pictures for the feds in desperate hopes theyd get us
Hit us all give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is Fuck friends we military minded soldiers
Bustin shots blindly tryin to find Jehovah
To help me somebody save me lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin I aint cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
Oh wont you smile for me
Sometimes you gotta let it feel good 
Oh wont you smile for me
Smile for me now 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh smile 
Oh wont you smile for me
Smile for me now 
You know keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
Hey keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
2Pac and Scarface keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me

1756,"You want what for Christmas Hell no
What you mean Is this is all we got
Thats it
Its Christmas time in the Montgomery home
Daddys actin all crazy again
Mama got herself a bloody nose
Daddy slapped her in the face again
Why they always gotta fight so much Damn
Mama face swole me and my bros in a panic state
If thats the case yo I cant just stay around this
Everything was fine we just had dinner we got all the HeMans
Battle Cat Adam and Cringer even Castle Greyskull and Snake Mountain
Now we sit and listen to yall argue about how yall planned this day
And yall just admitted to us Santa fake so Kid Vishis just ran away poutin
Now I gotta go and console him
He wasnt nothin but a spoiled little boy then
Little naive with an innocent cry all he ever wanted to do was fit in with us
And yall bought him a pair of fake Timberlands and put em in a real Timberland box
I never forget them boots they was called Rugged Outbacks
Mama went and found them at Payless and made us promise not to say nothin
Then Pop came in like he aint know nothin about it
Like Judy you gon send that boy out in public like that
Hell be just fine these kids aint bout to be
Lookin down at his feet for no tree and she really meant that
Meanwhile this little arrogant nigga caught himself stuntin on me and Greg with em talkin about Where yall Timbs at
But he was too young to detect sarcasm so we was like Nigga where yo Timbs at Pfhaha
Its Thanksgiving in the Montgomery home
Greg just came in here drunk again
Now mama tryna cover for him
She afraid my daddy gon punch him again
Why you gotta get drunk so much Damn
I wish you would just stay where you was at
Instead of comin home all rude and disrespectin all our father rules and shit man
The mood done switched me and Vishis playin Connect Four
Our favorite movie just came on the tube and its ironic its Bloodsport
And Im lookin at Frank Dux and shit thinkin you should split
Before Daddy come down these stairs of this basement and see you wasted
But he just cut me off like That nigga aint gon do shit
But the truth is this he couldnt whoop my dad even if he was sober
I know cause he tried once
Ended up unconscious a broke arm and a tooth was chipped
My big bro got a lot of emotional problems he feel that we was all abused as kids
He saw mama get dragged down all kinds of stairs like a ragdoll when he was two
And this is back when Daddy used to sniff cocaine poor thang
He had to be subjected to this when he gets drunk he gets to losin it
He gets the illusion that he gon protect us all from the Big Bad Wolf
Stand up to him and prove some shit
But all he really doing is stressin mom out
Got her goin Boy you know your daddy up there asleep
The food is ready why dont you stop
Making all this noise and just let him stay sleep
The turkeys done in the Montgomery home
Dad has just been awakened again Uh oh 
Greg is making all kinds of noise
Dad is on his way angry again
Who is that making all that God damn noise Not me 
Greggy Huh get up here You been out there drinking again
What the fuck I tell you about coming in my house with this disrespectful shit
Nigga where the fuck you done been
Im thinking to myself Greg please dont say nothin stupid man
Every time my daddy in his drawers and hes standing in the hallway
Mad at somebody I swear to God he got the same strength as Superman Sniff 
My brother turned around and just walks in the kitchen
Without even givin an answer with his back to him like I aint gotta talk to you nigga
Nigga you dont hear me talkin to you
Next thing my brother did is something that when it comes to my father is something you just dont do
He looked him right in his eyes and he asked him
What the fuck is you gon do Mm mm mm 
My father hit him so hard his body hit the stove
The oven door hit the fucking floor
The turkey fell out the oven hole and landed near the stairs
Now Daddy standin over Greg talkin bout Nigga you aint hurt Get up get up
And here come Vish talkin bout Dad I dont think he gon get up
Then mama went damn near hysterical Ahh 
She called the police the police came
Neighbors is all in the street
Watching the cops takin my father out in handcuffs
Damn man that shit was real embarrassin
To all my friends I grew up wit who grew up fatherless
I know through me you live vicariously
I want you to know that we aint no better than you and yours
We all needed therapy
We care about each other more
Than we care about if anybody understands us
What Im tryin say is Fuck you and Happy Holidays from the Montgomery family
Every man reaches that point in life
Where he dont want to make excuses no more more
Life took me on a rollercoaster ride
Ive been up Ive been down all the ribbons and my daddy game
Took me on highs
Turned around and then took me on lows This is how the story goes 
Ohh then I think about it
I use that shit as fuel
Then I changed it into
Power now cant you feel it Cant you feel it Cant you feel it 
Cant you feel it Cant you feel it 
That Im a grown man with Power yeah Yeah 
Let me hear you say yeah Yeah 
If you was raised in a strict home like me felt alone like me
And it gave you Power ooh
You can do it too just look at me
See Im a grown man with Power yeah Yeah yeah everybody say yeah
If you dont know the meaning of abusive
Youve been through so much aint nothin nobody can do to you
Now cant you feel it Cant you feel it Im a runaway
This is how I became a grown man with Power 
Ooohh you can do it too if I can do it
Use this Power I was a runaway I was a runaway
There aint nothin none of you can do to me do to me
When you were a child growing up with Grandad and Granny
Did you really feel like Grandad was a good father to you
Absolutely absolutely
All my friends daddies was walking out on them left and right
You know he never left us he was always there for us
You know there were a lot of things that happened that I didnt understand
Maybe I might not have answered the question the same way when I was a teenager
But I understand and appreciate him so much more now as a man
You know cause he taught me respect and discipline
And consequences for your acts so yeah of course
Do you think his approach as a father
Really shaped the type of father that you are today
Or do you in some ways think it had negatives to it
And if so what kind of negative traits
Do you try to avoid having as a father right now to me
When you have your own youll understand

148,"Darkness falls when the cold air hits the ghetto streets
Many are called by few are chosen
Whos to say that when life will deal you the deck of cards
Will you have on your poker face
The hood is desolate
Block dark as its ever been
Young and strong off rock and tying the heroin
And when they fix aint around larceny settles in
Thats when the ground opens up and coffins shuffled in
Aint nobody getting money
They just getting by
Trying to suppress their poverty by getting high
Some search the bottle for what they cant find in God
An empty stomach and a gun equals homicide
Some take the day in stride praying that the night will change
Grandma searching for the answers in her Bible page
Aint nothing worse on a ears than a crying mother
Seeing her baby dying stretched in a ghetto gutter
Murders ruled out they say its self suicide
Smoking dicks drying to drift to the other side
They say hes in a better place where hell feel no pain
Youll soon know the truth when they dig your grave
Out my window I see poverty out my window 
Youth is dying feels like death just follows me
I see poverty
Most folks chase a high to escape reality in this Ghetto just follows me 
In this ghetto oooh whoooa
Whooo
This fucking recession got everybody stuck broke
This shit depressing everybody cutthroat
If you aint spending 45 large on the whole joint
Youre forced to buy 9 hard compressed from a small point
The hood dreary
Neighbours look weary
At the young bucks who just pop pills or smoke airy
Shits scary
To niggas with one package on one corner going to war with one ratchet
The young bucks catch cases
Ramming on their afters
Burn the connect
Let their man jam them for the package
Hustling backwards
All they want is sneaker money
A Breitling and a Grand Marquise
A fresh pair of trees and some Vneck Ts
they done with a gun and squeeze
Til the cops box them in
Caught him with a Glock and ten
Now they on state roll cold locking in
Calling home every chance he get
Talking shit
Making when I get home threats
The block moves on
Young buck the street dont stop
Niggas selling whipped up rock
The fiends wont cop
Try to switch they hustle to weed the tree wont pop
Theres just more of it this shit dont end
I seen niggas lose they life playing dice and skin
Theyll get the same money over
Lose it twice again
Theres a war going on outside nobodys safe from
You either make a way or take one
Yeah I just know what I know
The ghetto
Out my window I see poverty out my window 
Youth is dying feels like death just follows me
I see poverty
Most folks chase a high to escape reality in this ghetto just follows me 
In this ghetto oooh whoooa

134,"Okay Ace one last question before we wrap this one up is
Considering how long youve been in the game all the places you been
And all the songs that youve done and all the cats youve worked with
Is there anything that youd do differently
What I mean to say is do you have any regrets
If I never recorded another song
If I was wrong and nothin I spitted was ever strong No Regrets 
If I never perform at another venue
If this genuine love doesnt continue No Regrets 
If none of my records was ever sold
If I fold and never see platinum or even gold No Regrets 
If no one ever again can recall if I stalled
And start workin part time at the mall No Regrets 
If theres no more shows for be to dabble in
No more travelin even the show in Maryland
If none of my songs that ever been never spin
In heavy rotation ever again No Regrets 
If I dont do a song to insight millions
Or get a video done by Hype Williams
If theres never a chance again to be seen
On the pages inside of another magazine No Regrets 
If the luxuries in life I cant of course afford
If I never win a Billboard or a Source award
I wouldnt want ya pity or ya sympathy
Even if Marley never put me on The Symphony
But I gotta admit it Im glad he did it
Its considered the first verse I ever spitted
I realize that Im still apart of history
I learned the key to victory its not a mystery
You see I got alotta love for what I do in life
And after this then Imma find somethin new in life
I guarantee it will be somthin that I really love
I give thanks for my life to God up above
That Im blessed to have a job that I enjoy doin
And now as a man doin what I was a boy doin
The only difference is now I get to eat from it
I never thought I would be known on the street from it
But if not one fan that shows gratitude
And when they see me they walk by with an attitude No Regrets 
It was still an enjoyable ride
Yeah big up to Kane Biz Mark and The Pharcyde
And of course to all of my past label mates
Hope Yall keep on risin like the cable rates
Ay yo Premier and Guru this goes out to you
Special Ed and Buckshot this a shout to you
I dont know if its the end but yo it might be
Big up to QTip Ali Shaheed and Spike Lee
And everybody in the game I ever worked with
And all the chicks up in the game I used to flirt with
But if I never get another piece of show coochie
Dont see no Louie Vuitton or no Gucci No Regrets 
No more suede and linen or designer denim
No more Jeeps with 1000 watt systems in em No Regrets 
No more sittin on chrome with them Parelli shoes
No more gettin my name up in the daily news No Regrets 
No more Lexus Coups Beamers and Benzes
No more Cardiae frames with colored lenses No Regrets 
No more chains and bracelets and no baguettes
For what its worth yo I got no regrets No Regrets 
No Regrets 
No Regrets 
No Regrets

3375,"My intuition is telling me therell be better days yeah
My intuition is telling me therell be better days
I like this tone
Yeah my intuition is telling me therell be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate my tears evaporate
My faith dont deviate ideas dont have a date
But see Im growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heavens doors with every step
As we speak Im at peace no longer scared to die
Most niggas dont believe in God and so they terrified
Its either that or they be fearing they gon go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness got em overwhelmed Please God I want to go to Heaven 
As if Hes spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real Hed never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside Come from inside 
But the only real change come from inside Come from inside 
But the only real change come from
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside Come from inside 
But the only real change come from inside Come from inside 
But the only real change come from
Yeah my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin
Doin dirt hoping to God He know my intentions
To see a million fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon be a bastard
Im living fast like Im in a drag race how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause Im supposed to have a halo
Right now my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a birds eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do
I just supply its economics
My business aint got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times niggas want whats mine
I cant oblige dog I work too hard
So reach for it get referred to God Im going hard nigga
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from
Yeah prodigal son got a new gun
This one dont run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball become a star and remain my self
If I fall dust it off and regain my self
Fuck em all they dont know all the pain I felt
Im in awe after all the fame I felt I evolved
I no longer bury demons I be a vessel for the truth until Im barely breathing Im singing
Life is all about the evolution
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
You can dream but dont neglect the execution
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
Time is short thats what somebody told me
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What its like to finally be the motherfuckin man
Eyes wide thats from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespect and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison you call it real pop pop pop pop 
Thats how you feel
Pistols be poppin and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that aint no lookin back cause Im running too
I made it home I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I cant explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain he was 22
Last night at around He was 22
22 year old black male suspect reporting live 
I swear to God bruh 
Were gathered here today
I swear to God 
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
I swear to Godnigga Ima kill them niggas man 
A tragedy another tragedy in the black community
I promise you bro 
We got to do better people
22 years old this boy was too young
I promise you bro Ima kill them niggas yo 
Our condolences go to his family our prayers
Ima kill them niggas myself 
We know hes in a better place
We know hes in a better place
But this has got to end ladies and gentleman
Weve got to come together this isthis is beyond words
Now Id like to open this ceremony with a verse from

2315,"Yeah you know the crazy thing is
They gon talk about you when you aint got shit
But then they gon talk about you when you got shit
And see they gon talk even when they dont know
What you had to do or what you go through
Sacrifices
Seeing your family scrambling thats sanity damaging
Gotta make a move cant just stand and be mannequin
Have a man who be managing randomly standing in places he shouldnt
Trying to move that Pamela Anderson under
Stand it be hammers in Grand Marquis paneling
Cause them niggas from the other side are fans of me vanishing
New day new funeral my grandma be panicking
But I gotta eat she just handing me sandwiches
And an appetite like mine got me scamming and scandeling
Riding shotty with my homie but I plan to be phantom and
Bumping something I can feel fam I need sampling
Not no Bieber on the hook I need Anthony Hamilton
I got molly I got white I be Hannah Montana and
Like a Migo its illegal but its grands in my hand again
So it probably aint right but this the land of the scandalous
Til your own friend a snake you probably cant understand it then
When you go youre just gone all we missing is payments
Dr King fought for my freedom that I risked just to pay rent
Aint no love for these streets aint no kissing the pavement
Yeah Im sick and tired of shit but they insist on being patient
But for what To wait on that eviction note
I wake up to some real shit them dreams I have is fictional
Unless I go and get it dont stop get it get it
2 Live Crew money and the Luke dancers with it
Jesus died on that cross thats a sacrifice
Niggas dying for their cross thats a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge thats a sacrifice
If shorty took that charge for you thats a sacrifice
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
You gotta do what you gotta do baby
Baby gotta do what a baby gotta do
Baby mama aint got it but her baby father do
Never pick up baby boy but his Mercedes power blue
Now mommy sick of daddy and baby got a flu
And whats crazy about it too
Is all she sees is lies when she look him in his eyes
And her baby got them too
Pay a little child support but whats so shady about him too
Is in the club he pop Rozay but wont bring baby bottles through
I know things fell part I aint saying we gotta glue
But if you walking around in Prada buy your baby Prada too
Telling hoes yes we cant get a maybe outta you
Shit is fucked up and I dont think the baby gotta clue
Whats a lady gotta do Bend over for dollar tips
Cause aint nobody giving young single mothers scholarships
Mama just got diagnosed breast cancer
So when they ask what shes gonna do her best answer
Is I dont know gotta do what I gotta do
And I dont know about your bills but the ones I got are due
People always wanna try and tell you what you gotta do
But theres a difference in what those who dont and those who got it do
Its called sacrifices hate to see my man gone
Bail was like a pop fly just to bring my man home
Cant just leave him out there
Gotta believe in yourself even when theres doubt there yeah
Jesus died on that cross thats a sacrifice
Niggas dying for their cross thats a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge thats a sacrifice
If shorty took that charge for you thats a sacrifice
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby

Good afternoon everyone Im Kenny Powers If youre here and youre someone Shane cared about or someone Shane loved Or maybe youre just somebody who has no business being here at all whos just here because you think its gonna make you more popular You know Shane and I used to fuck around big time We fuckin partied hard Wed ride our vehicles around Slay ass
My condolences my condolences
Whole family in mourning send my condolences
My condolences crazy I just spoke to him
Courtney dropping drinks all in Hooters
She losin focus shit
Dont send a text I dont care yall mad
Shit I waited 5 days nigga where yall at
For real Im calling Stunna
Cause all Summer 16 aint heard a hot 16 bout all Summer
Awareness is high say attention Im seeking
Since Im reaching its offensive theyre convinced Im a demon
Such a thin disagreement son my kin for a reason
Killing you is expected of me I dont win an achievement
Somebody pinch me Im dreaming take this mental reprievement
Since I know the nigga I know this aint the man that Im seein
I heard it straight from the Bamas mouth he wont pull a hammer out
Wasnt you at Hovs show scared to pull the camera out
Im seeing habits switch magic tricks
You froggy behind that Apple fix
The passiveness in your manner I might react to it
Automatic shit
Ratchet kids at your crib that cant even spell Calabasas bitch
So I take all the guns load half the clips
I just notice you run we mention half the Clipse
Ill save that for another time Ill get back to it
Im kinda shocked to look at what weve advanced to
Knew itd get you dismantled knew the issues I ran through
Sick of the scandal or maybe I just misunderstand you
I kept it a buck thought that that was shit you could handle
You said that you wondered if anything you doin was brand new right
I got him no one help father punch below the belt
Introspection means dig deep lets look below the wealth
I wanna know myself
How you tell bitches know they self
When you dont even know yourself
You wouldnt know yourself
Say he Canadian maybe Asian Croatian
Be sounding like his Jamaican friends depend on what state he in
I think you rap good but you a movie star
So that owls appropriate we dont know who you are
Where did the boys brain change Was it the club scene
Now you sound like you use people and love things
But later for how you use people and love things
The entendres that upswing when I call you drug king
That record contract leaves a lot to exam
Never dealt drugs in his life but sold a lotta gram
Thats too much baking soda good thing my break is over
They thinking cause my paper lower this for Rage to blow up
Or maybe they just woke up
You leverage your celeb taking waves over
Thats territorial takeover
Maybe he thinks nobody notices
Gucci wasnt home two seconds before you rode his dick
Bodied Versace flows copy that he stole
Ay dios mio sorry Migos adios amigo
Was that your plot all along
Why you aint do that vid with Fetty but you hopped on the song
No really we want a Party album
But you keep stealing all of Partys album
To go and put it on your party album
Its plenty reason to slay you
Kept going up Tuesdays and now The Weeknd just hates you
Are you lifeless Sound like a zombie on the track
Remember Started From the Bottom it was Zombie on the Track
Know who else started from the bottom Zombie on the Track
How come after that joint I dont see Zombie on a track
Im from Jersey so Zombie I got your back
Be alarmed the real is finally back
Get your guard up now hope your heart up now
Battery in him lets see if he get charged up now
Im wake
Im wake
We at the wake
Whos Goose and whos Tom Cruise
Well now that Shane is dead I guess we know who is Goose Shane is Goose Cause in that motion picture Goose dies so Shane is dead so he would be Goose

2381,"Ive heard whispers about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry
Well the irony of this of course is that this money which is in the billions is coming from your country You see you are the major purchaser of our national product which is of course cocana
Cocaine On one hand youre saying the United States government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets At the same time we are doing business with the very same government that is flooding our streets with cocaine
Mm mm si si Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this tragicomedy
Oigan ustedes ahi Ustedes trabajando Sigan trabajando carajo
Oye Luis Cundo van a terminar
Ahorita
Bueno que se apuren los burros Ahorita viene el camin apra diles
Ahorita van a venir para recoger los productos aprate
Im on the border of Bolivia working for pennies
Treated like a slave the coca fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution Revolucion looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away I know theyd probably murder my moms
So I pray to Jes Cristo when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine paste and play my position
Ok listen Juan Valdez just get me my product
Before we chop off your hands for workers misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids I need these bricks
Forty tons in total let me test it indeed I 
Shit this is good pass me a tissue
And dont worry about them I paid off the official
Yo it dont come as a challenge Im the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a Third World fascist state lock the nation
With 90 of the wealth in 10 of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine youll see
Honey Im home
Never mind why your bank accounts suddenly grown its What 
Funny were so out of this debt from this money we owe would you
Run if I told you that I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school and to keep our tummies swollen Whoa 
Come on our fucking home was built on a foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of their souls of course this countrys running coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the ones who know
The CIA conducts the flow for these young hustlers that lust for dough
I dont work in the hood Hit my connect Thats
Whats really good They supply work to the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up
Scrutinized like we inferior Petrified when we meet in my area Calm down 
My dudes dont shoot until I say so You got the loot
Give me the YayYay like Ice Cube so dont play with
My llello
We wont stop for you bastards
My street scramblers chop it and bag it
Taking pictures and tapping phones
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Fast to cuff or blast the fo
On any hustler stacking dough Get on the ground 
Theres probably crack or blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
Ill gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us cause we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting popped with weight The prison sentence is due
Make the call and then leave with two kis out the evidence room
With my fame truck boat or plane they watching you
You think you got work They copping too
We control blocks they lock countries and own companies
We had nice cars and sneaker money
Now theres players out there talkin bout they holding
With bugs in their house like they down South with windows open
Your dough aint longyou wrongyou take shorts and soon
Fedsll be up in your mouth like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush live plush off coke bread
Soon youll be in a cell with me like Jenny Lopez
In a school I was a bully now life is fully a joke
I keep afloat on a boat for Peruvian coke
Players do favors for governors and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears you bigmouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

Bring it on if you think you can hang

A brand new rendition of style that I have
Itll only take a moment of your time four minutes
Then it will be beneficial when it is replenished
But then again you might never return
To the shit youre hearing on the radio get burned
I have a dream one day we will get to the promised land
Then the president will be me
The government will be Shabaam Mos and Kweli thats it

And Im trying to win

3049,"What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change
I just feel like you broke a promise to me
Only hurt cause I thought you were being honest with me
So Im gon try and do this honorably
Without the sponsoring fee whats most alarming to me
This so emotional for you robust such the calm in me
Easy to put off notes in thugs harmony
Speak to his insecurity acting so irresponsibly
And its further impacted by the fact that you respond to me
See some of us know you as Jimmy barely old
He had the baby belly fro nigga was frail up in his clothes
Barely got a hold and its seeming very outta control
Wish we could go back and grab the blackberry with the scroll oh
Yeah Aubrey thats the one we trusted
Not this new Aubrey with his stomach sculpted
Im disgusted youre such a fuckin incumbent
Cant govern trust in the public becoming a fucking puppet
Its bigger than rap battles a word for the digital cash castle Dont let a glitch in the Mac crash you
Unrelaxed wearing political straps tackled
Now clash paths with dad the original bad apple
I know where you at shit I was there too
When shit was happening fast word I got scared too
Impossible feats impossible to sleep
Making promises impossible to keep like
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change
Listen alert the niggas that handle you
You fill up tour seats but you raw meat to the animals
Doggy to cannibal morning coffee and sandal shoes
Cant get this energy off me it isnt tangible
This shit is greater than me Pitchfork and Fader agree
Complex Im waiting to see this between us A and B
You on the cusp Rated G film I aint paying to see
Im patiently waiting with please
Thought you would take it in breathe
Blatantly seein his whole channel real AE
Hard to sound empty inside and fill a vacancy
Get some advice come over kick it and vibe
Im here with hotels strippers Odell all that shit that you like
Well light some candles and some hookah
Hookers flickin the lights
Well play Aaliyahs greatest hits youll get all tickled inside
My nigga Its no wonder youre losing all your friends
Poster child now for all that you had a wall against
And tell your mans Ill be seeing him soon
He marched you right into this madness I got reason to assume
I creep in his room sweeper consumed
Now his region of doom aint the legion of boom its just me with a broom
Afterward Im thinking we can resume a lesson in speaking too soon
How is it too late if Im reading ya tomb
Its not boys inordinate ploys and ornaments
Show up at party next door with a noise ordinance
So off the hook of me maybe yall should be shook of me
Should know Id kill him at even the slightest push of me
And when his team press up shirts Ill help em push a tee Should it read he pressed buttons but wouldnt push a tee
Gotta be buggin maybe he dunno where Pusha be
Or when Pusha push the agenda he isnt pushed to see
If pushed to the streets I see wood in your physique
Thinking you misunderstood my hood this isnt Meek nigga
This aint a standard that you couldnt meet
Just from your views you prolly couldnt see
Thats cool that kind of success you could never plan for it
Heard the question nigga Ima help you answer it
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change
What am I afraid of

3358,"Yo summer time holdin the nine split the Vega in half
Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin hide your rocks hydraulic
The kid with the most knowledge will obtain and touch top dollars
Hold me down hand me my cake
Dust and bake activate
Fuck your corny debates
Im like cake or maybe like ten thousand dollar rabbits
The kid walked through switch up his accent now Im from Paris
Cash the bill frozen elements in gold
Signs from the most high causes me to break the mold
How the fuck was yall niggas thinkin
You think I fell off the ledge
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead
Never impossible pull out black burners like tonsils
Two Galants hittin if we got to
Bustin at yall niggas daily wall to wall hawkin
Suckin your teeth cause God chaintalkin
Like Ghostface this Ghostface that Ghost sold crack
Now his revelations spoken through rap
Veloured down like the Sheikh of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans Michael Davis its me against housing
Extraordinary problack sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks Apollo rap Frederick Douglass
You know what Aiyo fuck this
Aiyo how can I move the crowd
First of all aint no mistakes allowed
Heres the instructions put it together
Its simple aint it Well quite clever
Marvin Marvin you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin ugh
2Pac Biggie ohhhh how we miss you so
We want yall both to know
We really love you sooo
Aiyo Im Gucci down Wally boots Jamaican hat long 4pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Dont speak much deluxe plush imaginations
Hold a note like Willie Hutch
You mightve bumped into me on the Rikers bus
Weed in my cheeks gem in my beauty sleep sleeve
Dead serious knowledge by 2 triple geese
Come on we juggle mics
Three Card Molly amps advance to the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night Jamaica
Came through in a booger green 68 Pacer
Mad paper high as a fuck truck
Two rappers got stuck that night I aint saying no names
They know who thank you for the chains
Outdoor event New Years Eve Cali weed
30 seconds til we tear and decease
Quick call my seeds dipped in the crowd
The ho spotted me he knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly we exactly
Formed like Christ and his disciples
Black fatigues lethalfaced doonie he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook
Your favorite rappers droppin they drinks
On the low tuckin they links we made eighty off the books
One of the illest since Magic Johnson no disrespect
But metaphorsll keep me out the projects
Rap connectsll keep me correct
Aiyo I wrote this on Donnie roof after his funeral on one knee
Thinkin his killers followin me
So to my nigga Donnie up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here
You got beer weed guns AIDS
All these obstacles its hard to make it nowadays
Whys the Devil winnin Some say its our fault
If thats the answer you know smokin cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin cause thats how they rewind
Yall know how we dine we dont eat swine
And we dont drink wine
If you dont bring me some motherfuckin cognac Ill kill you
I cant feel you aint in my senses and you aint in my dollars
I fuck with rottweilers no leashes no collars brolic scholars
Thats Ghost Deini

1487,"What can I do
What can I do to make it better
Yeah yeah
I thank the Lord for every morning he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining theres a cloud in the sky
Lettin me know that at any moment there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is there still can be pain
Down the park I hear the sirens just a screamin away
And then the inevitable happens the end of them days
As sad as it sounds but thats the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth will taketh away will taketh away 
I live and I learn I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer cause eventually Ill stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest
Do you hear them crying
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears someone like you and me 
Take away their fears
And then a child is born
Bloody naked clingin to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams babys alive 
At the same time another mother murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
Its hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith and killin your pearls
And sometimes I sit it down and wonder myself
But then again I aint Jesus and I couldnt help
All I can do is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds cause dealin with that
Would be the hardest thing Id ever have to do in my time
Id have to take my own life too and I couldnt climb
The stairway that you hear me singin bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin his kid aint decidin the time
I know its truth the next day we just livin to die
But I believe if you livin right youll live in the sky
Lookin down on the good and the bad the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did before you had to go
Do you hear them crying
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
someone to dry their tears Take away their fears
Can I make it better I want to make it better 
Can I ease the pain that they are goin through theyre through 
What can I do
What can I do
I say goodbye to you cruel world I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die relief when my heads high
Hear the streets up ahead cry when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Does that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb but Im cool Im cool
Kelly Price 
Do you hear me
Im cryin
Do you hear them crying x2 to fade 
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
someone to dry their tears 
Take away their fears take away their fears 
Can I make it better gonna make it better 
Can I ease the pain that they are goin through
everything theyre goin through What can I do
What can I do
",take my own life too and I couldnt climb The stairway that you hear me singin bout in my rhyme And a parent hurtin his kid aint decidin the time I know its truth the next day we just livin to die But I believe if you livin right youll live in the sky Lookin down on the good and the bad the world as a whole And hopefully you did what you did before you had to go Do you hear them crying Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears someone to dry their tears Take away their fears Can I make it better I want to make it better Can I ease the pain that they are goin through theyre through What can I do What can I do I say goodbye to you cruel world I see peace in the red sky I see the beast when the dead die relief when my heads high Hear the streets up ahead cry when the heat from the lead fly Felt the grief when I said bye fore the sheets on my bed dried The turn of the table the tale of the tape The destruction of human flesh of the not so great The long list of the John Does that accompany the spirit As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb but Im cool Im cool Kelly Price Do you hear me Im cryin Do you hear them crying x2 to fade Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears someone to dry their tears Take away their fears take away their fears Can I make it better gonna make it better Can I ease the pain that they are goin through everything theyre goin through What can I do What can I do,What can I do What can I do to make it better Yeah yeah I thank the Lord for every morning he allows me to rise And though the sun is shining theres a cloud in the sky Lettin me know that at any moment there could be rain And as beautiful as life is there still can be pain Down the park I hear the sirens just a screamin away And then the inevitable happens the end of them days As sad as it sounds but thats the price we all gotta pay And the whole world knows God giveth will taketh away will taketh away I live and I learn I sit and watch my cigarette burn Down to the ash it reminds me of the now and the past I say me a prayer cause eventually Ill stand in the path Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest Do you hear them crying Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears someone like you and me Take away their fears And then a child is born Bloody naked clingin to life Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin is right In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes He takes his first breath and he screams babys alive At the same time another mother murders her kids And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears Its hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world So full of hate with no faith and killin your pearls And sometimes I sit it down and wonder myself But then again I aint Jesus and I couldnt help All I can do is hope I never live with the fact That I hurt one of my seeds cause dealin with that Would be the hardest thing Id ever have to do in my time Id have to

Some thought his women friends addicted to kissin him
Jealous men pissed with him
He dont even whip the benz 
Flirt with sisters friends
Even third cousins kissing game
Back in 98 he was fuckin with Patricia then
He got a new flock of whos hot
Little black book two dots mean you got the supercock
Called up Shalonda set it up for 2 oclock
She showed up early she was shocked
The door was unlocked
She walked in his body layin by the couch
Blood was everywhere
Somebody finally took him out
She called the cops
They had the house sealed off with ropes
The next day they found his aids test results and a suicide note

3111,"Wack Niggaz Pt 2 Lyrics
Yeah
Yolet me let me let me let me tell you why why
This niggawhy we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one duke is drivin in the motherfuckin projects
With a with a Sebring and with with a rag off
Ynamean Yyou not ballin like that playboy
Straight up then the bitch you got playin shotgun
Like I used to serve that bitch cmon
Really really good I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga
Wack niggasI dont even like to be around em
Give em dap or pound em
See em out they houndin dawg
Sayin they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin they hot when that shit dont even sound warm
Nigga Im nasty my style is sound porn
The graphic exposin wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldnt be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K
The pastor say we goin to mass today
We have to pray these niggas is wack n eh
I have to say since Pac passed away
Most these niggas dont even deserve a track from me
First of all lets get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Ysee the whiskay had them girls feelin friskay
You was with mey she said Whos the sissay
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl dont like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya No hable ingle
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Wack nigga Wake up in the morning dawg and you a
Wack nigga Id kill myself if I was that
Wack nigga Everything you wear and rock is just

Wack nigga You wack nigga 
You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you

Cuz you only got them there to Say Yes like Floetry
The clique that I oversee aint impressed by ya poetry
Youre the place youre supposed to be
You aint aint comin close to me
It aint that you underrated
Its more that youre under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes youve ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldnt get the clearances
For them its just a check they dont respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is Murder Death Kill
But you never shot nothin never have never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees thatll add to ya problems
In the beginnin God created man in his own image
Im bout to tell you how the story gon finish
Kweli handle his business niggas dont forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Namean you all can get it Im conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin that shit like You hold a gat right
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light act right
You got it twisted tellin niggas that you pack heat
You aint gunning now you runnin like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin like Allen Ive
Start speakin Nuwaubian and followin Malachi
Or anything but rhyme you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio youd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all yall fuckin the game up
Its time to change up my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin if Im nice like fuckin with a chick
Who dont give head thats a nobrainer
Niggas back bangers you dont even know the names of
Imma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli thats how you get got boy
Not that Im wildin or even promote violence
Its just youre fuckin up my high can a nigga smoke in silence

3624,"Its effed up when a girl treats you bad
And later on you find out shes doin bad
And deep down inside that makes you feel glad
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Yo met a fly girl by the name of Kay
Baby girl was sharper than a razor blade
Pushed up and I made my way hey 
Hit it off great started dating Kay
Yo she didnt really even make me wait
Put me in a lovely kind of sacred state
Thinkin of a wedding and a cake to bake
Suddenly it started goin wrong
She started coming home more late and late
I was chillin at the bar to make a great escape
Seen her posted up with the homie Blake no way
Furious I started goin ape at Kay
Told me that I just had to take the ache
Left me standin ther with my face disgraced
Took a while to get over the case with Kay
But you know a bro gotta move on on
Months later to the date seen Kay
She had gained a massive ton of weight today
She told me what she did was a great mistake
Loneliness depression was the state she at
Told her Everything would be okay just stay
Positive and things would be okay But hey
Funny as I walked awah away from Kay
Inside my head I heard this little song
It went
Knew a golddigger by the name of Pam
Used to tell me that I was her favorite man
Travel with her everywhere LA to France
Europe and Brazil all the way to Japan
I said its nuttin Im a money makin man
Showered her with gear all of her favorite brands
Took her to the club so she could shake her ass
Suddenly it started goin wrong
Scuffled at the job had to take a stance
Fired on the spot tough break my man
Called up with my problems to relate to Pam
All I heard was click and then a tone
She told me I could go ahead and take my damn
Self and go another place somewhere just scram
It took a while to get over the case with Pam
But I gotta keep pursuin money
Months later and my papers stacked
One day just strollin around the way seen Pam
She looked like she was livin in a paper bag
All alone and pregnant all her days went bad
Goin crazy losin mental space real fast
She pulled a stogie out so she could take a drag
Gave her a dollar as I walked away from Pam
Inside my head I heard the little song

Untouchable uncrushable
Blunted in a 600 blunted in a 600
Yuugh I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2 I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it the wrist is magic
The left is Patek Philippes replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless its getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Cant you see my Total Pam Kima Keisha
Im aiming for the moguls why yall niggas aiming at the locals
And rap niggas broke like them theyre mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like interior gauze
It feels like still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceilings open I CrossFit the coca
Yuugh Its a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and aint nothin rented
Yeah wearing DriFit in my shit
It rides a little better in the cockpit

He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial
He tells me I miss out on all that club money I dont bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that dont bounce
The president of GOOD Music has been announced
A quarter million a year and that dont bounce
Im in the score of these movies Im losing count
Mu you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
My breakdown game bought me 8 Mile fame
Selling Eminem to him and em
White to the Blacks Im a villain in
The Rolls Royce playing peekaboo with the emblem
Lets talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix Narcos
Part on the side of my fro like Im Pablo
No hablo I sell blow
Lone wolf no Tonto head honcho
Yuugh lets take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
Its looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers I flooded the Jess I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight I done ran it off
Im walking on water I took the sandals off
Tell AE to turn the cameras off Push

Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone Im rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 PM
Pockets crazy slim jumped out the grey BM
Went to the ATM took a thou out
Then later on I had to wild out
In the club knocked some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom pissed Cristal out
Now Im thinkin which chick number I could dial out
Cause its L the Harlem pimp baby for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks
But Im tryin to sell records like Garth Brooks
So F em all when its cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Megaice is what Im heavy on
If it aint Cristal boo I guess its Perignon
If the nanas too tight I throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the 9 mill burst
Ive been off the scene over three years and cats is still thirst
To hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that wanna battle get a deal first

That attitude you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon get it at
What I stay strapped I go to sleep with my steel
Makin figures while you broke cats is keepin it real
L is raps most livest cat Im gettin stacks
While you askin people Do you want fries with that

2644,"Its a new day ya know what Im sayin
A new day brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life wouldve been joke
Either locked up playin dead and still slangin dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help my mother made a man of me
Didnt blindfold me to the world we was livin in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated Id have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
Cause we was alone and me I bought an F home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad for raisin another niggas child
So now we livin comfortable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldnt see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kids leavin
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now Im livin in my grandmas home
My grandmas strong shes got nine kids of her own
And keepin me aint no big deal
But now that Im much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kindhearted not wantin to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the moneys low
And pretty soon a brothers gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
Im in the ghetto I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
Im losin all hope a brothers fallin short
I cant cope so now Im slangin dope
And now my granny knows Im doin wrong
She just prayin for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldnt have told me nothin back then
But now I feel ya
Im eighteen and now Im havin big fun
My babys mother just had my first son
May eleven I never will forget the day
A stars born lets name him little Scarface
My first born and yo Im a proud father
I gotta son I gots ta be my sons father
And sellin dope aint the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk and pampers tryin ta do my part
And hes my son I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes and jewelry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I dont want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin to make it lifelike
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man hell appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the fathers role
Because these years hell remember most
So its all about little Marcus and me becomin close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it aint my line of work its the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybodys got my baby
Wantin to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
Its your daughter dont she look like you
I just cant tell why dont you take it to my Momma Duke
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin coochie tryin to get a free meal
So now we in and outta court
Tryin to get mo money braggin om the child support
Tellin her friends that shes breakin me
Now eveybody knows that she was just fakin G
Come to find out the girl never had me
Shes the babys mother but me I aint the babys daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin
I know that Im the babys father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldnt have told me nothin back then
But now I feel ya
I feel ya
Now Im twentytwo and finally got a grip on life
Its nineteen ninetythree I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
Im young and black so my choice aint a nightstick
Because we livin in a concentration set
And everyday we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from
So I know my numbers comin up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin up
And even though I hate killin off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man Im a defend mine
My brother Quanells tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin to take another brothers shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the storys all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldnt give a fuck
Because she left my partners family with memories
And after hearin this I know you gon remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you wont realize until you dead and gone
It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I aint goin out like dat
Ya feel me
yeah

away my pocket knife And got a bigger stick to fight with Im young and black so my choice aint a nightstick Because we livin in a concentration set And everyday we face to face with death I seen my homies go and come And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from So I know my numbers comin up So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin up And even though I hate killin off my own kind I gotta be a man and as a man Im a defend mine My brother Quanells tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast So united we stand but we gonna fall quick Because we always tryin to take another brothers shit And the cops is in the same vote Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood And now the storys all twisted up And if they gave the cop the chair I really wouldnt give a fuck Because she left my partners family with memories And after hearin this I know you gon remember me But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch I see his parents and then I started breakin up Because I know what you did was wrong But you wont realize until you dead and gone It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning You straight up shot him from behind But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act But you gotta tell your story to the judge Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness Then in reality you took care of your business But regardless I know you wanna kill me But I aint goin out like dat Ya feel me yeah,Its a new day ya know what Im sayin A new day brings a new problem to a brother And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother Cause without my mommy dear my life wouldve been joke Either locked up playin dead and still slangin dope but nope The lord he had a plan for me And with his help my mother made a man of me Didnt blindfold me to the world we was livin in Taught me how to save my little dividends So when I graduated Id have a little school money But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy And flunked outta school with the flag pole And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone Cause we was alone and me I bought an F home My real pops he broke out with the style So I respect my stepdad for raisin another niggas child So now we livin comfortable Taught me the game and how to be responsible But back then I couldnt see it I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kids leavin And ended up in a big fight And told me not to come home until I got my shit right So now Im livin in my grandmas home My grandmas strong shes got nine kids of her own And keepin me aint no big deal But now that Im much older I see just how the shit feels Being kindhearted not wantin to tell me no Even though my grandfather just had a stroke And now the moneys low And pretty soon a brothers gonna have ta go Or either try to find a job so I can help out Im in the ghetto I gots ta get myself out And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way So my family can have a better place to stay Im losin all hope a brothers fallin short I cant cope so now Im slangin dope And now my granny knows Im doin wrong She just prayin for me heavily Take care of her grandson And the lord must of heard her prayer Cause he made me get a grip And got me on up outta there I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya You couldnt have told me nothin back then But now I feel ya Im eighteen and now Im havin big fun My babys mother just had my first son May eleven I never will forget the day A stars born lets name him little Scarface My first born and yo Im a proud father I gotta son I gots ta be my sons father And sellin dope aint the way that I can get ahead But what the hell I gots ta keep my baby fed I buy him milk and pampers tryin ta do my part And hes my son I gots ta try to make him hard I buy him clothes and jewelry not the Tonka toys Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy And I dont want my son to look at life Through a replica of reality tryin to make it lifelike But yet and still I let my son be a kid Just give him up the real exactly like my momma did So when he gets to be a man hell appreciate The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate

3476,"I be a Harlem World party pleaser
You might find me on 139 sippin a Bacardi Breezer
Thats where I rest at killin tracks is what Im best at
Jealousy I expect that I dont stress that
I want a cutie with some tight jeans on that I can scheme on
Treat her nice take her out and trick some cream on
TV screens all over the US Im seen on
It aint all about me Im tryin to put my team on
Because its good to have a crew to lean on mics I fiend on
You think you can do it like this Dream on
Ima chrome my rims and ice my chain
Fly clothes and pretty hoes is the price of fame
Yo you know the game plan
CTown thats my main man
We never bring luggage we go shoppin when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand
Lll make ya dame swallow
Your ice dont shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin midget sips I run with the richest cliques
Tap the thickest chicks plus drop the slickest hits
You know nuttin about L so dont doubt L
Whats this motherfuckin rap game without L
Yo thats like jewels without ice
Thats like china without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Dont touch the mic if you unable to spit

All you niggas better come clean before my gun scream
Raps a fun thing only roll with one team
Flamboyant Entertainment thats who I came with
I pack a nine and once I aim it I got to flame it
Push a blue eight got props from here to Kuwait
And while your crew hate you hear me on Big L new tape
They call me CTown I snatch mics like a rebound
Pack a threepound thats my prerog like B Brown
I rip shows in large arenas like the Garden or Meadowlands
Got nuttin but love for all my ghetto fans
On 139 and Lenox eyes get shut
The Danger Zone is where pies get cut where all the guys get stuck
Try to front we gon size you up
Like Corleonell grab the chrome and throw five in your gut

248,"The kiss of death on a rap pick
Then you get a slap quick so guard it with Chapstick
In other words protect and hold your own
It only takes one punch to get ya head flown
Fists of fury suckers get buried
Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
And nothin could save ya from catchin the vapors
Rhymes thatll sting your face like a quick jab
And Im rubbin em in just like Vicks salve
Captivatin dominatin innovatin illustratin fascinatin
Motivatin elevatin terminatin mutilatin
Rhymes theyre worth their weight in
Gold bold never sold to a bidder
That claim to glitter youre so bitter like kitty litter
As for damage dont tell me what another do
Cause I quote that Im RAW
So make room cause fighters are doomed
Try to consume and make your own tomb
A grave or a casket a tisket a tasket
Youre rhymes out of basket
Boy you get your ass kicked
For frontin like you hittin hard
When your arms are too short to box with God
So dont even touch cause I come with too much
Address and bless any mic that I clutch
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle he must be senile
And thats why meanwhile back at the ranch
The brother Asiatic chosen one is expandin with a new branch
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat
Make you say daddy I dont want none Kool Moe Dee
I seize and freeze MCs with these degrees
Put me to my knees or at ease Chiiiillld please
I break it down to bring on the next act
Rappers are so full of shit they need ExLax
So stop griffin your mind is driftin
Prepare yourself cause I get swift and
Captivate the crowd but you cant understand
At times I gotta say to myself God damn
As I get hot and still be gettin warmer
And I dont have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself never bother another
But if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker
Frontin MCs that be tryin to riff
Need to save it and dont even play with
Me when I react like a volcano eruptin
I step to you and say Now whats up then
Every wordll be just like surgery
Cuttin you open so rush to emergency
Or even bow to your knees and bend low
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
JOKES aint my style
I aint a child thats why I dont smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
So divine the other rappers need resign
As I go on from night to morn
Beginning to end from Knowledge to Born
Whenever rappers are lookin for static
Looks like a job for KingAsiatic
NE send me competitors
Then again it might just be better to
Just slow down you dont wanna throwdown
I get busy get you dizzy like a merrygoround
Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme
And competition prepare for wartime
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat
I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol
Of folders molders towin black gold
So let it be said let it be read cause I lead ahead
Of others whose rhymes are old as ProKeds
Tryin to diss the Big Daddy repertoire Moi
You steady screamin out a antique segment wrote
As I just play em like a pregnant roach and STOMP EM
For tryin the forbidden
Your rhymes aint hittin boy you wont be gettin
None of or in front of cause every one of
My adversaries lack you little son of
Obituary columns will read your name
If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane
So any claimin or aimin to be champion
Against me Psssh cant be won
I rank supreme and its a rappers dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem
Cause theres only room for one teacher
Wise words from a wise manll reach ya
I teach freedom justice and equality
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
Slaves from mental death in power
Thats the reason before I drop this bomb
I say peace to the Nation of Islam
Make you say 6X daddy I dont want none 
Make you say say dadaddy I dont want none 
Make mamamake make you say daddy I dont want none 
Make you say 6X daddy I dont want none

Song Listen To Me Now
Verse One
I have no face I have no body I have no heart I have no soul
I dont care if youre young if youre old
Heres my mission Im out to get them those who be slippin
Creepin while they be creepin I be enterin
Into them silently violently thats not me
Quietly youll never know Im in your blood stream
Swimming I been injected now youre infected
And when you find me here it will be worse than you expected
Temptation thats how I get in thats how I got in
Information is what you lackin now Im attackin
Your mind and body functions dont seem to function
Somethin aint how it used to be and its because of me
Killin you coldblooded murderer
The bible told the world I would be here and now Im servin ya
Along with the floods mass destruction and wars
You can listen to me but the choice is yours
Chorus sample from Goodie Mobs Cell Therapy 
Listen to me now believe me later on
I knew I shouldve had my jimmy hat strapped on
Listen to me now believe me later on
Theres a message to my madness its more than just a song
Listen to me now believe me later on
My fantasy was fulfilled but my life is still gone
Listen to me now believe me later on
Im rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
Verse Two
I got no concious killing by the bunches how can I see with no eyes
Unprotected people Im taking em by surprise I despise
Any type of Doctor thinking he can stop a
Epidemic built across the nation cant stop temptation listen
Who in the hell gonna stop you when I get in your mind then
Tell you squash where da girl done been hit the broad from behind Im
All up in the walls of the womb your doom is incognito
You constantly putting your life in my hands thinking you didnt see no
Evidence that made it irrelevant Im hangin out up in the system
On the scene mean stuffed in them jeans is how she gets them
If it was up to me Id get with you all but I really dont pick em
How one by one she lures them in Im the one who tricks them
Your coffin sealer temperature chiller the silent killer
I done sucked up more life twice the sales of Mikes Thriller
If a victim want to be loved gun and will travel
Anywhere with any broad or buster now you in gravel need to
Chorus
Listen to me now believe me later on
I knew I shoulda told him to put a condom on

Verse Three
Lord tell me why was I born in the days of bloodshed
Plagues and neighborhoods full of the walking dead
Poison is cooked and smoked and shot into our veins
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous echo through our brains
Misguided the big picture over the small picture
Thats how the devil makes a man interpretate the scripture
Rotten born dead into a sea of sinners
Young girls are pros before they can become beginners
Booty shakers sellin sex to pay they college tuition
Jealousy send our brothers on straight pistol missions
And in the midst of the drama mama can I save ya
Now you remember all the hell she went through tryin ta raise ya
But its too late for that in this predicament
You shoulda been thinking of this when you was flickin it stickin it
But who am I Just another man running his mouth
Giving you something to think about my time is up Im out
If you aint realized by now the description of the topic here is AIDS
Several amounts of times I will appear on the front page
Never be thinking about the filthy hoes in which Ive laid
Down deep in the dungeons next to the devil is where I stayed
Never be thinking about the backs I rode and what I weighed
Now everything thats important in your life is just a daze
Being a damn fool trying to prove you wasnt afraid
Wasnt intending to do it but yet and still at times you made
Moves within the game that should never have been played
Whether you old or whether it struck you at an early age
No difference between the two cause they both in the same stage
Curiosity killed the cat the cat was standin in front of the gauge
It seems the whole subject keeps the world within a daze
Well this is the fact
That some of these people be thinkin they cant be fazed
Worldwide plague slowly turning into a rage
Up and down side to side heterosex and gays need to

Time after time when Im speakin my mind

Yall too busy watching Ricki Lake and Montel Williams
Tripping on like bitches killing niggas behind AIDS
But see that big monkey between they legs
Get niggas trapped like motherfucking rats
Trying to get cheese ya heard me
You out the front door that nigga out the back
Thats how my partner got killed behind some cat
I aint got no love for yall hoes cause yall tramps
And bitches act bad when they get they fucking stamps
But bitches yall can suck a nigga dick and get real
Or better twirk something or buckle up and guard yo grill
Cause Im laying you hoes on the floor like niggas
Bitches want that dick ho yall can feel that trigga
17 rounds from that motherfucking pistol
And watch a nigga make a bitch fucking head whistle
Hoes bout that ass niggas yall feel me
But pussy to good to be fucking real G
Im from that 3rd ward niggas started banging
Bitches running up in cars cause we hanging
Ask a nigga to break em off to get her hair done
But I aint giving a bitch nothing but some cum
And hit and run in the projects ballin wit my motherfucking homies
And all yall bitches with that killa pussy
Dont run up on me
Chorus 
Fool I aint Spud but these hoes be creepin
Late at night when a young ballas sleepin
Bitches try to run into the safe and get my money
But Ill lay a bitch on the floor it aint funny
Like that bitch Brenda got my boy killed
Like that ho Shell yea she tried to do ONeal
And what about EpDo she cant phase me
Talking that shit about she might have my baby
Bitch it aint mine I only fucked her once
I had 2 rubbers so bitch you done and what

Say her pussy be killing niggas think she pack a OOZIE
But I aint even trippin all yall hoes

501,"I grew up a fucking screwup
Got introduced to the game to the game then fucking blew up
Yeah Dedicated to all my hustlers thats a product of they environment
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man
Yeah Grew up a screw up baby
Got introduced to the game I aint took a breath yet
Lets go
Ever since I was an embryo waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said Wake up and kick out
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical spit the government chip out
Peace up ATown down and then I dipped out
And oh my gosh the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in even my baby stroller was tricked out
Somebody get him the little niggas out of control
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle Ill dream about diamonds and gold
Gold gold to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen
Freshing freshing and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now Im grown with more range than a Texan
And Im a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion
Ayyyy
Yall already know what it is
Imma tell you nigga
CT know what it is bout 175
Homey fronted me a zip shit I made it a bird
Thats seventeen and a half all I need is the word
Say the ice is cool but them pots is hot
You better cook slow but that money come fast
I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash
You know the kid pimping all over the world
A hundred carats got me all over your girl
YEAH five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag
A corporate thug I run with a Playaz Circle
I got a Field Mob thatll Disturb your Peace
Blowing Sean Jay all we do is smoke
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head
Whats up
Imma be all the way real with this look
When I came into the game they aint do nothing but doubt me
Now the whole games changed and it aint nothing without me
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels Hyundais to Bentleys
And five course meals no more Popeyes and Blimpies
From alright to handsome from one room to mansions
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch I bought a
Plane and a boat and six other whips no MARTA
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips but harder
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK Guard your
Women dawg I went from ashy to classy
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars
Its not the hand that youre dealt but how youre playing your cards
Boy

Control this pen Look over your shoulder 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems

Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros the cons the diamond rings

The soul divine and cross between
Whats yours and mines the gold the green
The ropes that show just what it mean

And fly before my vocals Scream

All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin for me to just take em
When I arrive my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave even my shadow got a sound to it
Cause Im the god of the harder the martyr the father
I spit a saliva thats leaking a lava
Completin the saga while meetin and greetin
And beating you niggas completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga believe me
Graffiti your armor you heebie you jeebie

See me now give me the startup and treat me

410,"Cos I aint ever change on you motherfuckers
And OGs spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You wont find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper
These youngsters think that Im so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends aint shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you dont owe nobody niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds thats your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life its a game but its not fair
Its hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game thats a nono
The streets aint the only ones watching taking photos
And life aint bitches and money
This lifes bout getting this money
Because that bitch is a problem
Cant live with and cant live without her
My advice to you is stay on your grind
Keep that bitch on her back and your bank on your mind nigga
And we dont talk to police
Thats the number one rule on the streets
Cause if you cant do the time then you dont do the crime
Nigga keep the streets quiet
You dont upstrap unless you have to
Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
You gon revenge somebody
Dig two graves just in case its two bodies
And never bring a stick to a gunfight
One shot one kill you get one life
And shitting where you sleep aint an option
People knowing where you sleep thats a problem
You got to watch these niggas
They aint your home boys not these niggas
First chance you call sleep they could murk you
So dont put squares in your circle
Cos these streets dont love nobody
You gotta pay attention to the signs Johnny
If you a weak nigga dont try to play hard
Better keep your punk ass out the yard
And dont get fronted just avoid that
But if you have to pay them boys back
Cos niggas aint playing its a drought
The border is closed the cash running out
And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks
Every nigga in the way getting shook
You got to play the game by the book
I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least when you make that money
Keep it lowpro dont say shit dummy
And dont say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game Im providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds aint stupid
You aint the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a fourdoor
Flying spur ol rims trynna showboat
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
But once you in it its hard to get out of
And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do
So when you get the chance to make a break for it run fool
",gon revenge somebody Dig two graves just in case its two bodies And never bring a stick to a gunfight One shot one kill you get one life And shitting where you sleep aint an option People knowing where you sleep thats a problem You got to watch these niggas They aint your home boys not these niggas First chance you call sleep they could murk you So dont put squares in your circle Cos these streets dont love nobody You gotta pay attention to the signs Johnny If you a weak nigga dont try to play hard Better keep your punk ass out the yard And dont get fronted just avoid that But if you have to pay them boys back Cos niggas aint playing its a drought The border is closed the cash running out And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks Every nigga in the way getting shook You got to play the game by the book I fuck around and your life getting took And last but not least when you make that money Keep it lowpro dont say shit dummy And dont say shit to your girlfriend Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen Take notes to the game Im providing Stop using momma names trynna hide shit Nigga them feds aint stupid You aint the only nigga trynna do this Riding round the hood in a fourdoor Flying spur ol rims trynna showboat You drawing too much attention And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of But once you in it its hard to get out of And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do So when you get the chance to make a break for it run fool,Cos I aint ever change on you motherfuckers And OGs spitting game on you motherfuckers You should be ashamed like a motherfucker The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers Everybody wanna be a hard stopper You wont find too many riding out without a chopper They end up dead or somewhere in lock up Where somebody will break em off something proper These youngsters think that Im so cool They wanna learn the game from an old school I give em strategies to sleep on So when they put me in the grave they could keep on Now first on your check list Be your own man cos your friends aint shit They only come around when they need to Use that home boy shit to deceive you Remember you dont owe nobody niggas Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds thats your body And they forgetting how they got there This is life its a game but its not fair Its hard enough trynna get by Day to day struggling with shit so you get high And staying drunk on the regular Talking dope talk on your cellular But in this game thats a nono The streets aint the only ones watching taking photos And life aint bitches and money This lifes bout getting this money Because that bitch is a problem Cant live with and cant live without her My advice to you is stay on your grind Keep that bitch on her back and your bank on your mind nigga And we dont talk to police Thats the number one rule on the streets Cause if you cant do the time then you dont do the crime Nigga keep the streets quiet You dont upstrap unless you have to Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you You

1151,"Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on am I right Oh oh whoa 
On the way we shed some tears every day we sacrifice
So we can be standing here oh what a hell of a life
Been winning so many years and the future is bright
Now its very clear that we gon be rich forever
And ever and ever ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever oh oh oh ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever and ever and ever
I remember bein blind to it
Til the day I put my mind to it
Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it
I sat in the corner made up my mind do it
Def Jam on my heels should I sign to it
Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day Im hustlin on every corner boomin
Back of the Phantom couldnt fathom I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto I follow Gods orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr Roberts when Im in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it but barely niggas fade
White sheet yellow tape where your dawgs at
Count a million cash can you blog that
Me and niggas your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us
See the watch now you wanna know the name of it
Never playin so I went and got the frame flooded
Cartier Hublot I could name a dozen
Your shit pushed back cause it aint buzzin
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden
Cant talk snow where the soft at
Your man got murked but you squashed that
Hope you know what we call that
I think you know just what we call that
All you pussy boys fall back
Big face Rollie rose gold cost 40
Platinum 21 its time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once Im screamin YOLO in the VI
Time flies fast ballin with my nigga TI
Croc no glass smilin women in my presence
Tall supermodels always fall in my possession
Atlanta housewives takin pictures in my section
But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression
Show me that affection that a Dboy craves
Rich forever in my Dboy ways
So dope blue jeans new Js
Sold dope by any means all day
Been winning so many years and the future is bright
Now its very clear that we gon be rich forever
And ever and ever ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever
Huh A hundred mil aint enough
Got a hundred women gotta deal with it love
Worth forty Ms is he still dealin drugs
Cigarette speedboats but hes still with the thugs
Club LIV Louis shots on a Sunday
Grindin even be legit one day
Order some more bottles because Im on one
I know her pussy wet and she wanna cum
She wanna cum maybe come over
Stop dealin with them niggas you need one soldier
Keep you as my bitch forever
Cause you know a nigga rich forever
Been winning so many years and the future is bright
Now its very clear that we gon be rich forever
And ever and ever ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever
On the way we shed some tears Oh oh oh 
Every day we sacrifice

3059,"I am content to die for my beliefs
So cut off my head and make me a martyr
The people will always remember it
No they will forget
A man who walks with God can walk anywhere
Hence I fear nothing
The point of guerilla war is not to succeed
Its always been just to make the enemy bleed
Deprivin the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need
Bullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave
The only way a guerilla war can ever be over
Is when the occupation cant afford more soldiers
Until they have to draft the last of you into the service
And you refuse because you dont see the purpose
The only way to counter the insurgents that are wellequipped
Is to paint the people fightin for freedom as terrorists
Then find a faction lookin for foreign investment
Install them in power and murder any objections
You cant stop a revolution from breathin
So to beat em they offer people the illusion of freedom
But when youre done dreamin and wake up tortured for treason
Then you can see them hidin behind the god they believe in
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
During the night before the start of the dawn
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
Guerilla war when the army is gone
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
So Id rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless
I dont need the circus or the day of national observance
I need you to think for you and stop bein a servant
Pawns only move a square in the game that theyre used in
And realize it too late like the shooting of Huey Newton
Or Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allende
Slaughtered by the powerhungry branches of their own gente
Ghandi wasnt killed by Pakistani nationals
He was assassinated by a Hindu radical
And Che Guevara rebel to a US continent
Was sold to the CIA by Bolivian communists
Wasnt Yitzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist
And Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence
Malcolm X was seen as a threat to the FBI
But to blast em they used Muslims from the NOI
Even the 35th President of the Republic
Was murdered by factions of his own government
So now that its proven that a soldier of revolution
Or head of an empire disguised in a constitution
Can not escape the retribution or manipulation
Of the selfappointed rulers of the planets corporations
So Ima need every generation to put your hands up
Cause you can only get em off your back when you stand up
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
During the night before the start of the dawn
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
Guerilla war when the army is gone
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
I was a man blessed by God
To survive some of the worst circumstances
I had many things a beautiful woman I loved a home money
And I gave it all up to bleed and to die free
Sometimes I look back on that life
And I wonder what it wouldve been like
And in moments of weakness I think about trading it
Then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality
And I realize that Im in the heart of a war
And thats the place a martyr is born
",it too late like the shooting of Huey Newton Or Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allende Slaughtered by the powerhungry branches of their own gente Ghandi wasnt killed by Pakistani nationals He was assassinated by a Hindu radical And Che Guevara rebel to a US continent Was sold to the CIA by Bolivian communists Wasnt Yitzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist And Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence Malcolm X was seen as a threat to the FBI But to blast em they used Muslims from the NOI Even the 35th President of the Republic Was murdered by factions of his own government So now that its proven that a soldier of revolution Or head of an empire disguised in a constitution Can not escape the retribution or manipulation Of the selfappointed rulers of the planets corporations So Ima need every generation to put your hands up Cause you can only get em off your back when you stand up Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on During the night before the start of the dawn Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on Guerilla war when the army is gone Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on I was a man blessed by God To survive some of the worst circumstances I had many things a beautiful woman I loved a home money And I gave it all up to bleed and to die free Sometimes I look back on that life And I wonder what it wouldve been like And in moments of weakness I think about trading it Then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality And I realize that Im in the heart of a war And thats the place a martyr is born,I am content to die for my beliefs So cut off my head and make me a martyr The people will always remember it No they will forget A man who walks with God can walk anywhere Hence I fear nothing The point of guerilla war is not to succeed Its always been just to make the enemy bleed Deprivin the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need Bullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave The only way a guerilla war can ever be over Is when the occupation cant afford more soldiers Until they have to draft the last of you into the service And you refuse because you dont see the purpose The only way to counter the insurgents that are wellequipped Is to paint the people fightin for freedom as terrorists Then find a faction lookin for foreign investment Install them in power and murder any objections You cant stop a revolution from breathin So to beat em they offer people the illusion of freedom But when youre done dreamin and wake up tortured for treason Then you can see them hidin behind the god they believe in Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on During the night before the start of the dawn Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on Guerilla war when the army is gone Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on The purpose of life is a life with a purpose So Id rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless I dont need the circus or the day of national observance I need you to think for you and stop bein a servant Pawns only move a square in the game that theyre used in And realize

Armed to the tooth trying to take a eye for another eye
Im from We hear gunfire for a lullaby
Yo forget it who the hell am I
Yo Im the reason these MCs lies became nullified
The stuff of legend so tell me whats tougher brethren
When Im the blast from the past that started the present
Vision of the future me and the super producer
And Im ten times smart as Im used to be
And Im still seeing the voice through the speakers
Porsche two seaters Jimmy Choo speakers
Real rap remedy man a true genius
I brought Yosemite Sam two heaters
Asking these bastards if its any last words
Besides what when why and all them adverbs
You bout to be the next fugitive captured
Just keep thinking you can lie and live after
Slow your roll playboy rabbit ears
Cuz damn right its on sight like Vladimir
And by the moment in time you will be outta there
Strapped getting slapped for acting so cavalier
I come from Philly and them cowards dont travel there
Brothers let the heat rattle there they dont battle there
Itching to leave you in a pool like Mike Phelps
Learning to fight might help but thats light help
Because if bullets make flack melt
Then imagine just what itd do to you even if you a black belt
Ayo my brother still concealing with a Gat held
On a block where it used to be a lot of crack dealt
Lo and behold this is information overload
I put the crowd in a trance like Paul Oakenfold
I used to be the lowest on the totem pole
Until I reconstructed my goals left a broken mold
Setting sights on a open road
I hit up anywhere and everywhere
That realness is bought and sold
Ayo they got me on an honor roll
That means whenever speaking my name
Begin that with The Honorable
TAR one I like a monocle
I bring the riot through and laugh cuz youre comical
Look get in that ass like your father do
Hit that catatonic chronic out in Bonnaroo
Im psychological jump like Geronimo
Probably get yourself knocked down like a domino
Whoa if I dont work then I wont eat
No I dont Facebook but I might Tweet
The industry is out of control like OC
So take this L on the chin like its a goatee
Im kinda like a cellar door Im lowkey
I used to mix bottles of Champale with OE
Im Aristotle I cant fail Im OG
I came through to get free like no fee
Hey yo they got me on a pedestal trophy
Got em singing damn Riq cheating like adultery
Sycamore sitting on paper like upholstery
Noam Chomsky Im on an organized rhyme spree
Messing with this is a borderline robbery

A nigga feelin lucky we should go to Vegas
2018 mode of transportation
Got me feelin overanxious like a home invasion
My dough inflated and Im more creative
Signed a couple big deals but its no paradin
See its a couple niggas every generation
That wasnt supposed to make it out but decode the matrix
And when they get to speak its like a coded language
Reminds niggas of they strength and all the stolen greatness
We used to shoot at niggas at the Mobil station
Full circle mogul motivation
My selfeducated shrewd negotiations
Got the sharks that Im sittin at this table with afraid to bait me
No tint on my Mercedes thats for inspiration
Two kilos on my neck like the fuckin 80s
Westside Slauson Ave know my demonstration
Born and raised yall affiliated
Its really greatness ridin round like I really made it
Loaded bases Im gon Wille Mays it yah
Listen to my ambition cause Im on one
Swingin for the fences for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every seconds being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them

Motherfucker said it wasnt gonna work
That crazy shit
Yeah the stupid shit man
That shit was dope
Hey yo Eazy
Wassup
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute and bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was Gangsta Gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there coldshootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo man
Get the fuck out
Pump that beat
Mothafucka say what
Donald Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12gauge
One sucker dead LA Times front page
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo Leroy
Beer drinkin breath stinkin sniffin glue
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappyass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Who do you think you are Mr Big Stuff
Rock mothafucka like the hard three the hard way
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the sixfo round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
Ill throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
LA playa
Big Drum beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out Fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit

Yeah I kicked a little ass
But that was a blast from the past mothafucka

If I take off all the chains we can play a little hockey
You know we playin with the chop sticks shit will have you leakin sake
Let me tell you bout the story from Huaraches to Versaces

They like where you been Young Shit was bad for a minute
All them clown niggas winnin shit was sad for a minute but
Ima make these niggas get on they shit dog
If nothin else I can write a hit though
Ima need five bricks for the show dog
Plus another 20k just to throw dog

Sometime ya gotta let a nigga know dog
Sometime ya gotta fuck a nigga hoe dog
You nigga gonna learn who to fuck with
Yall hoes gon miss me with the fuck shit
Took it out the bag mixed it with the yellow box
Went to sleep woke up in a yellow watch
Do better and these niggas gon hate more
You keep it solid and these niggas gon flake more
Super nigga music need a cape hoe
Nine piece in the stove dinner date ho
And I dont fuck around with too many rap niggas
Reason bein I dont fuck around with cap niggas
See the problem is there way too many plug niggas
Which in turn means there aint enough drug dealers
This for my niggas in the trenches with the four way
Still sleepin with the toolie by the doorway
They like where you been Young Shit was bad for a minute
All them clown niggas winnin shit was sad for a minute but
Ima make these niggas get on they shit dog

3221,"Goin In 4 the Kill Remix Lyrics
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
This is for hoods everywhere
Im back
We aint come here for the chitchat
But shit got a hell of a kickback
And I dont give a fuck so your face like a Dutch
Imma go head and split that
Niggas in the top five fuck is the list at
Everybody die where they poppin they Cris at
Gun in your mouth brain on your wall you try to get louder than I
Go smoke Im responsible for clouds in the sky
And you couldnt find a nigga thats wilder than I
The roof the same color as shit nigga
Run up and hit niggas God bless whoever you with nigga
Somebody gonna break down and cry when they look at your face
How the four bullets break down your eye
Im from a place where you kicked out or die
Shit real when they catch you at the wheel
And blow your face out the ride
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill
If you forgot my name or my style
Im the ghost with the hornet flow with a corner style
In a piece of shit car
With two 45s bout to rob everything I been gone a while
They aint let you know Im a grimeball
Whenever the time calls I find yall Im taking your spine off
Lets be serious dead serious
If you with cops how you lettin your nine off
Yo you got a hole in you and you bleeding
So its not like Im just callin you pussy for no reason
Me Im a bastard
I hit the blunts til I gotta cough then I pass em
Exhaust on the Aston
That next choice you make might be your last one
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now whos the king of New York now
Boys got safes in the house I got a vault now
Chorus La Roux Jadakiss 
Im goin in for the kill
Im doin it for a thrill
Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Just mad you will never be as nice as I am 
Im goin in for the kill

Just mad you will never be as nice as I am 
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill

DBlock daddy new black Caddy
Comin through knocking Michael McDonald and Pattie
Ps and haze is still going for eight and a natty
Rather have God arrest me then Satan and bag me
Get serious Ill gladly involve ya moms
AlQaeda Jada Im only involved with bombs
Ugh put my life on it
Soon as you sit in hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
Ive been giving it to niggas for years
Im responsible for niggas careers

Fast money fuckin hoes flippin work call me flip
Rap niggas all diesel homie probably a script
See the black van packed up skimasks black gloves
Four niggas mashed up get a nigga wrapped up
I did it like a boss fuck a handout
Room full of centers Im a standout
Now I gave em no choice got the cokeboy shit planned out
Hundredfifty Spider all tanned out Montana Montana

The drama messy I send some niggas to clean for me
They leave the scene spotless I like my Vs topless
The hoes talk about me see Im the trendin topic
See the riots that gang and yall know that
That break it up and give it to the strip you know Im on that
Im stickin to the format
Never catch him slippin like Im stickin to the floormat
So these niggas could fall back
I toss some money in the sky and watch it trickle down
Came a long way from the Ps take a look at me now

Oh Im hoping youll understand
And not let go of my hand
Im goin in for the kill

Custommade Lenscrafters still couldnt see me

983,"Welcome to America
Where you can dream as long as you can breathe
You can be the muhfuckin President of United States
And get murdered right on these streets
Welcome to America
The sins of the father my pop gave me to suffer
The friends I would follow was crack babies and hustlers
Its steel sharpen steel in the block made me a cutler
My pen is from the future like Octavia Butler Wlcome to America oh 
My grandmother suturd a flag from bloody cotton
The fruits of her labor alas already rotten Welcome to America yeah ayy 
My man said Yo its crazy how fast that weve forgotten
That we used to pull boxes and plows like we were oxen
And cows without an option and now its this glorious
Victorious story only pitched
For me to shut it down they sold some of us down the rivers
Its such a poor level of thought I get the shivers
Its insidious and its always been hideous
I had to tread water and run be amphibious
They do you so dirty for one yo whats cleanliness
They make you wanna let off a gun into the emptiness like
Preach now lover preach now lover
That we runnin runnin runnin runnin runnin
Welcome to America
Yo Im illfated and hated Im hella melanated
Blackness is my religion to that Im dedicated Welcome to America 
I follow the laws of nature by which Im regulated
The universe my university Im educated
This one is for my very revolutionaries
After keeping it a hundred even though the truth is heavy
Who stand firmly and see their life is a journey
That either God or the gurney my public defender burned me
So did the district attorney in a turbulent trial
They told me that time is master well Im serving it now
Tell my family Ill be making my return in a while
And every symbol of oppression Ill be burning it down
Welcome to America Yeah 
Where you can dream as long as you can breathe Long as you breathe 
You can be the muhfuckin President of United States Thats right 
And get murdered right on these streets Doo doo 
Welcome to America
Land of the brave Yeah and home of the free Thats bullshit man 
You can be a saint or a sinner or a billionaire Yeah 
Or just stand on your feet
Welcome to America Keep on runnin runnin 
America oh Lord Keep on runnin runnin 
Welcome to America Keep on runnin runnin 
America oh yeah
Cause when its over the world aint over The world aint over 
What they say is what well do Its what we gon do now 
We outpowered still have power Still got power 
And thats what we cannot lose
Runnin in the shadows got my eye on the sparrow
Tomorrow may not come at least my soul felt this love Uh 
If I let you go at least my soul felt this love
Hey now hang now hey now hang now
Now a Black soul never passes alone
If its blood spilled on the ancestors ashes and bone
From a pure heart the Lord fashioned after His own
Went packaged and flown to the essence of his African throne
For every lost body crossed tarred feathered and tossed
Its no way I could measure the course or ever exhaust
But whether its yours or mine this American cloth
Has never been soft while history was running its course
I ran hard from Jamestown with slaves found Jesus
And foul demons that never be charged with malfeasance
I sat through they revival though I never found credence
I found that we had never known shit about freedom
Ive been charged with treason Ive been scarred and freezin
Ive been called a nigga and then called a heathen
When hounds found me they couldnt even tell if I was breathin
In America where on black men its open season

Yo the monster don is in the building we in here
Kanye West is in the building
Ghostface
Your boy getting fat now
I got the fat stomach and laid up eating good now
Other girl all stressed out my girl got the fat ass
Shorty mad pulling her hair out
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that no
Im high powered put Eva Mendes to sleep
Yo pardon that bitch been on my mind all week
But back to you MAC gloss chick youre way fit
How you have everything in this world and waste it
Prince told me itll be okay Im so sick like NeYo say
Im laid back like Neo so I holla back at this Creole ho
She from the NO but she never told me NO so
We at the spot to chill where the food get grilled
She ordered the Kobe beef like Shaquille ONeal
Second I walked in the whole room got still
I dont know how to put this but Im kind of a big deal
And she conceited she got a reason
She got her hair did she got her weave in
And Imma sweat that out by the evening
You I dont sweat that now I got a new
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that no
Oh girl I cant believe you zoned out
Played me for this dude nice shoes and a bottle of coast out Mont

First one to put you up six suites in that Resident Hilton
Mink coach colorful stones and big stacks
Yeah I was fucking but you dont get me back like that
Causing me grief you know me and homey had beef
Now you got me losing my mind out up in these streets
You flamingo showing your true colors
Heard yall was ducking down low when you see my brothers
But its all good I move from ex to next
Got the baddest little chick to sign off of them checks
Fat bubble her bodys like one of the best
But I dont need to say nothing ask Kanye West
She eye candy smoother than Godiva chocolate
And you mad cause you played yourself its your fault trick
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that no
Shot through the heart the girl caught me
Shot through the block with him shot gun
He lucky I aint stop copped the shotgun
Killah type cat you better be glad Im not one
Had a couple stars up in my sky
She was my moon and my sunshine
Dude aint even fly he just some guy
You blamed yourself Im done peace one
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack

Were here because you were there
Weve arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America We were promised a better life in our home countries where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury Some corporations are more efficient than government but their motivation is not the health or the wellbeing of the people its only about profit Everything elsetheir image their human resources their public relationsonly exist to protect the reality behind it Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture by those who never had our interests at heart They didnt care about our survival or wellbeingthey just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land by exploiting our people our industry and our resources They took everything we built and made it theirs first by creating racism to justify slavery building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty everything we had was still owned by them Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God
Open your eyes before you die

Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget but its hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt I get high as I can

Harley Davidson every
Time I grab the mic I got you savorin the moment
Tell opponents that I play to win
Dont try to test me son leave you headless with the tounge
Restless like the Young knowin that the best has yet to come
Thats how the West was won
My content house you like a convent competition must be nunnone
I just begun get in line and take a number
Stay off the dick racin sometimes the boy wonder
Most of you MCs dont know Jack about Lumber
My rap chomp contenders like axe I yell timber
Im fat like the wife and like Jack Sprat you slender
Theres no comparison you got beef its probably tender
You still wanna battle me What for
I rock heads like Mt Rushmore fourfor dead presidents
Its evident I got it made
If you a slave to the rhythm you givin I freestyle like Honest Abe
For every promise made I fulfill with the skill
No matter what the doctor prescribe I stay ill
I can barely hear the track but Imma do it anyway
You put me on the stage with wack MCs oh shit
Thats like puttin piranhas in the same tank with goldfish
Hypnosis keep the alphabet under my spell
Sometimes I wonder myself
Lyrically can anybody test me
Exorcist please help me find what possesses me
I speak demonic ebonics into electronic devices
Leavin my opposition lifeless
My crew terrorize your whole town
Stay inside lock your doors dont be stupid like Nicole Brown
Word is bond yall
I got more Juice than Orenthal
So just acquittedquit it
Im takin out you suckers and you dont know how I did it
When Im on trial
Guilty as sin my murderous flow remains a freestyle
The only way Im goin to the pen is when
I slaughter with alphabetical disorder
BAD MC hit you with spellbound
Bust that wicked ass greyhound hell bound
One way ticket aint no comin back here
I drop bombs 365 black year
Jap style on ya Pearl Harbor rap style
Antisocialist I play the background
Spotlight operator aim at Yac town
If you dont know the time then its time to act now

Always testing folks and always have a reason
Blame the pain from before the sight is never leaving

Cant set you free you still have hesitation
Been trained through pain theres love
Most of us have sailed above
Pain games and lighting old flames
Girls being blue is such a shame
Taking secrets with you to the grave
Little girl its you I cant save
Playing games and lighting old flames
Girls being blue is such a shame
Yeah yeah the birds

I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery its everything
She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill uh like OK Go
Had a body A body that you cant pay fo
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasnt fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes tryin hard to be chose
They say its hard for a pimp but extra hard for these hoes 
Readin Us and People mag tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild

Love is not a mystery its everything
He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types da DDDame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebodyd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes thats athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
Its a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery its everything
They was one of them couples people said they were the it
Unbreakable like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and youre lyin and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery its everything
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down

I know this girl with her own crib in isolation
Shes from Puerto Rico halfblack on vacation
Fine freak with thongs on whup me every week
Panties in service the big twos make her nervous
Hey Boo heres lollipops Imma give em too you
Bang you nice backdoors Imma scrape the floors
Look at your personal silk on the camcorder
Then hit bedsprings my thumbs on the tape recorder
With big cups of Cristal Imma spank her well
If I lick you there my girlfriend Imma tell
Rock your boots and leave my style written on your cooch
With rubber demands condoms in your soft hands
I got plans for booty work to catch a lapdance
That skirt is workin and by myself I be jerkin
on to the chorus
I want that purple Cadillac with the lime green ragtop yeah
Lovely lady girl you drive me crazy 3X 
She got me open like two big scoops of Raisin Bran
Watchin adult films Im part time her freak man
Thinkin how shes cute I got my mask on my eye
Lickin splits that switch and change her whole voice pitch
Ayyy papi why you go so low
I got scuba divin skills the pros stay below
Authorizin a sign she reflects with pantylines
She got her hair done apartment two the girl is mines
Trippin down the pants shes wearin spandex
And flower dresses the booty to the max apex
Im on my way with Guinness Stout everyday
Jodeci tapes HTown not bring 4Play
Couches are plush no quickies ladies dont rush
You know my flavor lubricated bareback
Stroke to get live you melt down when I tap the sack
Like Kojak detective I got your contraceptive
I know your perspective if you get picked Im selective
Rubbin you down in baths Calgon bound
You lookin sexy smilin in that soft nightgown
Baby love it when I blow bubbles kiss her stomach
Shes a dimepiece I popped up on the East
The lady is ready tell Duke Imma rock her steady
Lovely lady girl you drive me crazy 3X 
Tight BM she wanna give me her W
Take me shoppin do what I want to do it when I want to do
I play the game right work out that back tonight
Disco lights beam dancin at Southside
She got her lingerie on sippin on 
Emotional status Im puttin tongues to the baddest
Bitin the peaches cherries open on the beaches
I got her turned out screamin in the bleachers
Infedelis her friends are mad gettin jealous
Blockin my great view some knuckleheads down too
Who is it Wizard I got the address Imma visit
Go down solo she workin night at the GoGo
New York City Ampex she pays for my reels
Shes admire me her pockets with tons of bills
She lookin good comin from work
I hope she bought me a pair of them expensive Morieallis reels

Rest in peace to my homies that done made it home
RIP to Danny and Darnelle
I reminice on when my broter Kevin got killed
I cant sleep I know its sad
One day they gon put P up in a body bag
I watch movies like Ghost
Wonderin if my brother really know who slit his motherfuckin throat
And when they gone yall thought it was a poem
And the ghettos tryin to kill me Im still tryin to make it home
And mama cry and daddy say son realize
Just remember one day we all gotta die
I cant trip Im sinkin with this ship
In the projects you know its one big battlefield
Where everybody dont give a fuck about another life
And lil kids dont give a fuck about another life
They quick to put chu to that other game
And if you lose in that battlefield then thats yo ass man
And yo life is sinkin on with them other niggas
Cause they dead and gone now what the fuck is goin on
To underestimate you see ya own fate
You straight gettin poped in the ShowMe State
Two slugs to the face man brace yourself
While other cats view the body at the wake
And I hate to think about what we gonna miss out on
Knowin yo ass is gone
Cause I know we gonna miss em
And I hate the fact that a brother done passed on
The things we do we gotta deal with
Can ya feel it on the reala
Watchin the blood spill from the veins of a real one
RIP cause ya couldve been a G
And still alive to kick it with me
Never let it fade cause ya locked in a grave
RIP to my homies
Im constantly surrounded by death
And my citys so scandalous
So I step with a half cockin that stainless steel
Cause I feel that I have to be strapped
Cause I learned from all of my dead folks mishaps
A lot of my dogs took a fall
Cause of a flaw on the streets when concernin mail
Between two brothers been homies forever
When lookin past the yellow tape fool I cant tell
This is the world I live in
My world is consumed by chaos
Makin me not want to get too close to folks
In fear of the pain Ill feel
When anothers called off hauled off
In a Caddy brown tryin to hang on let em go
I shed a few tear I spilled some beer
And appear to be at peace
But inside Im so cold
Cause I think of how my homie caught slugs to the mug
And I cant let that be me
Keep ya memory close to my heart
So may ya soul rest in peace
Now why life be so hard
I beend down with these wars
Since Ses my ace caught a slug to the chest
From a tech and I hope he finally at rest
See thats why I didnt cry when my homie died Lord hear me
Too many murderers and drug dealers and killers standin in me
Lord forgive me
Im bout ready to check it out but Imma stick it out like a G
Cause its a sin for me to kill myself
And I wont let a nigga kill me
Ima try to hold on to these memories
But it seems all my homies done changed since elementary
Now life is the same as death and thats kind of bad to me
For every nonblack males born one dies thats kind of like sad to see
I lost my brother behind some jealousy
Not stayin on his toes livin carelessly
From the cradle to grave I always see a better day
RIP to my Gs and I hope they in a better place
Yeah this for all my motherfuckin true soldiers
Thats gone with the wind ya know what Im sayin
All my niggas that restin in peace
Hope yall in a better place homie
Cause its hell on Earth nigga know what Im sayin
We see yall in the crossfire
For all my true soldiers rest in peace fool
And uh No Limit till I die
See yall niggas on the other side
RIP to my homies that are dead and gone
And to all my niggas Down South hustlin
Just remember stack ya mail live life to the fullest
Cause ya cant take none of this shit with ya
And always keep ya eye on the enemy
Might be ya best friend but watch yourself homie
Oh yeah the most important thing never trust a bitch
Cause a bitch only out for the money
Know what Im sayin
Remember that though
Yeah playa RIP

526,"Gold medals them my role models
Rollin old models lowered old schools flowin cold
And goin gold follows
Flower bearin call it petals to the floor
Power sharin call it devils to the door
Power power til aint no devils anymore
Flowerflowers they be droppin at the feet of my sun
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet to the beat of my drum
It was little Susie Uzi she sold crack and was a killer
Allbitch dope tip wasnt trappin with no niggas
Had a long money minor do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic crackin off the Richter yeah
Walked up to my ride asked me Could she get inside
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me out here in the streets she aint have no competition
And with me up on them beats
Then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips she said
Now heres my proposition
You just write a bunch of raps for me and Ima go and spit em
Then we take em to the radio the DJ better spin em
Then we take em to the record store
And sell a couple million woo

From a trapper to a rapper trapper to a rapper
We gotta gon do it
Trapper to a rapper now nigga make it happen
Ugh told me call up Soundtrakk have him send a couple beats
Not that Superstar shit she wanted somethin for the streets
Said it might take like a month she said It better take a week
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said I saw that thing the first time you dont gotta do it twice
But I need a lil more info on exactly what I write
Some details bout a female bout your life and what you like
She said My life is like a bitch and Im just like my life
Then powpowpowpowpow Yeah them niggas started bustin
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
She said Nigga hit the gas went from zero to a hundred
Now we runnin from some killers I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin out the window with that thumper she was dumpin
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin
We was swervin jumped the curb and ditched the whip and started runnin
Tried to jump over a wall but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and thats how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin hard and she was sittin there smokin kush
Then we both started to glow we looked around like What is this
And then we looked up and a light
Came down and pulled us to a ship like What the fuck
I already got the money already got the bitches
I see these other niggas Ima do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper now nigga make it happen Shit 
Well now this the shit Im talkin bout the shit that Ive been on
Yeah lightyears outer space but still a bitch feel right at home
Now where the bitches Get them intergalactic asses to clappin
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah I could never go back to trappin
And who needs Atlanta when youre on Saturn gettin a lap dance
With a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment I could burn this shit up
Why you standin there just lookin nigga Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy let me know how it work
Im just sayin Im gon be there and I aint in no rush
Nah nigga Nah nigga I aint in no rush
Ayy I thought you couldnt rap when you learn how to do that
Then what you need me for if you already know how to flow
Ayy fuck that we gotta go weldnt be in this hoe
If you told me from the jump we wouldnt be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us stole a key so I can try it
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin saucer pilot
But first things gon be first when we get back to that earth
Ima go back to them raps and you can go back to that work nigga
I already got the money already got the bitches
I see these other niggas Ima do it how they did it
Nigga were goin home home
From a trapper to a rapper trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper now nigga make it happen
You can kill me I dont careno

Swag mania pop that goes most carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close gross when we give them a dose
Got them ODing leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze take notes rock Rolls diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter who fucking with us
We coming to give them the shivers watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas get up when we show up
Uhh shit
Please dont throw up hold your liquor grow up
If you robbing niggas we gon show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars its the Rap Czar tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin my chagrin
You never win model thin walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on talk shit while we ball so whats cracking with yall
Native New Yorker the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily God Im stupid so undisputed
Act fool back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street blocking them off locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up maintaining composure stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles twenty waitresses bring them over

Settle up stiletto up saddle up and lets go
Good times only difference niggas making it though
Chatter is up peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain folding the ladder up
You dead and done rip up your paper cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page whether chopper or gauge
Youre just a single cause you wouldnt engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup you keep the goblets with us
See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff
Beat him in the head boopbededeboff zippityboof
Beat him in the head again Stop killing me wolf
Whop beat a nigga till he drop piggitypoof
Ock see him he puss he dont want no problem with niggas
Fuck it lets get to drinking poison our livers
Dammit we sinners when me and Abstract together see we deliver
She got me touching it fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners pillar of this rap shit homie they know
Kill everything until its time for me to go
Thats when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding you should take it from me
Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music iTune it YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
Its gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and inbetweeners blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas drink Aliz liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
Shes begging to eat us and her mans attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus were prone to handle
Were gentlemen
Not to mention were veterans second he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly you pelican idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless its never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons see how I come and bring out the betterness
Time is with it I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates sized private plane that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating see we all in this bitch like we aint never left
I want to thank You Heavenly Father

Im legendary legenlegendary Im lelelegendary
The theme song to my supplier plays in the key of a ki Im like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles This the Christ chapter
Im sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Dont take me light or play me light we two of the same
God melted the Rubiks cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
Im eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice now Im running through until Im through with the game
You can find me under a black cloud Im a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style itd be Sammy Cassells
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause its the hammer the cannon you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
Im a heavyweight Im catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 911 meditate til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my fetti straight
The MAC11ll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes
Youll see surprise and realize theres no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the I in try
Ryan vibes like cyanide I am proud
To say that Ive evolved theres only one I in defying odds
Smalltime arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who yall respect is probably crossdressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself vibing to my Lost Sessions
Im legendary
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they dont really know whats in my heart
This time around its startin to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
Im legendary legenlegendary lelelegendary 
My enemies starting to fall down
Im legendary leglegendary 
Fall down lelelegendary legendary legendary 
Im legendary
I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap niggas can Google this gat
Cause we the reason why you eating we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you aint do jack
Just who we kidding here This heres a different year
So you shouldnt assume that Im tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back in fact
As far as you new kids what have you did
I know that Ive burnt some bridges in the past but Im happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing Im forever willing and ready
I will make my childrens peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb
You get the Ghini Im sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh while Im listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow the blunted joint heres the reefer
One minute you tough one minute you shook
I know I learned a while ago to hide power from you I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites I kill you every time
Throw a nigga body around the room have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the bestdressed lie
And why you niggas is hating
I wonder is God really an atheist He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Yall need to repent cause yall been imitating
A statue of me to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Lets tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle Im a big wig
My straws in the hole of a volcano Im having a big swig
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they dont really know whats in my heart

1386,"Like anybody I would like to live a long life longevity has its place
But Im not concerned about that now
I just want to do Gods will
And Hes allowed me to go up to the mountain
And Ive looked over
And Ive seen the Promised Land
I may not get there with you
But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land
So Im happy tonight
Im not worried about anything Im not fearing any man
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at it always follows you where you are
And its hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But its harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically runnin from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South I respect they vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of Americas vision
They want us dancin coonin and hollerin
Only respect us for playin sports and modelin
More than racism its stay in your placeism
More people are trapped in practical blackfaceism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
Its between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Crip niggas Blood niggas eses Asians
Why the fuck we warrin with each others population
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation why the separation
Why we got Jamaicans hatin on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other straight hatin
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness inwhat Im sayin
You gotta recognize another G aint the enemy
When the police ride and kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets we should really end war
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Our hearts were torn apart just like yall was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Every time we called your office you ignored us
Now you holdin hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us ask if were jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of selfdefense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom justice security
But theyre only pure when theyre applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Urgently puttin fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qurans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me my wife and babies we aint never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesnt come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you Civil war

1806,"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never never never trust
Hoohoohoohoohoo
Them nuh know what them do
Dig out your eye while Im sticking like glue
Fling skin grin while them plotting for you true
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Me a tell you dem nuh know 
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Fi be real them nuh have a clue 
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose its those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition they do
Oh
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
Why every Indian wanna be the chief
Feed a man till he full and he still want beef
Give me grief try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase I must decrease
If I treat you kindly does it mean that Im weak
You hear me speak and think I wont take it to the streets
I know enough cats that dont turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you cant list them
How you gon idolize the missing To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming gunning I stand position
Ls known the mission since conception
Lets free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle
March through these streets like Soweto uhh
Like Cain and Abel Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas backstabbers do this
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves to themselves
A friend once said and I found to be true
That everyday people they lie to God too
So what makes you think that they wont lie to you
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Forgive them forgive them 
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Forgive them forgive them 
Gwan like dem love you while dem rip you to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart and leff you fi dead
Dem a yuh friend who you depend pon from way back when
to grace 
But if you gi dem yuh back then you must meet yuh end
Dem nuh know what dem do do
Whos gonna be the one 
Dem nuh know what dem do do
Gotta be the one to say 
Dem nuh know dem nuh know dem nuh know dem nuh know
Dem nuh know what dem do do

Hey now uh LA yeah Chi Town Philadelphia PA
Listen pick any city the South side the outside
It isnt pretty the tots cryin and shots fired
Protection there be the lopsided cop kind
You see the scene of a crime like every stop sign
My section of twentyone pound is downtown
They walkin round wit the guns out its wild how
The youngings dumb proud followin the crowd now
Leading the blind with they minds up in the Soundcloud
Aint a lotta sunshine when you on a frontline
Listenin to that ghetto drumline duckin onetime
Thinkin how the Devil doesnt tire even sometimes
Wonderin how the fuck could ones rhyme be this unkind
Everybody cold to me seeming through this bullshit
The only thing that sold to me bein told we should hold on
Gettin old to me Im about to buckle
Cause holdin tight got my hands fully whiteknuckled
And to be honest tomorrow is not promised
Whether you on the streets of Chicago or Botswana
You gotta be rock solid not to be outsmarted
The rise from rockbottom to one of the top scholars
I never ask whats the secret of success
With a target on your back and a scarlet on your chest
Listen just get it not a minute to rest
This is not a test settle for the best nothin less dig it
Pick any city the South side the drought side
Where EMS has arrived well its about time
People who just get they tops fried get outlined
Minutes and seconds go clockwise but not mine
Where Im from its a war scene
Where more fiends scream for Morphines Zoloft and Thorazine
We dont subscribe to the grand scheme
The plans seems to be keepin us all sick sellin them vaccines
Aint a lot of fun time when your only son dyin
And the worlds comin untied from the inside
Thats between affection and depression its a thin line
Stress and pressure here is multiplied ten times
Everything is blurred to me lessons deferred for me
Fam said its been a long term since they heard from me
My lil homie never made it out of surgery
Sometimes I feel like South Philly tryna murder me
First everybodys upset cause you died
They like Wait a minute man
I aint the ones whos dead hes the one thats brown bread
Hah so in comes the second lie ya dig

Space Age forever Space Age baby yeah
The name of the game is get no sleep
Mash on niggas and always roll deep
Non stop hustle means all profits double
Young nigga tryin to see rocks like Barney Rubble
Vampire circulate when the moon rise
Do dirt when most people got closed eyes
Rollin livin off garbage and scraps
Niggas wouldnt even fuck with me if I didnt rap
Thinkin bout that man thats just another trap
Another nigga dead from another niggas strap
Space Age in every thought and everything I write
Livin for today a nigga might die tonight
Just because a nigga think Im a celebrity
They want to rob and jack and try to bury me
Forced entry embedded in my memory
Fightin sleep like Freddie Kruger tryin to get me
In the midst I wanna see it not hear about it
If a nigga wanna see it gotta be up out it
Cant do without it sayin til my life end
Everynight they like catch me up again
Chorus
You say like daylight its gonna catch me up again
Gonna catch me up gonna catch me up again
Some people like gettin up when Im just gettin in
Gonna catch me up gonna catch me up again
I look up I cant see the forest for the trees
Destined to make it through regardless of the seeds
Of evil that been planted sproutin concrete walls
So everybody have sex til its after all
You playin wrong now you havin to climb so you can make it
Got the whole road blocked and too thick for you to brake it
Dont fake it you know its hard for you to shake it
The camels tellin you to come on you had to cake it
Mr Mistake it Mr Do Nothing uncle give me something
You mouth tellin me love but I aint feelin none
Stealin some same positions Ive been facin for years
Now Im about to put some steak in this meal
Inflatin my bills excusin you hos who want fame
Using you hos for one thang fuck how you changed bitch
Its funny why you stayed around
And patience how you laid me down
Now you exspectin the crown
Im full time respectin the game
Checkin out the girls in change
A turd in the hand is far worst than a turd in a commode
Let that shit float on cause that shit get old
Chorus
It seems that daylight is gonna catch me up again
Gonna catch me gonna catch me up again
Some people like gettin up when Im just gettin in
Gonna catch me gonna catch me up again

You got nine cars tons of champagne by the cases

You petrified hallucinatin thinkin hardcore
You got the style now you have to roll with 50 people
Lookin hard and mean you aint pullin triggers

You get pistolwhipped booty tapped face scarred
Down and out with camouflage gear and no war
You aint in the army kid
Little girls think theyre hardcore 3X 
Now your shows packed up youre gassed up
Im there youre scared
You just turned trois looked away feelin weird
You on the walkie talkie standin close near the door
Thinkin bout your records how you pop doodoo more
Posses wait in Texas Detroit for the bumrush
You bringin rubber your crew is nervous smokin dust
You perpetrate your front show your teeth smokin blunts
Rappers cancel shows ran away with stunts

Three kids from DC pulled out what you laughin at
You ran out funny style girl style panty style
Freestyle the same style last week
You was bitin off that kid Bo Peep
With no panties on your rectum got torn
Rearranged I caught you after the show
Naked out butt out cracked out with two rolls of film
Tryin to sell pictures of your lover
With you molestin your little brother
I smacked you and stole your pistols
Little girls think theyre hardcore 4X 
Tommy didnt I raise you to go to Catholic school

3528,"You ever have a cold in the summer
That shit be the worse
It gets better though
Howâtheyâturn a topâdog to an underdog
Its a coldâworld even in the summer dawg
Like a hunnid missed calls in my number log
I talk to God fore I talk to people from them blogs
Gotta see through it when its thick as London fog
Im from the city baby I done grew up under Small
Not to bring up old shit Im not a plunger dawg
No dalmatian but I come through with a hunnid dawg
And they dont bark they bite
Let it spark they might
Gotta walk straight right
Turn the dark to daylight
Let em talk they right
In your heart stay light
Play your part stay tight
Bosses park where they like
Dont you let them trick you out your spot and put that guy on
Rather cut em off and let a bygone be a bygone
When you ballin you that nigga that they got they eye on
So I think I know just how it feel to be a Zion
Bussin out sneakers swingin on rims
Being number 1 bringing on Ms
Hope the Knicks get him Ima bring him Timbs
Tell em lace his boots Ima give a king some gems
Like look you the great hope and a scapegoat
You gon have to make quotes and take notes
And some cant take smoke so they may choke
But those who learn to make boats stay afloat
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer

Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer

No feelings for the whole summer
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
The media promoting fake they just stampin and shit
You dont wanna see us beef then stop ampin and shit
They was giving Meek an L said he wouldnt prevail
Next thing you know that boy was in a championship
So everyday Im goin in Im on some vampire shit
And every night Im in my bag like Im campin and shit
The trenches that we grew up in need to know you can win
So you see me in my hood on my champion shit
See a minor setback breed a major get back
If I lose it aint over I be yelling bet back
I come from where they take it you might never get back
Gotta shoutout New Jersey yall wont get the Nets back
Play for keeps round here Pradas deep round here
Shooters creep round here hard to sleep round here
Life cheap round here Grim Reap round here
Spilled milk get wiped up we dont weep round here
We just goin harder we raisin sons and growin daughters
Came a long way and workin on going farther
Grew up not knowing fathers seeing no one bother
But know my story gets better cause I know the author
Keep readin its a comeback story
I told her that if you leave dont ever come back shawty
I be sayin word to Mother she the one that taught me
Karma is a bitch who hoes around and come back for me
Cold

Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
I just feel like life is hot and cold
Ups and downs back and forth
Wins and losses
Its gon be some sunshine and its gon some rain
And when it rain it pours
But ask yourself can you weather the storm until the sun shines again

2935,"When Im in motion its just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
Quick as a Lamborghini smooth as a Lexus
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes Im the most prime of all time
Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin and the lyrics just start
To flowing ahem ahem coughing couldnt stop me from going
On with the rapture so that I capture
Your mind with state of the art music made to adapt to
To knowledge the God on the groove
Because when my tongue moves I just love that Im smooth
Do it with these and in times I leave reas reason 
To give em a little of the flavor that please
As I school in the who in pursuin and doin and reignin again and the
Gutter and stutter and killin and chillin collectin the rent and
Jammin and slammin and damn its
Too much for one mind to comprehend
A pure blend the way that I make words mend
And the way that I be doin rappers in
Michael Bivins couldnt make these Boyz II Men
I display somethin verbally capable to murder the
Average MC the tough ones Ill burn third degree
And if youre thinkin that Im takin a beatin
Youre sure to see the Pink Panther speakin
Im a native New Yorker I pitch a lot of porker
When I get my ride I be the grill squawker
Tips a smooth talker I love Alice Walker
So get off the dillz and step back you little hawker
Better yet you hooker you wanna show I book ya
The highest way I took ya is youse a good looker
Queens is residential I make the presidentials
Over instrumentals I utilize the mentals
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square
If you went in by yourself it was a terror
See I could do that cause my crew is kinda phat
Outside we had the toolies out West you call em gats
Its that oh thanks chat well let me drop some more shit
Bring your bats and balls and please dont forfeit
Cause you wont get away your status will be stank
You can ride with me G Im goin to the bank
To meet up with Kane up on Dollar Lane
You get the idea cause page times is near
So rappers see they bug cause they really cant handle
Position from the rappin cause some of them be slackin
Not in this sport of thought we block out the devil
The three different flavors you know we on the level
Check it out uhh As I come down and get dumb
Yes roughneck swingin along with the drum
Swimmin in the track retaliatin thorough is how
I react Busta Rhymes will attack
As you feel the pain bass kick impacts to the brain
Gotta make a mega migraine
Whattup To the Big Daddy and Tip
My trip flip the rhyme then I dip
Hey hiphop cool bust the interlude
Wack do ya on the stage gettin booed
This structure it takes bust the angle of three different flavors
On a young raider choc well thats my vocal fader
Keep my volume on extra boom
All the vains in my neck symbolizes that I want room
Word up huh Here I am damn
Dragon slayer stackin layer after layer
This jam will be ran while the record flim flam
Wiggle your front pram to the runnin man
Sam Busta Rhymes comin on time
LONS did rip a new design
Flavor one taste the unborn baby
Flip before you move or catch a bad one baby
Chiggy change chump the over sized puff
Busta pump you and the love and then I rump
Emotional stare point for the wild

Block lit all I did was come out for some fresh air
Big chain nice watch fresh gear heck yeah
Killers respect killers soft niggas respect fear
Crazy cause I love it but I hate it that I rep there
Sad part about it is that I made it when I left there
Sorry to whoever anticipated my death here
You die they hope dont sleep stay woke
The more money you get the more its your fault they broke
Catch a bullet in your culo
In the hood thats how they do though
Cause aint nothin new yo what
This aint nothin new this aint nothin new
To nigga like me man this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this aint what I do
This aint nothin new it aint nothin new
Nah but maybe to a nigga like you
Cause round here man see see this an everyday thing
No it aint nothin new
Never turn down when its on Im front line
Always respected whats real I want mine
Anytime they shot up the hood was go time
Once you start cuttin in life you so live
If you have some smut on your name you cant grind
Over reputation and pride we gon die
When the police asked for the truth I told lies
And when I finally got in this booth my soul cried
Once you off the stoop its through you no child
Aint make no excuse for your youth or no size
See me I graduated these streets in 05
Still live and die by these rules you know why

Go get your crew put my prints on the semi Im bustin
Grateful I know the difference between plenty and nothin
Im on the block on the crate sippin Henny and puffin
And even though its all love keep your enemies lustin
Lick a shot off then let two go

2005,"Prayer 1998 Lyrics
I come to you hungry and tired you give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak you give me strength and thats deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only askin that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I aint perfect but youd like me to try
Unlike the Devil who just wants me to lie til I die
Lord why is it that I go through so much pain
All I saw was black all I felt was rain
I come to you because its you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that when you asked for this story
I put it together to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way but I hid
And I remember once you held me close but I slid
There was somethin that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be
And I think Ive seen it cause I dont feel the same
Matter of fact I know Ive seen it I can feel the change
And its strange almost got me beatin down your door
But Ive never known love like this before
Its a wonderful feelin to get away from the pain
And up under the ceilin I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when Im here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tear its on
And I almost lost faith when you took my man
Monty Paso and Jays brother Dan
And I fear that what Im sayin wont be heard until Im gone
But its all good cause I really didnt expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die but please Lord treat him right
",I hid And I remember once you held me close but I slid There was somethin that I just had to see That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be And I think Ive seen it cause I dont feel the same Matter of fact I know Ive seen it I can feel the change And its strange almost got me beatin down your door But Ive never known love like this before Its a wonderful feelin to get away from the pain And up under the ceilin I get away from the rain And the strain that I feel when Im here is gone I know real so I wipe away the tear its on And I almost lost faith when you took my man Monty Paso and Jays brother Dan And I fear that what Im sayin wont be heard until Im gone But its all good cause I really didnt expect to live long So if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light Give me pain till I die but please Lord treat him right,Prayer 1998 Lyrics I come to you hungry and tired you give me food and let me sleep I come to you weak you give me strength and thats deep You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures Only askin that I keep the focus in between the chapters You give me the word and only ask that I interpret And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent You know I aint perfect but youd like me to try Unlike the Devil who just wants me to lie til I die Lord why is it that I go through so much pain All I saw was black all I felt was rain I come to you because its you who knows You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory So it was only right that when you asked for this story I put it together to do our dogs some good Our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood Plenty of times you sent help my way but
3168,"Uh king climb from adolescence
Meantime back to finessing guess youre guessing
And PMSin in the wrong direction
The BM stretchin for so long perfecting
Tweaking my engine dreaming my crown on peaking the legend
Heavens cadences Im famous for
God sends halos Im hanging more rookies will die for nothing
Only remember kin names in war
Social beefing is weak so dont anticipate a post or a tweet
I dont even like to speak
Aint no competition breathing hard luck
I handicap your squad up
Im panty stacking broads up your favorite rapper bar struck
Writers collision cooked in a psychos kitchen
Juxs now the titles missing hooked the recitals listen
If I told you I was tired would you judge me
Would you criticize my counter disappearances youre lucky
I dont flip and target anyone they consider above me
Start picking them off one by one that would be lovely and ugly
They say you gon reap what you sow
There aint no love here in this place that I call home
No one to lean on I been out here on my own
Dont need no haters round me fuckin up my zone
Youre well protected aint no better way to roam
Hand on my heater cause you never really know
Separate yourself they aint gon let you grow
I wanna win dont think the hood gon let me go oh
Yeah peace be placed to purity more chances for the wicked
Made my darker days be full moons where all the goons can kick it uh
My lifes explicit killer style few shrooms and mix it
Perfect elixir addict with two tools terrific
I own a ticket pen my verse twitching
You timeline scrolling and Im soul searching me and my coal coaching
Blue dont fuck with them niggas great em in third person
Freedom and no purping 3D and gold version
Knee deep in flows curtain shade out the snoopers
Sniper range from what the truth is
Kongo with strong caduceus
Pile up the losers no time for choosing
When I get stupid bowels are moving
A hundred miles and cruising nigga
Im more than real dont bring the king hypothetical things
I push the button metal rings like a vending machine
Grew to be limitless few know what the business is
Beat odds with my regiment hesitance wont get you this
They say you gon reap what you sow
There aint no love here in this place that I call home
No one to lean on I been out here on my own
Dont need no haters round me fuckin up my zone
Youre well protected aint no better way to roam
Hand on my heater cause you never really know
Separate yourself they aint gon let you grow
I wanna win dont think the hood gon let me go oh
Uh sweeter life from here on out subtracted bitter faces
Minor disappointments stem from lack of expectations
Mediocre flows sick tracks infected basements
Bullets dropping knowledge power casings and down faces
This is what I get for living
My mental splitting back and forthing with my other side still two tempers clicking
Top fiver of all the forefathers who mentions different
Jotting punches down on blank blue bills new pens for tripping uh
Im downing Henny sets two clip Glock for semi threats
Time for many cheques too hiphop for skinny sweats
Feel my memory stretch do flip flops and deadly sex
Resemble MCs out the old days W Chevy Lex
An active rider fogging up the plaza as I
Float off the ramp and throw dab like Desiigner
Platinum juana psychopath and smoke
Cash out the commas my personas like the Ave would hope
Fast ride provider
They say you gon reap what you sow
There aint no love here in this place that I call home
No one to lean on I been out here on my own
Dont need no haters round me fuckin up my zone
Youre well protected aint no better way to roam
Hand on my heater cause you never really know
Separate yourself they aint gon let you grow
I wanna win dont think the hood gon let me go oh

1379,"Hate It or Love It GUnit Remix Lyrics
Yeah lets take em back
Uhhuh
Comin up I was confused my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy aint around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed Id get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs Id get the hat now thatd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggas had stole my bike
Different day same shit aint nothin good in the hood
Id run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate Id carry the heat for ya
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya GGGG for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my NWA gold
I had the whole crowd yellin Free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And Im raps MVP
Dont make me remind yall what happened in DC
This nigga aint Gotti he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouthtomouth
Hahaha
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
From the beginnin to the end losers lose winners win
This is real we aint got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change its stayin the same
How many of them boys is witcha
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
Im walking with a snub cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club til they coughin on the rug
Aint never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now its an RIP shirt in my coat
Now Im speedin reminiscin
Holdin my weed in never listen
If I see him Imma lift em
And maybe thatll even the score
But if not itll be me on the floor
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deucedeuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus rockin a leases
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God Im blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know Im still nice with my cook game
Look man its a hood thang thats why Im loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey Im still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put em in my fofive
And I aint even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who aint seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop

Where the niggas get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin mad coz they cant ride like I ride
Front n back dippin side to side
And its been like that since I was BG
Its the E thats what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this

So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you wanna ride nigga jump on in
Sip a cup o gin Aint no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggas be dealin

Gonna just say no this has gone too far
You better kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care
Mamas birth  isnt ready for this
You need to handle yours
This land is my land this land is your land
This land is my land youre sure man Sure
Cause Georgie wanna rage war on all fronts
And me Im a peace seeker when its all said and done
We got enough problems here why we messing with that
Politics in the mix and now were guessing again
Speculations as to whos a threat
Shoot shoot shoot em up Georgie cause youse a vet
Whos up next now I guess the Rootin Tootin
Invading and raiding is what youre used to doing
And I can understand war tactics
But without dialogue theres just more caskets
And everybodys scared to death
Turn on the news bad news be prepared to step
And there goes our favorite guy
George kissed the world and made it cry
Chorus
Georgie Georgie dont run Kissed the world made it cry
Gonna just say no this is gone too far Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care Mamas birth  isnt ready for this  
you need to handle yours
How dominating do you have to be
When it only ends up as a disaster G
After me there will be no more to warn you
There will be no emails no voice messages to inform you
That Georgies got a beef to settle
And you say no to weapons he says keep the medal
Sending troops of our native sons
Straight into battle no talking just blaze your guns
And Im from the home of the brave
You go against the mission youre gonna go in a grave
And thats the way Georgie wants it
Cause I dont think hes happy unless theres conflict
So many soldiers on the front line
Its getting tense everywhere when theyre in a crunch time
And there goes our favorite guy
Georgie kissed the world and made it cry
Chorus
Georgie Georgie dont run Kissed the world made it cry
Gonna just say no this is gone too far Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care Mamas birth  isnt ready for this  
you need to handle yours
Chorus
Georgie Georgie dont run Kissed the world made it cry
Gonna just say no this is gone too far Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care Mamas birth  isnt ready for this  
you need to handle yours
Chorus contd
Why do you want to do it like this I dont wanna  of your diss  
Kissed the world and made it cry Whyd you kiss my world good bye

Wed like to thank you in advance for purchasing this product
It is a Relativity Records product artist Fat Joe
My name is KRSOne
And of course were gonna bring THE noise
Cause we can never be toys
Yes I am the ultimate uttering ultimatums for the fun of it
It appears to me you dont know who you fucking with
You cant see this with bifocals cause youre local
Cant hang with my vocals better you fuck with Sonny Bono
Or Yoko Ono but KRS oh NO NO
You might think you all that but I dont give a fuck though
Im rolling hard like God for the squad black
Packin them poppers bitch where that money be at
Aiyo I be the show stopper as I shine like gold
Other rappers dull like copper the certified fake nigga dropper
Which borough is the thorough
I know do you know Let me know Im sayin though
The coke connector sweating leathers with reflectors
Dont get caught up in my sector
Or Ima have to inject ya with a slab of this lyrical dope shit
Fake MCs and wannabes best to quote this
Fat Joe the true and living will prevail
Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale
Will I fail I doubt it
Im the nigga catching bodies while other niggas fantasize about it
True indeed behind my back MCs claim they can serve me
In my face they screaming Were not worthy
Youse a has been actually you aint been
I be touring while you be home taping
So what punk you could battle in a second
Frankly the bottom line is wheres your hit record
You claim Im jocking claim Im on your dick wheres your witnesses
If Im on your dick my name has got to be syphilis
If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck Jeru
Up up up and away cuz I dont play clown Kool G Rap
If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck Jeru
Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down Kool G Rap
As we proceed to lock it down dont get it fucked up
We be the kings of the Boogie Down
All we do is spark izm and get cash
Torturing MCs like that warden up in Alcatraz bo bo bo bo 
Its Fat Joe yo you know my steelo
Get so much love Im payin sixteen on a kilo
Sending niggas outta town still got control of the Boogie Down
Now how the fuck you sound Yeahhh 
Aint no army that could harm me or bomb me
Cmon G you clowns aint got a fucking thing on me
Im flashy like white linen tell em 
Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the 9th inning
Im down with Kris and aint no stopping me
Im out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me
Its My Philosophy puffing Ls in the corridor
Slapping cops like hitting whores in my laborator
These motherfuckers dont want it
Word to mother Joe these niggas dont want it 
If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck Jeru
Up up up and away cuz I dont play clown Kool G Rap
If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck Jeru
Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down Kool G Rap
Mercy you wanna serve me but you aint worthy
My style is too curvy what you telling me
Bet your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and fondle your balls
With KRSOne up in your memory
I know your kind you act like
Youre Mr John Gotti the Don but youre just another bwotty mon
Telecro bwotty mon how you collect
Rap magazine dating back to Tougher than Leather
The only reason you got such an extensive rap collection
Cause most of your rap mags are all stuck together
Watch what you say watch what you said
When your skull gets cracked what you gonna say crackhead
Your file is dead kneel to the rap God in bed
Before I slap you way Back in the Days like Ahmad
Dont get me fed up or vexed up cause youll get set up
My crew dont let up I be dead up in this piece tell em 
Recognize its BlastMaster KRSOne
For ten years Fat Joe chillin on the East

Who dont be knowin my name I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide make ya slip make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit I DJ like Quik
The top notch of the block cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks Im hot so give up the props
My style is hummin comin at ya duck or get backed up
Dispatcher Red get freaky to the rapture
So come on light the buddha check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew to the check aone two
Its you who Redman with the kung fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the rough neck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables I roast your whole record label kids
Yo E Whats up G 
Bridge
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby Press rewind if I havent blown your mind 
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby Press rewind if I havent blown your mind 
I do the hustle like Russell Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom makes me poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra pop more pop than CocaCola
Next to Yoda Im a star at war plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up girl
Come on and get it if you with it troop
Krush groovin smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit cause Im cautious about lawsuits
PsychoBetaPFunk got styles hard as tree trunks
For real punk you got a blunt light it cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being watch me freak it in Korean
Redman
forget it
I rip shop in hiphop I get props my lip rocks
The rap stuffs more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I havent blown your mind Rewind 
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby Press rewind if I havent blown your mind 
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby Press rewind if I 
Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
Cause I cut your freakin eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
Its the Funkadelic Redman
And I hit ya with the Funkadelic level the PFunk the devil
The spectacular Blacula bust holes like Dracula
Load up a course more legend than Acura
Im swift I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung cause I freak it with the tongue
Cause I can wax on wax off like Danielsan
Do the yea yea boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard word to Herb
Cause I macaframalama
Plus I kick the grammar straight from New Jers

Yo hold your breath while I explode

Chin wheel pull out Ah shit three finger ring fat ass link Stanley and a big booty go bitch to with it
Man fuck all that
Break em off something
Aha its really sad
Young brothers and sisters today have a lack of understanding on
What it really means to be Black
Could you tell me who unleashed our animal instinct Uh 
And the white man sittin there tickled pink No shit 
Laughin at us on the avenue
Bustin caps at each other after havin brew
We cant enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous at each others wealth Right right 
But comin ups just in me
But the Black community is full of envy Oh shit 
Too much backstabbin
While I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood Yup 
Build a store and sell their goods
To the county recips
You know us po niggas nappy hair and big lips Thats right 
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out Shit 
We aint nothin but porch monkeys to the average bigot redneck honky
You say comin up is a must
But before we can come up take a look at us
You dumb ass nigga
Break em off something
And all yall dopedealers
Youre as bad as the police cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin dope
But you aint built us a supermarket So shit 
So when can spend our money with the Blacks
Too busy buyin gold and Cadillacs Huh 
Thats what ya doin with the money that ya raisin
Exploitin us like the Caucasians did Yup 
For 400 years I got 400 tears for 400 peers
Died last year from gangrelated crimes
Thats why I got gangrelated rhymes Right 
But when I do a show to kick some facts
Us Blacks dont know how to act
Sometimes I believe the hype man
We mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
But dont point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon Hip Hop wont be so nice
No Ice Cube just Vanilla Ice Man fuck that 
And youll sit and scream and cuss
But theres no one to blame but us
Yeah but why is it that one motherfucker can ruin it for twentytwo thousand motherfuckers
When they wanna come see a good jam you know what Im sayin
Ayy Cube tell em something shit you know how I feel
Break em off something
Us well always sing the blues
Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
And if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
Cause Ill beat you down like it aint nothin
Just like a beast
But Im the first nigga to holler out peace black man
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hogmogs and chitlins
Bet my money on the dice or the horses
Jobless so Im a ho for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
With a picture of a blueeyed Jesus
They used to call me Negro
After all this time Im still bustin up the chiffarobe
No respect and ignored
And Im havin more babies than I really can afford
In jail cause I cant pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of us but yall think its dumb of me
To hold a mirror to ya face but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about

1137,"Doo Wop That Thing  Gordons dub LyricsYo remember back on the bully when cats used to harmonize like
Wooo wooo wooo
Yo yo my men and my women dont forget about the Deen
The Sirat alMustaqim yo
Its about a thing
Yo yo yo if you feel real good lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah yeah
Put them up put them up
Put them up put them up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Its been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Member when he told you he was bout the Benjamins
You act like you and him then give him a little trim
To begin how you think you really goin to pretend
Like you wasnt down when you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even foolin him
If you did it then then youd probably again
Talking out your neck saying youre a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Whore you going to tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass cause youre thinking its a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine
Dont be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now Lauryn is only human
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
Its silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans come again
Yo Awhen when come again yeah yeah 
When when come again yeah yeah 
My friend come again yeah yeah 
Guys you know youd better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Dont care who they offend popping yin Like you got Yen 
Lets stop pretend the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men still living in his mothers basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child supports late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
Unh unh come again
Yo yo come again
Brethren come again
Sistren come again

Hey we have some very intelligent women in here man
Do you think you too young to really love somebody
No no no no no
I say it for me and I am adult and I say wait you too young to be in love
This is silly you infatuated with them
You got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I dont know
It is a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody
Well you tell me whats the difference
Whats the difference
You can love anybody but when you in love with somebody
You looking at it like this
You taking that person for what he or she is
Not matter what he or she look like
And no matter what he or she do
If you can fall in love you can fall out of love
You might stop being in love with that person but you cant stop loving that person
Sometimes they never been loved before they never been in love before
They dont know the feeling to be loved
She poetic
She killed you
We get in that conversation with that right

2044,"What if the hunger was missin What if the passion was gone
If were truthfully speakin never saw it lastin this long
If the words didnt rhyme what would I do for a livin
But Ive been dead for so long I figure Im due for some livin
They only see the effects never pay no mind to the cause
My thinking is so complex simplicity can get lost
What if everybody was real and I wasnt surrounded by frauds
The moral in that is so priceless just cause I know what it costs
Lookin back damn near every problem I had it
Never got em retracted
I combat it problematic every problem of an addict
But thats just the way the cards fell
Heartfelt but can you be cheated if God dealt
Fuck this shit only regret that I have is ever bein regretful
I mean they all tried to kill me none of them were successful
A few I knew for some years some never met me and tried
But you cant kill nothin thats ready to die
They say I live my own way own way and thats fine
Im just livin my own way own way like I cant die
They cant remove my heart my soul might take its toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way no way let em all try
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
And now Im feelin like Steven when he was up in that hospital
Nigga shot him nine times they got him thinkin illogical
Crippled feelin immortal he cheated death he unstoppable
He just want that revenge nigga feel like dyings impossible
They want me to regress like I aint been through the worst
Instead of me bein blessed they want me pinned in that dirt
If you knew me in the past you would think my winnings deserved
They never noticed my path and all the sins I did first
Both my parents did drugs see they put them syringes to work
And I carry that same exact gene but I never mention Im cursed
Those prescriptions were murder I blame it all on that nurse
She started my relapse way back I developed a thing for them percs
Fuck this shit only regret that I have is ever bein regretful
Them fuckin pills tried to kill me none of them were successful
I close my hands on my knees send these words to the sky
You cant kill nothin thats ready to die fuck this shit
Say I live my own way own way and thats fine
Im just livin my own way own way like I cant die
They cant remove my heart my soul might take its toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way no way let em all try
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
See Im so self destructive hurt anyone that come near
Done it my whole career was always one of her fears
Hurt her so much in the past Im supposed to be healin her
But she love me so much she say that its only killin her
Now she say she cant watch it pill poppin its toxic
Promised her I would stop it just go hide when I pop it
Its a shame we can never be the same wasnt prideful
How can I tell you Im nowhere near finished bein suicidal
Baby that wasnt me just some nigga that smelled like me
Fuck like you stuck by some nigga that felt like me
You watched me lose weight you just waited there helplessly
You just offerin help to me I just dissed at you selfishly
When you left I condemned you really I should commend you
Not for havin that in you but for havin the strength to
I make amends to you now you shouldnt have seen me that high
I killed you when you wasnt ready to die
Say I live my own way own way and thats fine
Im just livin my own way own way like I cant die
They cant remove my heart my soul might take its toll
The air I breathe and the ground below

2674,"This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness
Come to micclubnet where you can read this
Run a plot on the map in hyperspatia
From the Society for Scientific Exploration
Color is vibration vibration is sound
Sound resonates through the mouth check it out
What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways
South South East West South West East
North North East North West
And the black and white images fade to grey sound waves
Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
With a bewildering array of lyrical display
The Best of Bis orbitally rearranged
Monoatomic elements with adept intelligence
The highest professorship my English etiquette
Compels me to not say it if I cant spell it bitch
My circularized third eye sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls
I read onefourth of the Library of Alexandria
Before it was burnt to the floor
I wish I couldve learned more
About the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw
They were new millennium but Euclidean in form
Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
Carved from Egyptian gold moulded in Assyria
With processed Beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
And thhey burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome
I talked to Mr Fuller over the phone
And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
Said he didnt want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems but Ill think about going
The process was slow and the dough was low
But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
Plus I aint never travelled that far from home
But I heard about the beauty of Cydonian snow
Neon green grass statues made from translucent glass
Ill be crazy to pass
I like Algerian Jazz
The blue twilight band that plays tunes from a laser black sax
It sounds so laid back it helps me relax
I brought the album after seeing KPax
Oh how I miss my nautilus
I was told pharyngoamygdalitis did not exist
You have a modest case of scaphocephalous
I prescribe some neogothic antibiotics
Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith
Deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin
From every angle the competition gets boxed in
As Dr C indoctrinates his doctrine
Translate the English alphabet to the omega text
Life is now and death is next
Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell
Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
These dark side tales might affect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
Use the aphrodisiac to get a female
Called Ginger tie her up and drink her ginger ale
Grand Marnier for me scotch on the rocks for you
Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoos
In the studio with James Lipton
Reminiscing about the script that was written before the beginning
All of a sudden the boos turned into applause
My jaws stronger than the Caninde Macaws
Cant even count the bars Ive expended so far
Dont want to rap no more its been so long
I wish the clock would hurry up and tick
Im out in the bush and the sticks humping a 100 clicks
Dr Scholls gave me a good fit
Me and him went to school together back in 86
When I was really ill
Putting Planck energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
You wanna laugh now and cast your belligerent doubt
Show you what poetry is really about
The side effects will make you pass out
Followed by skin rash itching diarrhoea nausea and dry mouth
You want a time out You better spit a rhyme out
Before the community of real MCs die out
College students say to me You aint smart
Record label ARs say This aint art
These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark
Listen to my chest beat tell me this aint heart
You gotta be as obsequious as the Disciples of Jesus
This is my Master Thesis

Trained other beings to be in his different levels of Hell

Aston Martin king Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
Im like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada stay mellow like lala
Young fresh with dollars ladies go gaga
Im the cumlada top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask pure religion and cash
From the windows that open Im raising my glass
Daylight beams night life schemes
This is my inception Im writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what Im born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through
Ohh in the sky well find the light
Ohh aint too high well shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right
It all started with a dream I wanted to be RunDMC
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M dreams were spoken to him
Thats when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes yes sir this is what Im made for
To go hard in the paint like D Wade or
D Rose from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care my music is the medicine
My name holds weight I am never hesitant
Different state resident this is hood elegance
SLS classic pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion now Im Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what Im born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through
Ohh in the sky well find the light
Ohh aint too high well shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right
Aye ayeaye aye aye hey
Aye ayeaye aye aye hey
Aye ayeaye aye aye hey Ayeayeayeaye aye 
Aye ayeaye aye aye hey Ayeayeaye aye aye aye 
Silhouettes of dreams that we had high huh
Even now it dont seem so bad ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
Im gone now imagine what Im gonna be
Dirty to worthy now Im all wordy
My broad up in Paris looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what Im born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldnt take that long to get me there
Keep running til I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how Im the one
Couldve been anywhere but Im sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh in the sky well find the light
Ohh until high well shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right

3572,"Yo how many people hear they alarm clock go off in the morning
You know what Im saying
And then you hit the snooze button
Its time to get up
Lotta cats still sleeping out there
Ya know what Im saying
They not on Subterranean
Watch this
Never denied better than Clyde I glide from the three
Third eye verbally Im certified with the beat
I drop one verse other cats be rhyming for weeks
Im thinking if he ever rest Ill be climbing his peaks
Rappers speak about how they packing nines on the beat
Pat him down thats the clown that be quiet in streets
Ask around blast around he crying for peace
Ironically Im getting down five times in the East
Every time I release classic material
You get a CD for ten but Ill sign it for free
Capitalism have my children dying for cheese
Damn fashion grand dragon be designing your jeans
Buckle pants sagging Uncle Sam taxing me describing the thief
Bar codes thats the sign of the beast
Now the latest pagan faces be the flyest MCs
Hands shaking like a Mason with the highest degrees
Buzzing off the Vitamin C no Heineken please
Gifted like the 25th dont have to light up the tree
Right of the free hiphop is Private Ryan to me
That means Im moving up to bank it while you lying asleep
Wake up 
Mothers crying Wake up 
Brothers dying Wake up 
Can you feel me Wake Up

Hard work sweat and bloodstains did it for chump change
I didnt really complain cause it was a love thing
Thats when I was a kid black now I know this fact
That love is gonna get you evicted from where you live at
Home is where the heart is yours I open with facts
I strike like when I swing first then you pitch black
Running round your diamonds and rings you thinking baseball
You in the box of unconscious Im tryna wake yall
Take yall from blind vision leave with divine wisdom
My ride rhythm never sideslippin my times tickin
I flow to the end used to hang mostly with friends
Now I keep my enemies closer than them
Cause I know how it is when theres fear in the sky
Weather change hella fangs wanna tear in your spine
I never really trusted cats that couldnt stare in my eye
No surprise yo even blessings wear a disguise
Sometimes Im riding in the hood me and my man saw
Some big teeth hands and feet yo that aint grandma
Big chains cars and clothes yo that aint hiphop
Spit your flow backwards huff and puff your blush but
You still aint big or bad enough to blow up my bridge spot
Excuse me if Im on some rude shit but fuck the flipflop
Just chilling building even at your show my hands deep in the pocket
Like Doug Williams cause yall wasnt thrilling

In search of right like the birth of Christ
Breakin every generational curse in life
Perverse concise make sure the verse is right
Return who adverse to the Earth
Make sure that my hearse is white
And the contract Jewish to match a grind thats foolish
A Quran thats Buddhist
Rappin so Mike Caren and Denaun stack moolah
As I sign on the dotted line with the passion of a blind tattooist
In reaction to slithers from lizards mouth
Yelawolf this is your first and your last pass
I aint gon put it on blast your punk ass know what this about
You think its bout being loud or tryna be hostile
Til you get found face down on the ground outside of Kid Rock house
Though you a vulture pundit I hope you get sober from this
Men lie women lie so do numbers
The energy never lies when you a overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer
I dont rhyme for the likes Im who the jealous target
Im underground for life this shit is a sellers market
The rich get richer the po get mo greedy
We need Clarance A to get whats owed in these board meetings
Rappers catch Ls after just squeezing em four Feezys
Crackers pattern themselves after the teachings of Morris Levy
But I was dubbed the greatest by the gossip
Im King Tut to haters from this Spyder cockpit
Its Jacob custom makes me fire watches
Inspired by Cool J drivin Saabs
With Cut Creator right beside him drivin Mazdas
I was labeled drugrelated by the coppers
A government that through the republic
Has been subjugated by the mobsters
Martin got shot on the Lorraine balcony became alchemy
Was spit on at the hospital when suffocated by the doctors
Michael was sniped at six at night precisely by a laser
Mac Miller died pleadin for his life reciting Gods prayer
Immaculately conceived the product of Nas labor
Aint shit like me Im Chris Lighty Im Violator
Dedicated to the edification of sellin blackness
I feel like Dame yellin at Kevin Liles over leather jackets
Prince when he told Nas Own your masters or you ass out
Best rapper between Cardi and Meg Thee Stallion is Kash Doll
Overcomer
This Detroit energy Im on forever
Shout out to everybody who made it out Overcomer 
And remember God doesnt call the qualified
He qualifies the called thats Christine Caine
Overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer Overcomer 
The energy never lies when you a overcomer Overcomer 
Oh yeah
The station that keeps you in the groove
SaintTropez

Keepin it cool laughin with friends family

3571,"Its on
Where they at where they at where they at
I sold tapes every day me and Freddy B
Been famous since 1983
Give me ten dollars and you straight get blessed
A rap all about you called the special request
Oakland you know I go way back
To Cougnuts fast Stangs and Cadillacs
When homeboys put Vogues on any car
With 6 by 9s smoking burners
Everybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat
Whole town fucked around and started smoking D
Every rap I ever made was about this town
I made 7 whole albums with no James Brown
And even though I love his music I just cant stand
The way they used it all up and didnt pay the man
And after 2 platinum albums you call me weak
Cause I dont sell records in the East
Now whats funky I say pussy on an old ho
I guess yall fools dont know
Why some good rappers cant sell no tapes
Its not the companys fault the shit sounds fake
You wanna be in the trunk with the booming box
While the young bitches ride on your jock
You cant do it like this homey so just pass it
And stop kissing them white folks asses
Its like you smoked a whole damn key
You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat
Im from the old school I love PFunk
But now rap music is all that they want
So when Im in my car I play Clinton
And when Im on the stage I start pimping
And when I hear your shit I push eject
Then I throw it out the window with the rejects
And when the hard core rappers go soft
I like to watch when they ass fall off
Cause aint nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC
And any other rappers ever talk about me
I dont stop rapping thats all they can say
And how I dogg bitches every day
But if you cant be a dogg then youre weak
You be phony like a side show freak
Some rappers try to come off positive
Where Im from that just aint how it is
They say rap music is here to stay
But the sucka MCs dont think that way
It took 8 long years before I got my break
So I wonder why rappers make fake ass tapes
You wont get paid like I did so give up punk
And while youre in the studio Im in the trunk
You got no choice so dont flip that coin
This aint the military so you punks cant join
It aint pop its called underground rap
From Oakland California and the shit sounds phat
Im spitting raps to my motherfucking homies
Thats why they listen to the one and only
I used to be broke but now we all used to be
Got no game for a bitch all the game is for me
And these bitches cant say shit to me
They could never could fuck with Short baby
Im not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style
Dont dress hip hop and dance real wild
But I do sell records like a motherfucker
Even though you might Im just another sucka
I find the beat and then never switch
Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch
You want rent money I got pimp money
One things for sure I wont give it to a ho
I throw a bitch in the God damn trunk
And start slamming that Oakland funk
Short Doggs in the house once again
Trying to fade the platinum with Shorty the Pimp
And when I do Im going straight to the bank
Withdraw some money and buy some dank
You cant relate to my motherfucking homies
Thats why they listen to the one and only
I grew up on the funk called P
But these motherfuckers growing up on me
And if I ego trip and my head is fucked
I take my ass back to where I grew up
And get real boy its never too late
Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape
Im in the trunk
In the trunk in in the trunk
In the trunk in in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block
In the trunk in in the trunk
In the trunk in in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block

2970,"Gotta move on
Gotta let go
Wouldve opened my eyes if I wouldve known
After all of this time
Took my heart to mend
That Id turn around and be broken again
2x 
They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen
On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin
She rescued me my heroine to the end
But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep I would tie a shoestring
Tap five times to find a vein in there
Squeeze 7ccs so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So I guess they just wasnt seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one an indivisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education beautiful weather
Dam was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor
Her skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came
So humiliated started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and
Im relocated in Alabama now
That Maalox and Mylanta now
And it wont stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers how
I could kiss the sky without enhancing
But its so hard to learn

202,"I know theres a first time for everything
First time I let her in my bed she got wetter then the perfect storm
That we weathering together and
This the first time that Ive ever considered wedding rings
But first things first yo
I met her at the bar rolling with three wise men like I followed the star
There she is shorty bi coastal
Thick like bifocals stacked like 2Pac vocals her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so Im romancing the stone
The rhythm is to the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest and Ill fly make you testify
Damn baby I know we got some haters and
I dont care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I used to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this aint what Im used to seeing
Because I never been in love before
You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the beautiful struggle
Now baby tell whats it gonna take to prove that I love you
When Im gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening to
Dont get it confused Im trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this its like a miracle you
You You stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I took above its clear skies thats surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and Im down to serve lets deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo
Here we go
I dont care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I used to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this aint what Im used to seeing
Because I never been in love before
You looked good when I tried you on
So I had to write a song
Use to be the guy that always made her cry when Im gone
Always kept a stable and I never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone why
Im never home scared of commitment
Ready to forever roam
We at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to RIP Proceeds my name up on the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes
Dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them do you I dont care who she speaking with
Because I already know she made it clear who she leaving with
And it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you aint no groupie ho
Sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something that you should know
I know we got some haters and
I dont care what people say

2871,"Mr Big Lyrics
Now I was broke as a muthafucka my life at the end see
My so called friends they had no ends to lend me
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin me with no grease
I worked so fuckin hard but the money it never increased
I quit my fuckin job I had no job nigga
Put on the mask get the gloc its time to rob nigga
I hit the streets but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous but my fear wouldnt stop my strollin
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets so I knew I had got bucked
Reachin for my tech some niggas kicked me in my chest
My eyes closed shut and I thought I seen death
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
TMoney walked in and he told me what had happened
I knew him from the hood but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag and I knew that he was bale
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech
He offered me a job said hed front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be
Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
I hit the street slanging yayo then I sold up my block
Sellin 8 sellin deals sellin 20 rocks
Sellin dimes sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack
Some nigga tried to jack me but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches life
Standin on the track my mobile rung and it was T
Hello Yo Eight be the fuck aroung 3 Aight
I met him at the park he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians and get my ass in
Hit for 30 birds if I live Id get five
I smoked them damn Columbians and then got what was mine
Over time my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger thats when bitches started jockin me
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5O
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope makin a 100 Gs a week
I gained respect Im the biggest playa of all time
Dont ever fuck with me cause Im 
Mr Big
Repeat chorus
Chillin at the club with TMoney and JB
Lil Adrian and Boo and my nigga MJG
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds
Drinkin on this Yak makin my way to the back
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest
With a long black weave and a tight red dress
I started conversatin but she didnt want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up now somethin in the air stank
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser
Stood by the door when it opened niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun Hey nigga pow pow
Then I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in I was laying on the bed
Walked up out the room did I go to jail
Hell no They cant stop me
Long live Mr Big Ho
Repeat chorus

Remember P the one you got your rhyme style from
Yo its the P cut and scratched
Yo disperse from off this who the culprits
That claim to be the newest rappin bullshit
My rhymes get Ruger endorsements
My song boost Intratec sales through the ceiling
Lets talk with guns convos til the police come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
Burst macs like its Hamburger Hill for real
Its Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on
My outfit stuck on some wild out shit all about it
We move gambit through the overcrowded
Forthwith pull out long fifths extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc
Me and the cliqueah sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin write a new banger
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
Or the HAVOC nigga
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got the technique from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got your freestyle from

Unsolved the mob that revolves automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs

Me and you can have some fun make it a blast
You couldnt take the impact with steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood veteran covered in mud
Wounded in the midst of war still tradin slugs gettin major love
Way above you newcomers
I come thunderin with the heat of two summers
When I enter the zone move mountains with the presence alone
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You privatize home in but cant seem to clone
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Pun the one you bit your whole shit from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned

Froze you from ear to ear showin your whole vocal

In your circle dont mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
I plead the fifth Hell no and No your honor
So the streets honor me humble believe Im on it
I grab my momma Im headed to a different genre
They couldnt understand me now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy crack greed homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight nothing recent
But Ima call the state for back pay they owe me grievance
And you cant knock that block the block with the top that
Open up that Fanta I got that
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need

For that white like Tommy and green paper with the ghosts
Thats power I play my post one day
Youre the best thing since sliced bread the next day youre toast
I can never be toast hell no

I like head by the coast as I stare at the pacific
She asked if I liked it Keep going girl youre terrific
Yeah baby see Im Clyde and Im looking for a Bonnie mami
To get a Gucci ghost watch rings from Avianne
I share my wealth humble beginnings hunger strangled us
Pops had a choice me or drugs he chose angel dust damn 
And the mother some was living more dangerous

Who macks the most shit smoke ya whole clique like roach clips
Who flows ramped enough to hold drips and float ships
No mo shifts
I hold enough chips to toast Cris
Its G Rap the cat thats on your wanted most list
I wrote this so you could sweat this and soak this
Get the focus the made family kid not the bogus
Youre crime culprits put hot shit up in you like holsters
Left for the vultures with DTs picking up cultures
Threethousand volt ya just like the third rail
And if you heard shells a herb fell swift with the words well
All on my dirt trail
Kick up enough dust to hurt cells
Swerve the SL so get G murk swell the shirt braille
Curved in jail cells for jakes that wanna Hblock those
Niggas in Pacos keep the block froze and the shop closed
Where the pots grow with young cats coppin the drop Roves
Get the Nachos so no cops show when the shots blow
Shit red hot though
Streets remain flooded with Ds
Bundling Kis to maintain a hundred degrees
Main crime wave we handle a beef in 9 ways
Get your mind grazed from TEC9 sprays your spine blazed
When it get too hot on the block better believe the rhyme pays
Put all you cats in cradles if you crave to find graves
Diamond mind crazed rays blindin you with my shine glaze
Unlike them other rappers that get stuck in a time phase

Fifty Caliber gat embracing
Leavin you wit legs without sensation
Whos full of malice Who thug the wildest
Act childish get your body sent to a stylist
Who live the foulest
Be grippin cannons till my hands are callused
Pile this paper longer than mail list from New York to Dallas
Purchase a palace sip coladas with the whole Borgata
Bodies be dropped while I attend the opera
Land on casino roofs in helicopters
In Las Vegas Nevada
Cant stop until I got a casa up in Trump Plaza
929 Mazda foreign chicks talking with accents like they Zsa Zsa
Mean like Idi Amin Dada
Thug saga
Slugs burn you like they lava
You and your bimbo get hit up through your car window
See you an drift slow and let ten blow
From out the darkest shadow
Remain straight as the archers arrow
I spark this barrel hit my target
Even if the mark is narrow
Lay you like a pharaoh
With fragments inside your bone marrow
Get your wig flown just like a sparrow

3645,"She was on her way to becomin a college graduate
Wouldnt even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of Latina Id sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit her love was never for hire
Disciplined intellectual beauty is what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me kickin it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought she didnt mess with broke kids
The thug niggas always talkin about how they smoke kids
But the rich sniffcoke kids got no play
Im not even interested is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way gave up tryin to get in it
It didnt matter how good your game was she wasnt with it
On the block bitches was jealous but wouldnt admit it
Talk shit and deny to everyone that they did it
Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except McDonalds and diddick
Smokin weed with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it
She spoke intelligently and they bit it always tryin to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
She had a style all her own respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her and there wasnt a cure
Dont you know that time waits for no man
My fate its all planned
Im blessed just to know you
Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
Cant find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again Id never let you go
Hold tight to your love cause you never know
Her eyes are brown and beautiful yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally and she was glad
That I wasnt just another nigga tryin to get in it
So every now and then wed stop and talk for a minute
I didnt have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousins baby shower
We talked about power to the people and such
We spent more time together but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel
I was too interested in keepin it real
Perfectly honest and complete
She would always call me cario and never Technique
Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks
Forever changin the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me to stop hangin out on the streets
To stop robbin and stealin from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
Museo del Barrio and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true
I couldnt live without her so I told her facin my fears
But honeys only response was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically holdin me tight
I tried to speak but she wouldnt stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didnt burn I turned cold after that night
Dont you know that time waits for no man
My fate its all planned
Im blessed just to know you
Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
Cant find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again Id never let you go
Hold tight to your love cause you never know
I went on with my life college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the COs talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near
At night in my cell Id close my eyes and Id see her
Hold her close in my dreams but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole
In the summer came back intact and on track
But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold
Even after my mother hugged me cryin at home
My real niggas would catch me thinkin outta my zone
Fuckin lots of different women but I still felt alone
Relatively wellknown around the New York underground
But I kept thinkin of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically somehow it was still there
I had to do somethin because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin cocaine
Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta
But her facial expression changed
When I asked about her daughter
Dont you know that time waits for no man
My fate its all planned
Im blessed just to know you
Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
Cant find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again Id never let you go
Hold tight to your love cause you never know
She told me that there was a note for me that was left behind
And she had left it there waitin for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swellin up in her eye and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was and I started thinkin the worst
Reversed my position stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope
With my name on the floor Nobody loves you more than me cario is what the letter said
By the time you get to read this Ill probably be dead
But when you left in 97 a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me to see what true love really does
Cause even though we never made love
You were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought
You made me want to believe
And then I slipped up and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby dont you see
I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hope didnt exist for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin I wish I couldve given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that youll meet me in Paradise inevitably
No matter what Ill keep your love forever with me
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishin that I was dead instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel and now you know why Technique dont fuckin fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if theyre next to you
The one you love not the person thatll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond
Cause you never really know what you got until its gone

different after you do a bid The way your life done changed While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin cocaine Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta But her facial expression changed When I asked about her daughter Dont you know that time waits for no man My fate its all planned Im blessed just to know you Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night Cant find a reason why God came between you and I And if I had the chance again Id never let you go Hold tight to your love cause you never know She told me that there was a note for me that was left behind And she had left it there waitin for such a long time I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first I saw a tear swellin up in her eye and then she cursed She told me where the letter was and I started thinkin the worst Reversed my position stepped over and opened the door And sure enough there was an envelope With my name on the floor Nobody loves you more than me cario is what the letter said By the time you get to read this Ill probably be dead But when you left in 97 a part of me went to Heaven I thank God at least I got to know what love really was But it hurt me to see what true love really does Cause even though we never made love You were all that there was It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave You made me doubt the way I thought You made me want to believe And then I slipped up and I let you get close to me It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be Baby dont you see I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV Hope didnt exist for me since late in 1993 I died a virgin I wish I couldve given myself to you I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you Promise that youll meet me in Paradise inevitably No matter what Ill keep your love forever with me What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur But I remember wishin that I was dead instead of her She was buried on August 3rd The story ends without a sequel and now you know why Technique dont fuckin fall in love with people Hold the person that you love closely if theyre next to you The one you love not the person thatll simply have sex with you Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond Cause you never really know what you got until its gone,She was on her way to becomin a college graduate Wouldnt even stop to talk to the average kid The type of Latina Id sit and contemplate marriage with Fuck the horse and carriage shit her love was never for hire Disciplined intellectual beauty is what I desire Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez Everyone told me kickin it to her was hopeless At first I just thought she didnt mess with broke kids The thug niggas always talkin about how they smoke kids But the rich sniffcoke kids got no play Im not even interested is what her body language would say Everyone around the way gave up tryin to get in it It didnt matter how good your game was she wasnt with it On the block bitches was jealous but wouldnt admit it Talk shit and deny to everyone that they did it Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it And no one ever gave them shit except McDonalds and diddick Smokin weed with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it She spoke intelligently and they bit it always tryin to copy But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy She had a style all her own respectful and pure I was sick in the head for her and there wasnt a cure Dont you know that time waits for no man My fate its all planned Im blessed just to know you Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night Cant find a reason why God came between you and I And if I had the chance again Id never let you go Hold tight to your love cause you never know Her eyes are brown and beautiful yet empty and sad I used to talk to her occasionally and she was glad That I wasnt just another nigga tryin to get in it So every now and then wed stop and talk for a minute I didnt have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers Then I took her out to dinner after her cousins baby shower We talked about power to the people and such We spent more time together but it was never enough I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel I was too interested in keepin it real Perfectly honest and complete She would always call me cario and never Technique Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks Forever changin the expression of my thoughts when I speak It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks She convinced me to stop hangin out on the streets To stop robbin and stealin from people like you Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo Museo del Barrio and the Metropolitan too Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true I couldnt live without her so I told her facin my fears But honeys only response was a face full of tears She could only sob hysterically holdin me tight I tried to speak but she wouldnt stop until I left sight I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light Except I didnt burn I turned cold after that night Dont you know that time waits for no man My fate its all planned Im blessed just to know you Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night Cant find a reason why God came between you and I And if I had the chance again Id never let you go Hold tight to your love cause you never know I went on with my life college and my career Ended up locked up like an animal for a year Where the COs talk to you like they were the overseer Then I got sent to

3378,"Just gotta get these thoughts off real quick
See Im a thinker its like thinking shit
Its when you got
You sittin there reflectin thinkin shit
I peep it though
Look you liked me better before you knew my history
Before you knew who I was
Thats when reachin our potential felt likely
Nobody like me
Besides see if I stop bein who I am
Im straight to it who I might be
But you gotta look inside each song
Thats where I proved it was really in sight all along
Bear it all so the privacy gone
Grab the pen sit down and write these wrongs
Just how I right these wrongs but look
You liked me better when I spoke usin censorship
Before you knew I was really insensitive
That was back when it was you and me
Then curiosity killed you you had to Google me
Now I wont call the headlines a liar
Some are true and some are false thats for yall to decipher
But look on rare occasions some of what they sayll bother me
I liked it better when the Net was still a novelty
Cause now people who aint found themselves
Get an outlet yet dont know how they sound themselves
They like me better when Im silent and dont have an opinion
Pretendin to blend in like Im a minion
Say if Joe keep talkin that shit hell get him shot
But if rappers cant tie my shoes how can I not
Thought I had my citys support I couldnt believe
Jersey City liked me better when I couldnt leave
I take it back that aint set in stone
They more so had weapons drawn cause I left alone
I liked it better when I had nothin to lose
The days when I felt like I had somethin to prove
Shit even for me thats unusual
If you dont give a fuck then who you gotta prove it to
Just the world that I was born in
You gotta learn to form wins against the storm wind
They like me better when I fuck and never call again
Without it they dont know what type of box I belong up in
They like me better without reality television
Guess they didnt need to witness the hell I was livin
In my shoes you too would seal a fate
Poppin 20 pills a day somebody gon feel a way
Look uh and so these hoes just to pass time
After the past time they dont even pass my mind
You liked me better way before you got lied to
But that dont really matter when you want me inside you
Your friends sayin leave they dont know that you tried to
You cant speak to them Im the nigga you cry to
I liked it better when nobody ever heard of me
Fore pop had to get that knee surgery
Guess that affected his bladder
So when Jackie called me nothin else really mattered
Was scared sounded frantic I aint want no parts of that
Said the ambulance came might be a heart attack
Was leavin work nearly cryin on the phone
Im in rush hour traffic just seen you dyin alone
Look I just pictured all the places that we never went
All the texts that were never sent
All the words we never spoke
Time we never shared rewind so we can repair
Such an inspiration all the holes that you dug through
Then you got released God was watchin above you
Im thinkin you healin I dont wanna disrupt you
So Im right back to never tellin you that I love you
And I dont wanna act that way
If I take somethin for granted I dont wanna give it back that way
Forreal thats how shit get lost let me chill
I like it better when Im not talkin over my thoughts now listen
Ive done been down been down its all for you
How you feelin out there
And I dont wanna get in your way
How everybody doin alright
Get you somethin to drink
And I dont wanna get in your way
Get you somethin to smoke get you somethin to light up
Whatever your vice is we here though
Said this love is all for you
That shit dont be for everybody man
Said this love is all for you
Now the singers wanna rap the rappers wanna sing
Personally I liked it better back when rappin was a thing
Cause now if you wanna get the high notes
When that hook come you gotta hit the high notes
The label wanna sell singles
Im sellin a story and thatll just taint the message
Bad marriage we aint got the same objective
Still Im here cause real niggas in the game respect it
Look they like it better when I let em live rent free
I never knew that once it stopped wed be enemies
And though I come off as heartless nigga
In spite of yourself got love for you regardless nigga
Now listen I liked you better when you wasnt in the spotlight
Was too addicted to it said some shit was not right
So when you work so much I couldnt complain
Til I learnt she was gateway escapin from the pain
The strippers talk to me like Im their therapist
That scares the good girls away dont know the hell I get
Whatever thoughts you contrive I cant help you with
But youve been tossin it for a year and I derail the shit
Im self made I dont do what Im told
The type that needs free reign to be out of control
Forreal cause when thats gone Im lost let me chill
I like it better when Im not talkin over my thoughts word
Ive done been down been down its all for you
Yall dont understand me
I dont think they get it though
And I dont wanna get in your way
Dont know why you dont apply like our experiences and shit
And I dont wanna get in your way
To like my experiences with other people
Said this love is all for you this love is all for you ooh
Said this love is all for you

knew my history Before you knew who I was Thats when reachin our potential felt likely Nobody like me Besides see if I stop bein who I am Im straight to it who I might be But you gotta look inside each song Thats where I proved it was really in sight all along Bear it all so the privacy gone Grab the pen sit down and write these wrongs Just how I right these wrongs but look You liked me better when I spoke usin censorship Before you knew I was really insensitive That was back when it was you and me Then curiosity killed you you had to Google me Now I wont call the headlines a liar Some are true and some are false thats for yall to decipher But look on rare occasions some of what they sayll bother me I liked it better when the Net was still a novelty Cause now people who aint found themselves Get an outlet yet dont know how they sound themselves They like me better when Im silent and dont have an opinion Pretendin to blend in like Im a minion Say if Joe keep talkin that shit hell get him shot But if rappers cant tie my shoes how can I not Thought I had my citys support I couldnt believe Jersey City liked me better when I couldnt leave I take it back that aint set in stone

2835,"Back in the 70s it was all about drugs 
Tie my arm up at night between shows
Takin soda tops off of soda pops
I used to be up all night in the living room
Smokin a lot of weed with the Four Tops
Makin collect calls back home to my pops
My little brother said Keith you need to stop
I knew something was wrong
When I gave away my VHS and sold a pair of my socks
The IRS callin me gettin on my nerve I was warned by Redd Foxx
My girl Keith you seen my diamond rings in the jewelry box
I dont know last night you and Chaka Khan was in here sniffin blow
I was in the room sweatin thinkin about the rent playin bingo
The landlord said the first of the month we gotta go
Packed up my bag and met Darryl Strawberry in the mall
I told James Brown stop smokin angel dust and the pistal
He wanted to go up to the Olive Garden and start a resteraunt brawl
Mary J Blige my son dont accept them type of phone calls
I cant come out tonight my Bic lighter dont light
I heard you and KCi in the background
Im screamin did the cops come and break up the fight
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs drugs
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs
Freebasin eighteen pounds of coke with Marvin Gaye
Put that on the table lets parlay
With Smokey Robinson and Bootsy lightin aluminum foil
Watch that crack pipe boil
With Richard Pryor we burned the house down gettin higher
Dont think Im bluffin
Meet Tommy Lee Curtis Keith Richards Eddie Kingwards and David Ruffin
Rick James was in the kitchen lightin the flame
And Mouseys trapped with Cuba Gooding Sr
I dont want nobody to know my name
I kept glasses on it was a damn shame
Losin weight fallin out in big arenas
The same guy who used to deal to me
Deals to Whitney and Bobby meet Ike and Tina
Every Saturday mansions was packed Hey Jimmy you got the smack
Shut up You dont know how to act
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs drugs
All the crack and the drugs make me feel the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs
Crystal methane and heroin and quaaludes
A relapse of your mind
Angel dust ecstasy sniffin coke baby
Got the best of meheeeheeeee
I got rits withdrawals my symptoms of pain
Rush me to the hossspitallll

2164,"People aint eating they say the reason
Resources depleted for the defense
Im offended by these authentic liars
Shouldve been retired let me identify them
Youll never get me quiet my people been inspired
Im the little fire flickering within the riot
Feel it vibrate shake awake sleeping giant
Keep them vibrant and vital and reenergize them
Our times arriving our shine is blinding
They cry were violent demonize it
Guys on the wrong side of right find us frightening
Pray lightning strike twice ice on their eyelids
Isis Osiris Christ in his likeness
Day of resurrection bring life to the lifeless
Tear the wall down pull a crown of a tyrant
Rebuild gentrify the planet for the righteous
He who sacrifices for the greater good
Elevate them where they should to the title of your highness
Only tribe surviving is the pious pious
United by the mighty human life tie that bind us
Hunger find kindness minds find refinement
The sightless guided by the blind are the blindest
We read the signs inscribed in the horizon
Bright yellow shot through the night time fajr
Oh thank you master for my soul
Lord hold me close dont let me go
Oh thank you master for my soul
Lord hold me close dont let me go
The long suffering long for relief
The hard working meek still drowned in grief
Houses are seized and they tossed in the street
The orphans of greed in the culture of deceit
Strong hunt the weak and the poverty steep
Wages dropping beneath yet the cost still increase
Officers deep keep force of police
The fourheaded beast wild all off the leash
Hardhearted beast with a jaw full of meat
Engulfed in a feast while you starve at his feet
He toss you the least little portion of a piece
To the floor and expect you to rejoice when you eat
Survival can seem the impossible feat
But you roll up your sleeves and you sow all your seeds
Toil in the soil but youre not allowed to reap
So you toss and you scream like a horrible dream
Woke out your sleep got you forced to your feet
Feel the pulse of your people in the heart when it beat
The vultures they keep bringing halt to your peace
Pull the sword out the sheath keep the wolves off of the sheep

Head down pussy pussy poppin
Head down pussy pussy poppin
Head down pussy pussy poppin
Head down pussy poppin on a handstand
On a handstand
On my american banstands
Summersalts cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing
Chinese splitssplits slide on down that polepole
And feel this dick getin outa controltrol
Oh no keep goin till a nigga like me say stoooop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it droooop
Tuck and twist its your luck if you fuckin Cris
Im rubbin clits so stay in catch dont try to duck and miss
Bitch Do your stretches dont pull no hamstrings
You got me movin infact your doin the damn thang
Stronger muscles exersize every part of your body hurts
Lets do this sweatin thank God your bath and body works
I like a woman who makes her own doe dont need a lot of help
But your heartll melt if I put a thousand in your garder belt
Lipgloss traces your pierced in 11 places
And your lips down town just made some familiar faces like WOAH
Imma send a chapter to this pussy poppin legacy
Shawna be that Bitch cant no bitches come fuck wit me
When I pop that cris im on that business and bubbly
When im in that 6 wit 20s spinin on luxury
Cuz I got that head game
Fuckin up that bed frame
But dont get me wrong now shawty gon let that lead aim
Better learn that game shawty
Better get yo man shawty
Foe he endup tamed and be gone all in the brain shawty
This pimpin futuristic
This business so expensive
The way I brake it down for you bitches its so exquisite
Let it go now front back watch me drop it like that
Show me where that money at
Boy come wit them 100 stacks
Now break in wit that pussy poppin
That pussy droppin to the flo
And got these niggas slobbin he wantin mo
Wit out that doe popi aint nuttin happen
Cuz thats the show im from the go u get that pussy poppin
Stopin that pussy dropin GONE
Every time we hit the club
We at least 50 deep
Smokin purple pourin grichi got everybody geeked
At the club 7 days a week find DTP off in this bitch
That ho poppin dropin God damn shawty who is this
Redbone wit a scorpio tatted on her tummy
Im sittin slouched back in the chair stuntin waving money
And shawty start zig zaggin her derriere for me
A bowlegged throughbreded said her name was strawberry
Up her pussy she pushed in a whole bottle of Mo
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the floor
Here u deserve this doe now jump on stage and work the pole
Face down ass up ho hands on those
Now pop that couchie you know the procedure
If you want this cash gotta make that ass shake like a seziure
Either Magic or Pleasers
Find me spending cheese up

955,"No originality take a ride with the natural
I aint blow up yet
Fear the greatest bomb in the Apple
Tackles broke to pieces
The streets are scorching trying to over ease ya
A firm believer I wore the crown on my Caesar
Freezer count me up
This test an alley thump just made the tally jump
Wild around me catch a smiley cut let out the alley up
Writers block cant get my mind to stop
Most days I island hop
Karmas a bitch I found a spot
Wandering trips around the clock
Charming your chick from down the block
Flow got her she found a shark
My fins showin two tens throwing a pound a spark
Uh So many washing up Im edged in stone though
You fool pit browse
My testers slam the lomo exit solo
Big tests for soso need us extra promo
No runner ups can catch the pros
So slice the pie like Lexus logo
Bet my cadence alarms impostors
Problems just hanging strange fruit
Hs and orange boxes
Big faces in all the watches
Roses Aces and Knockers
Hoes embrace their show stoppers
Hundred papers more options
With hunger pain theres no nonsense
Rumble game Im all offense
Launching confidence here
And I know these powers wont feel me
Theyll be over your shit in no time
And no you aint getting no cosign
Im fully equipped to go
Im in solid gold at the goal line
Powder rope through my smoke climb higher
Cant pick my code ma
Over matter fact whos badder
Aint no rapper here or after
Back in my zone at night
These new niggas is over hyped
Steep look into a soldiers life
Three or four minutes of poltergeist
Sweet beginningsIm ultra nice
Come kill a God he multiples
Open eyes hit critics
Visits from broken wives
Through the impossible
The fuck is you doing with oxygen
These bums done brung up my name in vein
Wondering when you hit your compliments
My conscience vents
Henny and mobster tints
Hell out the audience
Stand up guy bet he wont hop a fence
If any a consequence
Stepped in good been stomping since
Different kind maybe common sense
Calm me down with the capital
Built the crown and no avenue
Boring niggas will challenge you
Slaughtering since 2002
Porno vids in my memory
Foreign trips out to Kennedy
Hoing tricks out for energy
Told a bitch I wouldnt let it be
Every week with another head
Chcheck out my symmetry
My maniac rhyme
More amazing than all your favorites combined
Im killing ya maaan
Hit the fire on these bitches one time
I sunshine I cook the area
Burn up your front line
Turn up my new shit product of DJ Dram
Sour out the nose and bottle cliques
Urban model chicks
Lifes a room a dollar should
Slide in a Ferragamo slip
Top of the metropolis
Looking down on your confidence
Hooking up with your confidant
Cooling feels like the comp is gone
Uh hoes in my sweaters
Hoes be over zealous
Hold it down dirty as hell
When we roll to town
Whats up with all these clowns
I gave you years how dare you doubt me
Even when I aint here you hear about me

She had big breasts honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dancefloor gettin our boogie on
I see the haters watchin me wit they hoodies on
Tryin to peep the ice under the sleeve
Im like Its time to breeze told honey Lets leave
Took her to MGs got some eggs and cheese
Grits fishcakes and orange juice freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal I said Whats the deal
For real you goin home or you tryna chill
She got close whispered somethin slow in my ear
And it aint hard to tell where we goin from here
Yeah
I aint on that hatin stuff
I was feelin shorty and the bitch told me she was datin Puff
Im a average nigga
And she said she was in a 6month relationship wit that nigga called Jigga
How Imma compete wit that Im a corner nigga sellin crack
Guess I gotta be a ball playin nigga to bone Da Brat
One bitch aint even wanna fuck
She runnin around all open off Kurupt
The hoe I thought was gon be real easy
Told me she got a man hes some beatmakin nigga named Stevie
Whats wrong wit these hoes Im a fly nigga
I dont wanna go flipmode on Rah Digga
Or Miss Lopez bitch know Feds
She used to be in The Bronx rockin PROKeds
Wit some Dominican dro heads
Ridin topless on the back of mopeds titties all out
What What What
If your game rusty around your dame never trust me
Cause soon as you blink Imma slide her off and bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of niggas I know are takin care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low Im freaky like that
I never get caught creepin cause Im sneaky like that uhh
It aint my fault your girl be hohoppin
And matter of fact the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
Its because of me why shes walkin crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait cause Im not on the patient tip
Just hit me off we dont need a relationship
And when you mention my name it ring a bell
Ask any female nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her wit this big brown anaconda

3365,"NBA Never Broke Again Lyrics
Bitch Im ballin bitch Im ballin racked up no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team I should join the league
NBA never broke again never going broke again
NBA never broke again never going broke again
Cause bitch Im ballin bitch Im ballin
I fuck her once dont call her
My niggas gettin that green we in a different league
NBA never broke again never going broke again
NBA never broke again never going broke again
Got so much money I got racks on racks on racks on racks on racks
Bitch so much money my shit stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks
You see me smokin and you know I got that pack I got that sack
I got that O I hit the club I lose control
I smoke that loud I know the grower
Ball like the owner
Hit this gin make things move slower
Im never sober
Roll some weed our eyes gets lower
Im in my old school
Ride it sound just like a newer motor
Theyre wondering how I get these mills and still live like a stoner
No other way I get a 100k from each promoter
Or more than that hold up
Money long it dont fold up
Let me get some gin pour up
Got some bomb weed roll up
Niggas got their gang thrown up
These niggas got their game they got it from us
Im with my gang and my niggas go nuts
You talkin money best believe I show up
And all the real niggas know us
Bitch Im ballin bitch Im ballin racked up no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team I should join the league
NBA never broke again never going broke again
NBA never broke again never going broke again
Cause bitch Im ballin bitch Im ballin
I fuck her once dont call her
My niggas gettin that green we in a different league
NBA never broke again never going broke again
NBA never broke again never going broke again
Talkin money but walkin funny
Is it any reason why yall starvin
I spell boredom by spelling foursome
Do I really need to beg your pardon
And my jersey say James I dont play games
Like Bron when he in that Garden
And wait I said that all wrong
She dont need to rock it when I put my hard in
My new nickname is just watch
Might not join might just watch
New yacht master just a watch

You know when I hold you you wont be alone
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if hes ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And hes older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But its old school its like 03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody elses past

If you dont know what then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mels IceTs and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause its hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And thats a track and if you want a eeeeeeeh 
You have to make it like that

I cant dig it at all because theres no tube
Fire when you speak but aint no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If its better with time then think in line
That youre going to be your nicest round your midlife crisis
If youre life like Christ live your midlife like its Christlike
Nigga I aint psychic
I know its all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous youre Lance with endorsements

Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school

2361,"Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
New York New York the city that never sleeps
Bodies covered in white sheets are layin in the streets
Shit gets deep as we creep up the block by the kids slangin rocks
And holdin Glocks stolen from the cops to get props
You gotta split a top on the regular
Or get plugged in your mug from a slug by your competitor
Gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder no wonder
Another brother six feet under
You know it aint no jokin when the streetlights are broken
So keep your eyes open or get ready for a smokin loc
Step out of line I hope you got your nine gun son
The Smith and Wess you better press 911 word up 
Or make a run for it theres too many to tackle
The Big Applell put your ass on ice like a Snapple
So even though I rap I gots to stay strapped
Niggas act up I back up PIYAH 
I bust a cap inside your fuckin hat
Dont even pose with them hoes the swinger that you chose
Just might be down with the foes only the shadow knows
And aint no lollipop lollipop over here only the shottie pops
BOOM Now just sit back and watch the bodies drop
The younger gunmen got the bigger niggas runnin
The shorties what the shorties what the shorties are comin
To push a nigga wig back and leave his ass flat on his back
The motherfuckin ghetto knows and its like that
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
Todays headlines another nigga dead
Six to the body and fo to the head
Followed the red bitch in the bed full of lead
A drugrelated case and now the place is filled with Feds
Ramshacked the shack disclouse bout two kilos of dope
Two ounces of cokes caught in the pocket of his coat
So another brother caught the ultimate surprise
With blown out brains to drop stains on his eyes
Dazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news
Watchin his family goin through all the boohoos
You lose like an Ill Street the Blues are gettin deeper
Nothin left in the room except for him the Grim Reaper
Police will take a few snapshots scoop up some blooddrops
Pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots
The cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street
So they just pull out the white sheets to cover up the dead meat
Seal off the area with yellow tape draw the white
Chalk around the body now the party has to motivate
One more outlaw was murdered on the scene for the green
Died at the age of seventeen
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
Strollin the concrete packin my heat walkin the backstreets
I seen niggas pull up peepin me out the side a black Jeep
Six feet deep thats where Im goin if Im slippin
Steady cockin my shit cause I already got the clip in
Now whos the first nigga to run up here they come up
The block hardrocks with Glocks rollin holdin they guns up
I buck I buck and then I struck one in the chest
Nigga shoulda wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest
But now I got three mo niggas pullin triggers
Strays are ricochetin off the bricks zigga zigga
But who got the biggest strap Whos bustin bigger caps
My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS
No haps G Rap aint goin out like a sucker
I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker
Quick I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin at me
Cause I wont be too happy with a slug inside my nappy
Two more niggas left they scared to death but Im leary
Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me
I went between two cars lettin off the quarter pound
I see another body fallin down to the ground
Quick I run up on him cause I dont think that hes dead
Standin over his ass I put two more inside his head
Thats three niggas down only got one nigga to go
I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so
I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up
Nearly shot my whole clip up I got one more slug to rip up
Look over by the GS see his ass stickin his head out
Boom let the lead out blew a piece of his brain dead out
The back of his head now hes dead because he fell face down
Right on the motherfuckin streets that he dwelled
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go

971,"Brothers and sisters and friends and I see some enemies
Laughter and then applause
In fact I think wed be fooling ourselves
If we had an audience this large and didnt realize
That there were some enemies present
Im a weapon that fires lyrical projectiles
With no mercy Im coldblooded like reptiles
Touch a pregnant bitch and make her give birth to a dead child
Every time I flex styles
Niggas vacate the premises and become exiles
I manufacture rhymes like textiles of xfiles
Enlighten juveniles livin life with no purpose
Organize an army that will make the devils nervous
Competition is worthless like the electoral vote
If you provoke Ill break your motherfuckin neck in a yoke
Your better off throwin your shitty life away sniffin coke
Technique will choke you into a spiritual state
And it will take a lake of hydrochloric acid to soften this
Ill fake your parents suicide and kill you in the orphanage
But I inspire ideological metamorphosis
Stop talkin shit or Ill make your existence a memory
So you can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
But Ill break the ice if anyone on the planet mentions me
Ill burn a hypocritical flag intentionally
Explosive revolutionary chemistrys my destiny
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
When I fight you I wont snipe you
Ill use a HIVinfected needle to strike you
As well as anyone that vaguely resembles or looks like you
And just to spite you Ill force your children
At gun point to bite you and rip a piece off
To start the beef off of the rest of your petty limited life
Im comin atcha to catch ya by surprise in the cyph
Nobodys stupid enough to back ya when I tactically attack ya
Because my style is nasty like protruding bone fractures
And youre a playedout dirty pussy devil like Margaret Thatcher but Technique never get captured inside the rapture
Cause I mastered the art of causin natural disasters
You should learn the difference
In between the students and the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damagin decibels
Even though my starvin people are considered expendable
I consecutively escape the racist corporate tentacles
I spit raw kinetic energy thats immeasurable
Retaliation for perpetration is unendable
Mercy is not extendible
Ill break your fuckin brain down into psychological chemicals
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy

Bring on the moes and hoes
Dont snooze or doze cause Im rippin up shows
Hold your nose dead bodies are around
I leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown
I write rhymes that shine like lipstick
So much material but not materialistic
Imperial styles I use
When the mic is lifted the crowd is amused
Come with it if you feel youre fullfledged
Or yell Geronimo and jump off the edge
Your END is near when I appear
The stage is yours but wait until the smoke clears
Rhyme sayer and Im here to lay a load
So watch a player when hes playin in player mode

And I be demandin that youre abandoned
In the desert or a wild west town
While Im at your crib on a cherrygoround
Where will she stop No one knows
Like I said before bring on the moes and hoes
I know my ABCs and my Ps and Qs
Just chill and listen to the rhyme cruise
All aboard the cord theres a reward
Some were ignored when they toured for the bored
The crowd wasnt loud lyrics werent endowed

Its so visual the way Im throwin down
Visualize MCs goin down
In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes
The moral of the story is Ima get mines
I saw the cordless boy Im gonna house that
Your rhymes are cheesy you found em in a mouse trap
Dont try to front while the freestyles droppin
He wants to battle he must be needlepoppin
You better notify your next of kin
Cause when I begin its like a needle to the skin
If you wasnt prepared then you ought to be scared
But even if you was youre aware what the rhyme does
I remember when you was an amateur
Writin your rhymes starin at my signature
Bought the album analyzed the style
Tsktsk Achoo God bless you child
Im unique when I speak to a beat
Another rapperll fall when the missions complete
I daze and amaze my displays a faze
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays
The competition thats lost in a freestyle

2160,"Wanted On the Run LyricsRunning Breathing
Wanted 100 miles and runnin
Through the rain and the sun when them fed folks comin
Keep your head up youngin gotta keep ya heads up youngin
The streetsll give your head up youngin
Listen clip your contacts stay focused like contacts
Your heads open for a contract
Cant go where mom at the last place you wanna bring the dram at
The first place they gonna track I promise
Cant relax but remain the calmest
Couple rules that your play by stay by stay live
You keep your boots on your laces tight
And only troop on the late night if you play right you stay right right
You never play the day light jakes get on your tail
Never let them see the break lights
Catch me if you can when Im dippin from the cops
Mr Gingerbread never falling victim of the fox
Chorus Wanted Dead or Alive 2x 
Wanted but you cant stop runnin
With a price on your head be prepared to gunnin
Dont be scared like the Red Coats comin nigga
Stay underground and keep runnin like Tubman
You cant sleep not a peep no slumber
Man I sleeped about a 100 hours rest this summer
No stress when your dealin with the run in
Waking up in cold sweats pissed scared of the rumblin
Fuck it just prepare for the trouble
Dont be shit scared nigga with your head undercovers
This not a broad threat I got something for em
On the steps with two tecs this is not a warnin
Nigga they close like camera flash
When the hammer blast put on your State Prop camouflage
Crack the box or the avalanche put on your Montana mask
Get to clappin like its Pakistan
What every strap cause an accident
Make a traffic jam dodge all the traps you can keep runnin
Chorus Wanted Dead or Alive 2x 
All you got to say is hide me I ride free
I be the one to change your birth SS or ID I got all that 
Aint no more hangin with the YG State Prop
No Roc private doc case you need an IV
No more Bent thats Accord money 420
Schemes cant afford money money yous award money
Whether 90 or the first degree any murder in the first degree
Well be the third degree and they looking for the perjury
If you aint murk the G perfectly youll be in surgery
Take the seed out the nursery nurse him at the precinct
Give em dessert that aint where he deserve to be
And I went through this personally certainly
32 for burglary now it was referred to me
So they play us in no way know way
Blaze up the roadways AC and OJ
Read the paper eggs and OJ
Call CD the head of the OJays
Thats a gipsy caps risky all the chips we had
45 fleeflicker we niggas hit the gas
When the operation go stale aint no jail
I did my whole album on bail Thats the truth 
I got you Mac Mittens I send them a black ribbon
Attached to Mac spittin I cant go back prison

Oakland
Oakland California
Oakland california is the city of snakes
Pimps pussies players and fakes
Loud mouth bitches who talk too much
Dick teasin bitches who never fuck
Sucka ass nigga fake as hell
A man or a bitch I really cant tell
Some of you niggas need to quit
Show and tell nigga you aint shit
Sayin I got this and I got that
But when it comes to you I got no rap
Cause what I see is good for me
And what I dont know just let it be
Bitches gamin workin extensions
Her hair aint really but two inches
Bald head girls in the Oakland world
Short afros and jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald head and say go to hell
But your a snake your a worm
Bald head bitch you need a perm
Oakland california is the city of liars
Fresh barbed wires with vouge tires
Niggas tellin stories twenty minutes long
And everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I dont wanna know
All I want is stereo rock
Homeboys kick it gettin keyed
Sold that mark some fake weed
Told that nigga here you go
A big fat sack and you know its premo
A 20dollar bill went to your hand
You rushed that money to the coke man
To the coke bottle was the next stop
But you broke the bottle and cant smoke rock
Base rocks base rocks thats your daddy
You better off smokin on a powdered cabby
Have a white christmas everyday
Cause cocaine cabby is a too short way
Thats Too SHORT
Smoke more coke than Richard P
Have more money than Michael Jackson
Oakland can I get some action
Hey young tender in the 501s
I love to see when you work your tongue
Suckin my dick in the back of the car
Rollin down Skyline boulavard
I said beeeeeeeyach
What are you smoking
A big fat dick in the big East Oakland
I see my homie he needs to quit
Holdin hands with a bitch who looks like shit
Maybe Im wrong by what I say
Maybe that nigga is gettin paid
Maybe that nigga aint bein used
Gettin fucked without collectin dues
Thats how I work all the time
Im Too Short baby got a fresh new rhyme
For Oakland California thats the place
Homies got drugs all in yo face
When the OPD cruise down again
Niggas goin half off dubes and tens
On any corner anywhere
Buy your drugs from a Oakland player
Niggas sell squat callin it top
Cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
Crime went down murder went up
And some of these turfs are tryin to get tuff
Whos the leader of the hour
Anybody livin if they push power
M16 357
Sendin these niggas to hell not heaven
So much death in the Oakland streets
Your nothin but a target sellin weed
You know Im rappin the honest truth
Niggas roll up shootin guns at you
Threatening your life and calling you fake
Till you take your drugs to another state
And sometimes man its a pity
Cause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city
Niggas who take do you know yourself
You must be the nigga with all the wealth
Maybe one day you can own this town
If everybody fucked and you are down
Thats how you see it I do too
But I break bitches and you break crews
Oakland California is gettin tough
Niggas got schemes for coming up
Niggas got ways to make big bank
Hittin these streets like an army tank
Im Too SHORT
Spitin more game than youll ever speak
music for 10 seconds 
I got more bitches wantin me
Cause Im the best dam rapper from the Oakland streets
Im the coldest MC on a microphone
Oakland California wont leave it alone
Cause Im on this mic rapping that game
Knockin off tapes like Im selling cocaine
Fucking these freaks indefinitely
I never stop fucking you Oakland freaks
High school bitches really like
The way Sir Too Short can rock the mic
Oakland California thats the place
Freak freak bitch got a lot of ways
She got big fat titties size 38
Imma fuck that bitch but I cant wait
The young girl makes my body boil
When I fuck that bitch imma drill for oil
Imma put cocaine all over my dick
And tell that bitch its time to lick
East Oakland thats where I live
The city of the freak freak freaky bitch
I spent the night with her she aint mine
I fuck that bitch so many times
And that right there I could never fake
I thought my goddamn dick would break
Fucking too much makes you hurt
But I never stuck a bitch from puttin in work
All you bitches can suck me dry
Suckin my dick for the rest of your lives
Ok baby here we are
Were just two young freaks in the back of the car
You are one whos the other
Its Sir Too Short that rappin ass brotha
Everytime I talk to you
Whatcha wanna know is it still cool
And everytime what do I state
Your still my bitch thats everyday
All you bitches cause Im a hall
And you baby girl my freaky doll
Im too short baby now Im smokin
Another big cabby and Im in East Oakland
Not the west not the north
Its the eastside baby Im Sir Too Short
I can spit a rap and ill create
A sucker MC everyday
Niggas from Oakland young and old
Runnin round here keep off that dope
Singin my rap at the skating rink
Sucker MC do you know what I think
You wanna be me so damn bad
You wish that you could make my raps
When I say Short you say your name
Tellin your homies you rappin game
But I sell tapes and niggas know
You singin my rap in stereo
Some of you niggas aint really shit
And Tony G is just a bitch
Why does Tony rap like me
Cause he aint no pass high 
Just sleep to the world on what I do
Grab a mic front you
Tony G you just cant have it
Nothin but a little lightskinned old faggot
Tryin to rap on the mic
But Too Short baby is what they like

2193,"I really thought we couldve worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldnt stop playing around
Didnt understand but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
Its a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad baby
So sad
Look at all that we couldve had
Just too bad
Yo baby
Let me rescue you from the residue
I dont know what the restll do
But this is what the bestll do
Take you to a better view
Do things we never do
Pleasure you treasure you
Dont skimp and measure you girl
And they scrutinize cause you get the coupe to drive
But you caught me cheating and in stupid lies
Yeah we argued a little no need to pout mama
I changed I aint about drama Scouts honor
And you forgave me thats why I behaved b
You dont have to bathe me to love that you gave me its gravy
Grade me would I get a A B
Maybe you my lady but you my baby

Wish you aint acknowledge me Wish I aint acknowledge ya
Acting like drugs if I do I would have bottled ya
Bitter on Twitter following my followers
And I dont like a follower uh
I heard enough complaining
You getting chilly Imma let it burn Usher Raymond
Thats where game was served let me explain my words
You like a app in my iPhone a angry bird
Screaming Cam name cause I do the damn thing
Forget a low down dirty its a damn shame
Cause you a thug cutie Louis snug booty
Oohwee but the attitude on Judge Judy
I really thought we couldve worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt

49,"Its the number one crew in the area
The Big L be lightin niggas like incense gettin men lynched
Too intense Im killin infants for ten cents
Cause Im a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that dont even speak English
Im makin ducks shed much tears I buck queers
I dont have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares
Im grabbin brews takin fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitchass niggas
After you your manll get scarred next
And if your squad flex Im lettin off like Bernard Goetz
A TEC9 is my utensil
Fillin niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
Im known for snatchin purses and bombin churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin with more keys than a janitor
Now its the dictator whose styles greater
Its the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin Now Laters
And rappers I hit em well
They automatically go to Heaven fuckin with me cause I give em Hell
So dont try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
Im out to collect figures
Im on some WuTang shit so protect your fuckin neck nigga
Not a role model Im a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all you new jacks kickin wack raps
Its a fact that Ill be on your fuckin back like a knapsack
It aint shit you can tell me
Because bitches still jel me without a motherfuckin LP
Its the number one crew in the area
Known for sendin garbage MCs to the graveyard
Its the number one crew in the area
Known for sendin garbage MCs to the graveyard
Yo I got a death wish
Thats why I talk so much fuckin shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let em smoke the fourfifth
Ah fool Ah goodbye No need to try to lie or cry
Its time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards Id be missin a whole deck
Strap up a MAC clack clack
Motherfuckers are runnin like rats
The blind bats are fuckin crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nuts loose
And youre wonderin how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25tolife bids
For murderin up some fuckin white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin killin squads of prison guards in the prison yard
Onetwo everybodys through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now Im back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So Im the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin stun gun
The way I rock no way you could stop
I stop pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When Im in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for pppound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin A Fuckin Jay Ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
Im never chokin off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screamin like Onyx
Respect that Ill peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothin but a rep
Im givin these ladies somethin they can feel cause Im real
Ya man get outta line and its kill kill kill kill
Yo you step up and youll get played like the small fry
Im throwin niggas off the roof since you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around youll be a dead man
I get hype Tonights Da Night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself cause I aint workin with a full deck
Im lethal eatin people
Not Jeffrey Dahmer Im the sequel head or gut like Illegal
So whatcha want
Yo Im strapped with the gats
Step up plap plap
Im leavin caps in your back fool
I rip shop wanna say peace to HipHop
A nigga disagree Bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck Im Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how Im gettin jewels
I tell em big up big up Its a stick up stick up

And thats how we do
So IU grab the gat and let loose
Yo rattattat I got the gat cocked
Nigga we ghost man a punk

One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin grand larceny

Supreme supreme
supreme lyricism 
You aint an MC you just a mocker a one
Chakra unopen
Stop it youre dumb
Popping your gums
Quannum dropping ya bums
Topple rocking watching ya crumble
Dropping your young
Logic cannot get caught with the stun
And talk that I brought that are hotter than tropical suns
Optical shots to the opposition and hospitals come
Melodic hypnotic apocalyptic pox get ya sprung
Atomic more chronic than chronic
Mixed with vodka and rum
Anonymous logic beyond youre lifting oxygen from
The toxic thoughts of a lot of nonsense
And popping of guns
Your ark and youre done
Your knowledge is preposterous son
With posture and form
Im monstrous youre lost in a storm
Youre docile and your confidence
Is why my offense is strong
Monotonous get out my office
Im your obstacle run
Im dropping your pawns
Im like a hippopotamus gone
Off of his rocket guarding
All his kids his pops and his moms
Im op an old army call the doctor sound the alarm
Its not the opera
Its your pop in top and optimum form
And partner Im the cop
Youre not about to stop with a gun
A copper a ton

Interesting lines
Thatll send the shift within your spine
Sent to get my grind crackin
When its pen and pencil time
Bent to get your dime askin
If the Gift could spend some time
With her my mind enter
Hither hints Im in a distant
Reminisce on rhythmless
Again from discipline I find
Instant mental shrines
Opening the great abyss of rhyme
Planets just align
If you slip you get your shit got by
Its horrific fly
Mystic twisted wordprolific guy
Just a bit of my
Swift and vicious wrist to get your eye
Lifted just a bit wider
Split the wit lyrical writer
Intimate with this style
Lyrics is just shittin fire
Ignorance exists
End it with a twist of this rhyme
Sent to get yall niggas lit
And bring ya to the sky

You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do Id practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you black out and collapse I want to help you to come to
Notice I havent yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
Youre everything send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet musicll start I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart we gotta work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list what I want not what I need theres a difference
These days Im learnin that words got power so Ima be specific
Word

457,"Its hot like Hell in the south
It feel like we in the devil mouth in the south
So white boys tripping cause we iced out
Cool as a cucumber hopping out
A 73 Impala with the brains blowed out
Let the robbers follow
Swear to God fuck nigga get your brain blowed out
Your baby momma followed or your man shot down
Im from Martin Luther King respect it its holy ground
Whod have thought a nigga out a shotgun house
Would ever drive a car with a angel that bow
Im the shit cause I come from the bowels
The guts of the city aint a nigga fucking with me
Young player from the South tell stories like Biggie
Take the Kings English paint pictures so vivid
That the listener will swear to God they lived it
If that aint God in motion nigga tell me what is it
The church ladies weep when they hear your man speak
They say they see God in me but Im in the streets
They ask me why Im rapping tell me Im called to preach
I smile I kiss em on they honey brown cheeks
I tell em God bless em and they concern for me
But you can never walk on water if you still fear the sea
If Jesus came back Mother where you think hed be
Probably in these streets with me
Peace
Came out the valley of the shadow of death
Judas still got the knife in my back
Devils trying to give a G life for crack
Haters mad cause I baptized my laugh
Keep a Jesus piece to protect myself
If heaven got a ghetto you can bet Ill be there
God is with me
God is in me
God is in me
To get to Heaven I will raise Hell
But before I be a servant in white heaven I will rule in a black hell
See the leader jumping out a black SL
On the block like Yes yeah the truth here
Living reckless for a necklace and big chain
The wages of sin is death not the chain gang
Touch my chain I bang bang bang
Leader of the Grind Time Rap Gang mang
We a squadron of Gods marksmen
Greek heroes we the new Titans
Young Achilles nigga I will kill these niggas
No homo I just dont feel these niggas
Laid back seeing panoramic views
Its a angelic view the sky so blue
Similar to my diamonds and they hue
I pray my success is a torment to you
God MC boy ex dboy
Only thing real in a room full of decoys
Angel wings got a nigga flying higher
I hope my success burn you like hellfire
I hope seeing me whip cars dressed fresh
Torments your ass like a man possessed
Be blessed
Amen

Black Thought quit playin him close and back up off him
Kweli spruce to the tree Bruce to the Lee

A flea could move a tree before you think youre movin me
I black and blue emcees actin new to me get smacked stupidly
They lack skills like the Black community lack unity Uh 
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz
Step off the stage to shouts of Kweli boomaiyay
See these four emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game change your whole sound
Nigga you gotta understand the plot to

Is you a dedicated soldier or you a princess dog
Im in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf Ha 
Nann nigga competition gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission hittin Pharoahe for help
From natives walkin the Trail of Tears to players sippin Belvedere
We always comin wellprepared and all my dogs smellin fear

Truth or consequences and all senses be wellaware Woo 
Your style underdeveloped there hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see but I can tell by your stare
Nigga you fugazi sayin ya crew blazin
Like sayin Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican Cmon 
Guerrilla Monsoon rap smell the fumes get in tune with it
When I attack your city yall gon think Dr Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seedspittin contests
With a vendetta that send a better letter bomb to Congress
Im pissed cumulus clouds are ominous
Words of the four the rawness thatll restore your calmness
Unless you wanna leave leg and armless
Thats parapaleg for those who believe in bomb threats

1157,"Canibus
Throwing melanated molotov cocktails
Engineer directly out of Full Sail
Ripping the jacker aint nobody nastier
Spitting and grabbing facts and data to enhance ya
Canibus the lyrical adjective killer
My Melatonin Magik is enhanced by the melatonin tablets
Come take a walk with Canibus
Ardipithecus Ramidus what the fuck is Melatonin Magik Bis
I still aint understanding this shit
Okay my brain is a microchip
My two balls with a cane is a macrodick I rap so sick
I created swine ploo out of an infinite mix
You tried to diss but cant even spit you just stand there and wish
With your hand on your hips man you a bitch
Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king
You see thats my problem I spit a thousand bars yall was silent
I aint heard nothing about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
And then I realized cant nobody even fuck with my rhymes
The Internet is an early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent
But children dont understand the concept of consequence
So yes its immature to express disrespect
But no I will not accept what the media says
They are the reason we are being misled
There are forces above them that feed off our stress suffering and debt
I am Dead by Design cause nobody tells me what to rhyme
I make up my own fucking mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men
Thirteen levels above 33 let me say it again
They are gods and we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine their power
They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours
You tryna to plan a great escape Youre a coward
They gon march into a gas chamber make us think were taking a shower
Mommas and babies is crying
The children of Zion belong to Skynet nobody knows whos behind it
So if you dont care fine then I dont care either
But I aint spineless like you Im a true believer
In the metaphysical aether you listening to the lyrical reaper
The spiritual teacher empirical speaker
After this album they gon call me a leader
But Im not Killuminati just gon murder me like Pac
Blood sacrifice or not I dont even wanna be alive
If its like that then fuck Tiamaat
You can laugh at my appearance
Well fuck you for standing there staring fuck everything on this planet
Including the evil spirits notwithstanding the aliens
Acting like they dont hear us theres no need to fear us
Just come done and help us I love James Brown more than I love Elvis
But that dont mean Im selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
Crispy crunchy black crawling out of Hells pit
You scream for hardcore I felt it
But what you gon do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit
You wont do a motherfucking thing
Cause let me tell you why you a coward and you dont know shit
Cause if my Brothers stand next to me the energy expands collectively
The world was never ready for me
And they aint ready for their own freedom neither they perish from the heater
The fire breathers crawl out of their cage to eat em
Like thin crust pizza Cthulhu creatures with rough features
Jeepers creepers good luck with Jesus
How many meters Reload and squeeze it
I run up in the Vatican with demons just to get even
Thats where the biggest demon is
Its no secret but nobody else sees it so they wont believe it
But thats when I calm back down the key word is back down
I got possessed by my own raps wow
Knock knock whos home The black Dan Brown
I didnt mean what I said please dont kill me now
My ghostwriters not around plus it was just a freestyle
But at least I got better beats now
Meanwhile motherfuckers still mad I feel bad
Id apologize but you acting like a real fag
What the fuck Im supposed to feel like
Twelve years later I still dont get acknowledged for shit that I write
But I dont want to talk to you now
Itd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around
They still ask me about Second Round even now
Interviewers voice Canibus can you tell us of what happened again Look at this fucking clown
Cant get over it they ask me a loaded question
And act like I was the one promoting it hang up on em
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Stupid surrogate twelve years later Im on some other shit
And so is the whole world look at the mother ships
And so is the whole world look at the mother ships
After this album they gon call me a leader but Im not
The Illuminati just gon murder me like they did Pac
Blood sacrifice or not
Its Professor Griff the exminister

2252,"Ready or not
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell word 
Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally thats confusion to a youngn tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say thats where you go when you die
But how they know
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons it was a blessing not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and thats where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
Thats why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that aint vein to me
Its just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin to go inside
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup 
Living in mass confusion looking for absolution
The gas seducin and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
Momma say its her after me
Preacher say its blasphemy
I say theres gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God heres you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean
We know hey 
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
Hell its all going to 
Hell its all going to 
Hell yup we living in 
Hell yup they giving us 
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
Its bad here on Earth but if we dont get to heaven
Its hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd dont mean I gotta be no sheep
You feel me
More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history

3234,"This is Lyte and Im just here to say
That I choose to express my feelings this way
Always alone either with a microphone
Or just plainly emphasize the tone
Of my voice cause yo I know Im your choice
So when I am speaking show your gratitude
While I am teaching I have no attitude
Im just here to get the job totally done
85 work 15 fun
Sometimes I admit I get so excited
Rhyme for rhyme I just cant fight it
Cant stop the flow its just too persistant
Big girls dont cry
Big girls dont cry
Cant stop the flow its just too persistant
The level is extremely low on my resistance
By you or any other Ill never be beaten at a
Rap meeting in other words a battle
Cause yall Im like a farmer and yalls the cattle
Be a big girl about it dont you start cryin
Thatll mean I made you weep without even tryin
Lyte takes it like a big girl Im no jive girl
Comin direct tellin you that Im a live girl
Im positive youve heard this expression before
So next time you see Lyte shine through the door
Dont talk behind my back confront me like a big girl
Big girls dont cry
Big girls dont cry
Dont talk behind my back confront me like a big girl
So I can take you to all slimmies of the world
Big girls we dont fight over men
Although theres one worth fighting for every now and then
But then I think again its not worth my while
And its also not a big girl style

So I kept guns in my palm like Mesiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed up oldhead
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then
One of them nosey neighbors done snitched on us Again 
Hey this game juicy got me puffing looseys
Every two days interigated by the police
See this life I live cost more than your Roleys money
It cost my homie Nook his whole life ya heard me
When he was here it was easy to love him like a brother
Now thats hes gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean What do you say to a woman
Thats just lost her only son to the game and the gun except mami
Ima ride for him
The look that she gave me Like Sparks you got some nerve
Cause most of these niggas dont keep their words
Now Im under pressure
And I cant even break that type of promise
And yall niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him

I lace your grill with the firestarter
Hit your wife with the sawed off
In the shower powerdrive ya daughter
Im all about the fundamentals like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mentals compatible with the radicals
My odyssey type qualities allow me to poli with animals
Niggas is cannibals and the ghettos the jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles
Or struggle or live civil and humble
My niggasll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran
Try to imagine what they can fathom for twenty grand
Niggasll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
We pound out weak shit into the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down just wilding in jean
Pile on the green surrounded in green like flowers in Spring

And if I get murdered Dont Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka bury me next to my father
In three days Ill rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open in my hands I got the Gatling
Im looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury you wouldnt like me when Im angry
I turn Mr Rogers Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This aint Pictionary all you see is the cemetery
Bodies from World War I and II is there
You dont want a third war thats nuclear warfare
So Big Pun count the stacks make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we running a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and wack rap is packed in your backpack
Youre better off in DC with the mayor smoking crack

Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess

Lured from the fakest material things disguised as wealth
Thinkin Im vulnerable Im not weapon concealed behind the belt

Just when you thought you finally clipped my wings you were helpin me fly
Maybe my dark auras reversed maybe I fell from the sky
Cant let no playbothsiders blot out my vision eyeforaneye
They want the truth intact force me to shoot it back left me a boobytrap
How cruel is that Got me out in the corners where it get spooky at

Half of what you may see common sense is rare and you losin that

1714,"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rmy
I didnt mind it when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to pass me bricks credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him Ill be back go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin gettin numbers in the summer ho hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homie Jimmy hes screamin Gimme
Lay me on my back bustin nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked I think I bust twice
He was nice kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels kept me out nice
Called suckin his dick rockin the mic
It was somethin about this dude I couldnt stand
Somethin that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin I wanted but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy
I dont want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh uh uh uh Lil Kim Lil Kim bring it to me now
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush Avenue U
Had a weed spot used to pump African black
He used to seal his bag so his workers wouldnt tap
I used to see him in The Tunnel with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him so I fucked him it wasnt nuttin
He wanted me to suck him but I didnt I aint frontin
The sex was wack a fourstroke creep
I jumped on the dick rode his ass to sleep
He called next week askin why I aint beep him
I thought your ass was still sleepin
He laughed told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass
Ill pass nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein me is if you eatin me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 Gs nigga if ya leave me alone screamin
I dont want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I dont want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
The moral of the story is this
You aint lickin this you aint stickin this
And I got witnesses ask any nigga I been with
They aint hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I aint with that frontin shit
I got my own Benz I got my own ends immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds some big niggas
Fuck for car keys and doubledigit figures
Good dick I cherish I could be blunt

For limpdick niggas thats frontin like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me you feel me

Whats the date and time it dont matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homies Impala
She said whats up yeah whats the deal

She said Yeah remember that date
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said Damn are you sure its mine
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times
She said That day no I wasnt whoring
Your ass is mine thats when the sweat started pouring
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy

See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
Cause yo ho I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and Im knowing

Im gettin fed up bitch
Cause I know youre tryin to break me
But if I find out your tryin to fake me
Im a buff that duff and hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my nextdoor neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But lets check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative
Damn why did I let her live
After that I shouldve got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the ho who laid me
Excuse me bitch its a switch
You cant fade me
Naw baby not this way
Yo you aint playing Ice Cube out like no booger

We got this ho muthafucka on a mission
Now the whole entire worlds gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they calling on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip Spice1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap aint done shit for that
Ive even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you trying kick some dust up
Americas been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuckups
And we were always considered evil
Now they trying to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus Devin The Dude
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
So now they trying separation
And sending black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tapping into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So Davids got a silver mag
While listening to Brad David gets pissed and kills his dad
David Dukes got a shotgun
So why you get upset cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you dont dig me than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be saying aint worse than no western movie
Dont blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus Devin The Dude
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
You best to free your mind
Before I free my nine
And stop fucking with Dvoidofpop
Or feel my hot rocks
Bangbang boom boom ping ping Im the black
White boys got a magazine and dont kow how to act
Ill attack and make you vomit
Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad
Do he got a brother Im it now
Im the illest
Wanna kill this house nigga Don Cornelius
Can you feel this
You punk niggas make me sick
Sucking on the devils dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start douching
Houston is the place
I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut
Do the Reverend Calvin Butts
Got a pair of nuts
I started this gangsta shit in 86
Now you dissing me
For publicity
Isnt he a ho to the third degree
Who me
Im a g who like to scrapalot
Down with RapALot
And I cant stop wont stop
So fuck Bill and Hillary
Ice Cube there aint no killing me

Dropping on these selling out niggas doing it like this
Chorus Devin The Dude

Aint no puff and pass please roll your own I do the same
Girl get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryna pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame thats why youre not used to this game
And if you lookin for me Ill be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landin gear cause I dont need no runway
My final destination is a cloud its a oneway
Fuckin with them streets aint no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I dont never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets never on no sober shit
Posttraumatic stress I feel like thats what Im copin with
So I smoke the best impossible not to notice this
30000 feet up I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time aint even over yet
Im tryna live my life so when its over I got no regrets
The keys to success multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it til its over with
Napa Valley Dolce my cup runneth over with
My trunk is in my roof ayy you know who you rollin with
Hussle
I know a place we can go where you can be yourself
You aint gotta worry and we aint gotta rush cause we not in no hurry
You cant be afraid to let go you gotta let go of yourself
But you aint gotta worry cause this gon take some time
But we not in no hurry
58000
