825,"Back in NYC Lyrics
I see faces and traces of home
Back in New York City huh
So you think Im a tough kid
Is that what you heard
Yeah well I like to see some action
And it gets into my blood
They call me the trail blazer
Rael electric razor
Im the pitcher in a chain gang
We dont believe in pain
Cause were only as strong
Yes were only as strong
As the weakest link in the chain
Let me out of Pontiac
When I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me
If you know what I mean what I mean
Aaaah You say I must be crazy
Cause I dont care who I hit who I hit
But I know its me thats hitting out
And Im Im not full of shit
I dont care who I hurt
I dont care who I do wrong
This is your mess Im stuck in
I really dont belong
When I take out my bottle
Filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where Rael has been has been
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hair
Time to shave shave it off it off
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape No 
Off we go
Off we go
Off we go
Off we go
Youre sitting in your comfort
You dont believe Im real
You cannot buy protection
From the way that I feel
Your progressive hypocrites
Hand out their trash
But it was mine in the first place
So Ill burn it to ash
And Ive tasted all the strongest meats
And laid them down in coloured sheets
Laid them down in coloured sheets
Who needs illusion of love and affection
When youre out walking in the streets
With your mainline connection connection
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hair
Time to shave shave it off it off
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape

971,"Its a godawful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling No
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And shes hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For shes lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go
Its the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if hell ever know
Hes in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars
Its on Americas tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Cause Lennons on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother my dog and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
Its about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go

Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy

I got a song filled with shit for the strongwilled

Why the fuck not you only get one shot
Ate shit til I cant taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons Im bonded to
Cause theyre chasin me but Im part of you
So escapin me is impossible
I latch onto you like aparasite

And your childhood too

1601,"High or low whered you go
Are you stuck in the middle
A spectral invisible ghost
Im hereâjuxtaposed
Likeâimages of angelsâin the snow
Our courage melts awayâit comes then goes
Where you been Cannot find
A glimpse of my friend
Dont know where or when one of us left
The other behind
Divisions came and troubles multiplied
Incisions made by scalpel blades of time
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
Can I say how ya been
I can guess and conjecture
My altered perceptions unclear
Please interfere
Sadness comes with it a sea of tears
Would some love be best had it not appeared
Is this you Here I stand
Intense recollections of pain selfneglecting again
Like you I keep it in
Thought you found a game where you could win
Yeah its all vivisection in the end

She fell off the altar
A vision you caught her but then
A woodcut in red
I wish it was not you that she had led
Selfish navigation with no end
Whered you sleep Can I find
A deeper connection
In the face of rejection Im trying
Im trying
Evidence in the echoes of your mind
Leads me to believe we missed the signs
Can I try one last time
Could all use a savior from human behavior sometimes
And the kids are alright
The Queen of Collections took your time

Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make fortysome dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped outta school
Having fun I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See I cant put down the pipe
And it is breaking me down watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down is anybody out there
It is breaking me down no more friends around
And my dreams fall down is anybody out there
Can anybody out there hear me
Cause I cant seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me
Cause I cant seem to see myself
Theres gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell
Can anybody out there feel me
Cause I cant seem to feel myself

Can you help me find my way

I woulda done anything for my own
But I couldnt get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is Ill probably never know
The color of my daughters eyes
And it is breaking me down watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down is anybody out there
It is breaking me down no more friends around

Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived

Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind
Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction

New life born from the oppressed
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall

Turning off my sanity reaching back into my mind
Nonrising body from the grave showing new reality

2110,"Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket
And a head full of dreams
He said Somehow someway
Its gotta get better than this
Patti packed her bags
Left a note for her mama
She was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye
They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited
We got just one shot of life
Lets take it while were still not afraid
Because life is so brief
And time is a thief when youre undecided
And like a fistful of sand
It can slip right through your hands

Niggas Wit Attitudes
Niggas Wit Attitudes
Im comin straight outta Compton
When somethin happens in South Central Los Angeles
Nothin happens Its just another nigga dead dead 
Straight outta Compton crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When Im called off I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass thats how Im goin out
For the punk motherfuckers thats showin out
Niggas start to mumble they wanna rumble
Mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat thats pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Aint no tellin when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep you dancin
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK47 is the tool
Dont make me act the motherfuckin fool
Me you can go toe to toe no maybe
Im knockin niggas out the box daily
Yo weekly monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That Im down with the capital CPT
Boy you cant fuck with me
So when Im in your neighbourhood you better duck
Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave believe Im stompin
But when I come back boy Im comin straight outta Compton
Yall aoh aoh
City of Compton
City of Compton
Yo Ren
Whats up
Tell them where you from
Straight outta Compton another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke yo my rep gets bigger
Im a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggas wont show this
But I dont give a fuck Ima make my snaps
If not from the records from jackin the crops
Just like burglary the definition is jackin
And when Im illegally armed its called packin
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy I go up in it
So if youre at a show in the front row
Ima call you a bitch or dirtyass ho
Youll probably get mad like them bitches are posed to
But that shows me slut youre composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit cause Im tearin up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and thats a law
REN spells Ren but Im raw
See cause Im the motherfuckin Villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killin
Thats takin place without a clue
And once youre on the scope your ass is through
Look you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip
Straight outta Compton
City of Compton
City of Compton
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton is a brother thatll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont give a fuck thats the problem
I see a motherfuckin cop I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see a punk pass I smile
To me its kind of funny the attitudes showin a nigga drivin
But dont know where the fuck he goin just rollin
Lookin for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload you see its about to over the hesitation
And hears the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and Im jettin
But leave a memory no onell be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot Fuck her
You think I give a damn about a bitch I aint a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E and if you ever fuck with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
Word to the motherfucker straight outta Compton

1196,"As I awoke this evening
With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I cant believe I said
I cant believe our Warlords dead
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers guns
Oh great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
Ive read the writing of the smoke
And breastfed on the sound of drums
Ive learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftains daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red mans race be slowly crushed
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears
I take only what is mine Lord
My pony my squaw and my child
I cant stay to see you die
Along with my tribes pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run
Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
Hed been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead
Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I cant find a home
Its lonely and its quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think its time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon Ill find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole
",die Along with my tribes pride I go to search for the yellow moon And the fathers of our sons Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold And the healing waters run Trampling down the prairie rose Leaving hoof tracks in the sand Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead Hed been laying down his weapons When they filled him full of lead Now there seems no reason why I should carry on In this land that once was my land I cant find a home Its lonely and its quiet And the horse soldiers are coming And I think its time I strung my bow And ceased my senseless running For soon Ill find the yellow moon Along with my loved ones Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields Without the sound of guns And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Comes with a bullet hole,As I awoke this evening With the smell of woodsmoke clinging Like a gentle cobweb hanging Upon a painted tepee Oh I went to see my chieftain With my warlance and my woman For he told us that the yellow moon Would very soon be leaving This I cant believe I said I cant believe our Warlords dead Oh he would not leave the chosen ones To the buzzards and the soldiers guns Oh great father of the Iroquois Ever since I was young Ive read the writing of the smoke And breastfed on the sound of drums Ive learned to hurl the tomahawk And ride a painted pony wild To run the gauntlet of the Sioux To make a chieftains daughter mine And now you ask that I should watch The red mans race be slowly crushed What kind of words are these to hear From Yellow Dog whom white man fears I take only what is mine Lord My pony my squaw and my child I cant stay to see you

Brendas got a baby
Brendas got a baby
I hear Brendas got a baby but Brendas barely got a brain
A damn shame the girl can hardly spell her name
Thats not our problem thats up to Brendas family
Well let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie puttin death into his arms
Its sad cause I bet Brenda doesnt even know
Just cause youre in the ghetto doesnt mean you cant grow
But oh thats a thought my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who really didnt care to see or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas bellys gettin bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
Shes twelve years old and shes havin a baby
In love with a molester whos sexin her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that hell be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
She didnt know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
She didnt realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the babys in the trash heap bawlin
Mama cant help her but it hurts to hear her callin
Brenda wants to run away
Mama say You makin me lose pay
Theres social workers here every day
Now Brendas gotta make her own way
Cant go to her family they wont let her stay
No money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin robbed
So now whats next It aint nothin left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
Its payin the rent so she really cant complain
Prostitute found slain and Brendas her name
Shes got a baby

Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away cross the sea
Its been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go

It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh let me think let me think
What shall I do
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no

Remember walking hand in hand
Remember the night was so exciting
Remember her smile was so inviting
Remember then she touched my cheek
Remember with her fingertips

Softly we met with a kiss

Excursions of a searchin child
Should learn to take nothin personal
A parent hates to watch his babys face
Takin his first immunization shots but this is great
The childs introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words nothin is explained
Or rushed to the brain lookin up at his parents face
Like I thought you would protect me from this scary place
Whyd you let them inject me
Whos gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me
If Starbucks is bought by Nestl please dont arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I aint buy no espresso

In Italy Im Eduardo Baccari
But Nasty the hustler nasty like mustard gas sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia no pressure
My first house 11000squarefeet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways black cars and black ice
My second house still in my twenties illin with money
Chilled through my spine spillin wine its funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July bustin in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mobminded
Future Murcilago driver til Lambos got average on me
I started likin the look like I aint had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me just to inspire me
To stay focused its a real sick society
Just cause I got your support dont mean youre buyin me

2731,"Ive been living for the moment
But I just cant have my way
And Im afraid to go to sleep
Because tomorrow is today
People tell me life is sweeter
But I dont hear what they say
Nothing comes to change my life
So tomorrow is today
I dont care to know the hour
Because its passing anyway
I dont have to see tomorrow
Because I saw it yesterday
So I listen for an answer
But the feeling seems to stay
And whats the use of always dreaming
If tomorrow is today
Still Im waiting for the morning
But it feels so far away
And you dont need the love Im giving
So tomorrow is today
Oh my Im going to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me
Make my bed Im gonna lie in it
If you dont come Im sure gonna die in it
Too late too much giving
Ive seen a lot of life
And Im damn sick of living it
I keep hoping that you will pass my way
And someday if your dreams are leaving you
Ill still believe in you
I dont care to know the hour
Because its passing anyway
I dont have to see tomorrow
Because I saw it yesterday
Though Im living and Im singing
And although my hands still play
Soon enough it will all be over because
Tomorrow is today

Faith of my father my brother my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead
Is God dead
Rivers of evil run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow they kill steal and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole
When will this nightmare be over
Tell me
When can I empty my head
Will someone tell me the answer
Is God really dead
Is God really dead
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timings right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I dont need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I dont believe that God is dead
God is dead
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead
God is dead God is dead
God is dead God is dead right
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead

Each line that cuts my face
Cut as each hand moves into place

Bile black
The thoughts that run my head
Theres so much to be said
Theyre so much living dead

With nothing in their sight
Dance on their bones

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Cant make the same mistake this time
We are the children the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear until nothing else remains
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome
Looking for something we can rely on
Theres gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear until nothing else remains
All the children say
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome
So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

The sun and the waves

Where I thought the storm would never end
I saw your light on the horizon

And knocked my reindeer to the floor

PUMP PUMP Run you round the track then walk it off
So check for me take in a weapon and even steppin

Im stingy with the digits when I rock my rhyme
I bust a vein inside my brain
I came with the name and I claim the fame
Im hard to the core wicked and raw
The rhymes break raw when Im breakin your door

Vocal we makin em come to it then I have you very
Often lost in Runll run a boss then
Confuse you lose youre all lost up in the sauce

Ever come back to this world again
Kinda like it in a coma cause no ones ever gonna
Oh make me come back to this world again
Now I feel as if Im floating away
I cant feel all the pressure and I like it this way
But my bodys calling my bodys calling
Wont you come back to this world again
Suspended deep in a sea of black
Ive got the light at the end Ive got the bones on the mast
Well Ive gone sailing Ive gone sailing
I could leave so easily my friends are calling back to me
I said theyre theyre leavin it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is goin on
Goddamn it
Slipping farther and farther away
Its a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world thats full of shit
Help me
Okay lets get this guy in the program please were losing him Start an IV Please
Help Me
Come on His airways someones got to protect his airways I want two
Wheres the defibrillator
Two IVs over here please Thats two more now Were losing him
Lets go
Help Me
Slowmotion here This guys going
Bastard
Lets get him in ER
Going out on us
Whos got the defibrillator
Please understand me
Im climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just cant stifle all my screams
And Im waiting at the crossroads waiting for you
Waiting for you where are you
No ones going to bother me anymore
No ones going to mess with my head no more
I cant understand what all the fightings for
But its so nice here down off the shore
I wish you could see this cause theres nothing to see
Its peaceful here and its fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live ah
I know
Okay were starting to lose this guy I want that IV and his airway protected
Lets get some people in here
Get the crash cart please were losing this guy Hes going Give me an airway please
Going under
Clear
Zap him again
How about an IV stat
Okay you better protect the airway youre starting to lose him clear
Zap the son of a bitch again
Listen to me
Axl are you listening to me
Dont walk away from me
You are such a fucking prick I am so pissed with you
Get back over here
All I hear is bullshit all the time
All you ever wanna do is have sex sex sex
I just dont give a shit anymore
I love you
You live your life like its a coma wont you tell me why wed wanna
With all the reasons you give its its kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that Ive seen any reason why you should stay
Maybe wed be better off without you anyway
You got a oneway ticket on your last chance ride
Got a oneway ticket to your suicide
Got a oneway ticket and theres no way out alive
An all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isnt much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is then theres stories to be told
No you dont need a doctor no one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger they just stepped aside
They be down by the water while you watch em waving goodbye
They be calling in the morning they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer but you know nobodys home
When the bells stopped ringing it was nobodys fault but your own
There were always ample warnings there were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin but we gave you too much time
And when you said that no ones listening whyd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
An its so easy to be social its so easy to be cool
Yeah its easy to be hungry when you aint got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
But Im still out here waiting watching reruns of my life

Im going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Climb into my machine so we can cruise on out
I know a swinging little joint where we can jump and shout
Its not too far back off the highway not so long a ride
You park your car out in the open you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her maam
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed
Oh Carol dont let him steal your heart away

And if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight pat your foot dont let them carry it away
Dont let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Oh dont the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
You cant dance I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby because you dance so good

Its like Im in the dirt diggin up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
All it takes is one song on the radio youre
Right back on it reminding me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But Im coming for closure
Dont suppose an explanation Im owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh you thought it was over
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
Well Ive never recovered
But tonight bet you that what youre
Bout to go throughs tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges Mind saying Let it go fuck this
Hearts saying I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad
And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
Thought some time would pass and Id forget it Forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
May be gone but hes not forgotten
And dont think cause hes been out the picture so long that Ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya
Youre wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold
Have you any idea the shit that Ive gone through
Feelings I harbor All this pentup resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how Im doing
Letters you dont respond to em
Fuck it Im coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on ya
Poof then Im gone voosh
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
Ive been drivin around your side of this town
Like nine frickin hours and fortyfive minutes now
Finally I found your new address park in your drive
Feel like Ive been waitin on this moment all of my life
And its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and Im duckin on the side of your house
See its sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya but I aint here for your empathy
I dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
Its revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potentialI peeked Haha 
Continue to peep still bent low then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
All the way round to the back porch
Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
You dont plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue
Gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Ironys spectacular huh Now whos a faggot you punk
And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
Its just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it
Were in a car right nowwait here comes my favorite lyric
Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
Hows this for a publicity stunt This should be fun
Last album now cause after this youll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell
Bitch I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since youre in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits time is quite near
Hope we dont get stopped no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
As cops appear in my drivers side mirror
Oh God Police Agh 
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
New plan Stan
Slim Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car
Well gotta go almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro its for you Slim this is for him
And Frank Ocean oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
Im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
Im your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope its hopeless Im that denial that youre hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
Backs to the wall Im stackin up all them odds
Toilets clogged yeah cause Im talkin a lot of shit but Im backin it all up
But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
Im the ringing in your ears
Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
Grab for some water
But Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
Im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya
Every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona
Is half a facade and Matthew and Stans just symbolic
Of you not knowin what you had til its gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
Im the hindsight to say I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you dont stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
When its time to walk away Im every guilt trip
The baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
If theres anything you have left to say
Less it makes an impact then dont bother
So fore you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop A wallop 
So one last time Im back
Fore it fades into black and its all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh as we pick up where the last Mathers left off

So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same

Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me theres a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let em tell you that theyre all the same
Oh the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake watch out 
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
Ill meet you up there where the path runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin to find a woman whos never never never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself its not as hard hard hard as it seems mm

Not flesh nor fish nor bone
A red rag hangs from an open mouth
Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle
A tumbling and a bumbling he will go
All the Kings horses and all the Kings men
Could never put a smile on that face
Hes a sly one hes a shy one wouldnt you be too
Scared to be left out on his own
He hasnt a hasnt a friend to play with the ugly duckling
The pressure on the bubble will burst before our eyes
And all the while in perfect time
His tears are falling on the ground
But if you dont stand up you dont stand a chance
You dont stand a chance
Go a little faster now
You might get there in time

Stop your tears from falling
The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night
All to see at night
They come at night
In season out of season
Oh whats the difference when you dont know the reason
In one hand bread the other a stone
The hunter enters the forest
But all are not huntsmen who blow the huntsmans horn
And by the look of this one youve not got much to fear
Here I am Im very fierce and frightning
I come to match my skill to yours
Now listen here listen to me dont you run away now
I am a friend Id really like to play with you
Making noises my little furry friend would make
Ill trick him then Ill kick him into my sack
You better watch out you better watch out
Ive got you Ive got you
Youll never get away
Walking home that night
The sack across my back
The sound of sobbing on my shoulder
When suddenly it stopped
I opened up the sack all that I had
A pool of bubbles and tears just a pool of tears
Just a pool of tears
All in all you are a very dying race
Placing trust upon a cruel world
You never had the things you thought you shouldve had
And youll not get them now
And all the while in perfect time

2088,"The winters flaking snow is brushing through the pine wood trees
I stuff my hands down deep inside my coat
I think of years ago and half remembered Christmas trees
And faces that still warm me with their glow
The cold and empty evening hangs around me like a ghost
I listen to my footsteps in the snow
The sound of one man walking through the snow can break your heart
And stopping doesnt help so on Ill go
And Christmas Eve can kill you
When youre trying to hitch a ride to anywhere
The icy air Im breathings all that keeps me on my feet
I feel like Ive been walking all my life
A car goes running by the man dont even turn his head
Guess hes busy being Santa Claus tonight
The saddest part of all is knowing if I switched with him
Id leave him stumbling ragged by the road
Id ride that highway to the arms of my sweet family
And forget about the stranger in the cold
And Christmas Eve can kill you
When youre trying to hitch a ride to anywhere
And as I walk Im singing to myself O Silent Night
Hoping I can save those other souls
Oh God forgive the man that drives right by the other man
Take pity on the stranger in the cold
Cause Christmas Eve can kill you
When youre trying to hitch a ride to anywhere

Then you began to hang up me you studied to portray me
In ice and greens and old blue jeans and naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes that all your work discloses
Lady dont love me now I am dead
I am a saint turn down your bed
I have no heart thats what you said
You said I can be cruel but let me be gentle with you
Somewhere in a magazine I found a page about you
I see that now its Josephine who cannot be without you
I keep your house in fit repair I dust the portraits daily

Lady please love me now I am dead
I am a saint turn down your bed
I have no heart thats what you said
You said I can be cruel but let me be gentle with you
I gave you all my pretty years then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here while you went west for pleasure
And now youre flying back this way like some lost homing pigeon
Theyve monitored your brain you say and changed you with religion
Lady please love me now I was dead
I am no saint turn down your bed
Lady have you no heart thats what you said
Well I can be cruel but let me be gentle with you
When I first saw your gallery I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me and all their eyes look shady

Like bumping around the town like when youre driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles Isaac Newton a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite gettin ova with the key
Now rock shocker the mike of the many times times the times tables
Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new knowledge
An emcee to a degree that you cant get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
Ive got pegs through my hands and one through my feet

Kicked out of the Palladium dja think that I cared
Its the sounds of science the sounds of science

Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked and exploded

Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well I figured out who makes the crack its
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Professor of science cuz I keep droppin it
I smell weak cuz yall keep poppin it
People always ask me whats the phenomenon
Yo whats up Yo whats goin on
No one really knows what Im talkin about
And yeah thats right my names Yauch
Ponce De Leon constantly on
The fountain of youth not Robotron
Peace is a word Ive heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor
Cuz Im gonna die gonna die one day
Cuz Im goin and goin and goin this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
Im goin out first class aint goin out coach
Rock my Adidas never rock Filas
I do not sniff the coke I only smoke the sinsemilla
Well with my nose I knows and with my scope I scopes
What I live I write and thats strictly rope
I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equations
Well Cheech Wizard in a snow blizzard
Eat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy
Dropping science like Galileo dropped the orange

Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull tshirt
You say What did you do with him today
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
Cause youre my fella my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time Im out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
Upstairs in bed with my exboy
Hes in the place but I cant get joy
Thinkin on you in the final throes

3351,"Sad Songs Say So Much Lyrics
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And its times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know
Turn em on turn em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone ah 
Why dont you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room oh
Just feel their gentle touch gentle touch 
When all hope is gone ooh 
Sad songs say so much
If someone else is sufferin enough oh to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then its easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues
So turn em on turn em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone ah

What do you want me to do with it 
Dont matter just dont bite it

Slow is the tempo now talkin but a nympho
So peep it out here goes the info
This is a bitch that did the whole crew
She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through
And for the shit that she does give her a drum roll
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And shell let you videotape her
And if you got a gang of niggas the bitch would let you rape her
She likes suckin on dicks and lickin up nut
And they even take the broomstick up the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
But how many licks would it take she asks
To make MC Ren start gooshin up vanilla shakes
She took her tongue out her mouth put it on top
Like a cherry started movin it like a snake and it was very irresistible
I couldnt pay the bitch to quit
Cuz the ho was doin some ol crazy shit
That made me start havin a fit
Cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick 
Its the worlds biggest dick
Dont matter just dont bite it
Its the worlds biggest dick
Dont matter just dont bite it
What do you want me to do with it

Now one night I was at a drivein
And a car full of niggas straight drove in
I thought they wuz commin to start trouble but no
Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho
Now what do you expect theyre gonna dog her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windows all were foggy
And Im off in my car havin a fit cuz the bitch that Im with
Said no fuckin on the first date shit
And Im like Damn I wish I was in the bucket
To be the sixth nigga with the ho and I can fuck it
So I told the bitch I was with that Im goin to the snack bar
And got the fuck out the car
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next
I couldnt see her face all I saw was her pussy and her chest
I wanted to see the face I felt I oughta
Peep over the seat Oh shit Its the preachers daughter
And shes only 14 and a ho
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me I was surprised
But wasnt passin up the chance of my dick gettin baptized
I told the bitch to do it quick
You little ho hurry up and suck my dick
Its the worlds biggest dick
Dont matter just dont bite it
Its the worlds biggest dick
Dont matter just dont bite it
What do you want me to do with it 
Dont matter just dont bite it
She swallowed it 
Yeah Get it all baby 
Now Im a break it down with a fact
Since the last Just dont bite it girls dont know how to act
Sayin that they never would suck a dick
But when theyve tried it they couldnt quit
Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit
And those are the main ones that say they dont do it
But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it
So fellas next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick punch a bitch in the eye
And then the ho will fall to the ground
Then youll open up her mouth
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And shell catch on and start doin it on her own
Actin like shes tryin to suck the meat off a chicken bone
And then she wont let go
Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano
Get the last drop unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night
Because she just cant quit
Cuz shes addicted addicted
Shes addicted addicted
Shes addicted to suck a good dick

I realise that youve been hurt deep
Because Ive been there
But regardless to who what why when and where
Were all precious in his sight
And a rose is still and always will be a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
There was a rose I knew I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth hey hey
She never knew what hit her oh
Steal her honey then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn tryin to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power what I am is what I am 
Now believe me when I tell you that Ive been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you its you nobody else
And now youre so tough tryin to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin and flossin tryin to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh oh yeah
When she gets nearer
Shes cryin you cant hear her

Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power what I am is what I am 
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see youre lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Dont believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl love yourself enough to know
That without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
And without him your life goes on
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you

Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear
Oh dear oh dear oh dear
Dentist search their teeth for gold
Frisk the Jews for bank notes rolled
When they found out what they got
Line them up and shoot the lot
Kill a man be a man kill a man
Wonder what the Jews would say
If I told them where Boorman was today
Would they start a vendetta
Youd better ask Ernie Ledbetter

3643,"Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential levelwhat are we doing
Fooling ourselves clowning ourselves playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We cant babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we cant get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture thats painted
Tainted as the mind whos blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mindnumbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and dont look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon
Like memories of yesterday
Ninetysix gonna be that year
Ninetysix gonna be that year
Ninetysix gonna be that year
Ninetysix gonna be that year
I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see theyre making their paper so I guess I cant complain
Or can I I feel theyre disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving aint tasting right
My stomach cant digest it even when I bless it
Im confessing one more lesson from the South we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go head and diss it while real hophippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
Uhh born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
Its the nigga the BIG be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
Im thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew thinking theyre robbing you you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems Im reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Dont expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust us we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin niggas dippin
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
Our dearly beloved we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh like Liberty Bells yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we aint gon stop until we hit the big screen
Psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
So we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old
Like some eagles people dont understand
Just like their parents dont be caring
Im speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it get it but you aint pimping no bitches
Cause you flauging falling like leaves into driveways
Isnt it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
See all them leaves must fall down growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellowbrown
Autumn caught em see all them leaves must fall down growin old

I hated the moonlight
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling
Seemed flat as the moonlight
With no one to stay up for I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heard somebody whisper Please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

4664,"Long ago I wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion
Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didnt come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusion
Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears
So I found that life is just a game
But you know theres never been a winner
Try your hardest youll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when youre gone
Yeah when youre gone

Lord have mercy Jesus Christ
Hes just nice he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that Ive been through
Im the last real nigga alive thats official
Lord have mercy Jesus Christ
Hes just nice he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that Ive been through uhh 
Im the last real nigga alive thats official
Yall dont know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought Kick in the Door was for
But thats my heart yall still trippin off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and Ima tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin at the Fever streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues droppin out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin new rules
So I got in them shoes tried em wore them
Wasnt a perfect fit so I couldnt sport em
Young murderers ride I knew all them
Jungle got shot Will died we was warrin
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin I had a baby
I was makin my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed em in
With more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label Prince Rakeem had formed WuTang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it before Ready to Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performin at the Ark
Next thing you knew Big blew and all the ballin starts
He had Kim in his crew I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time him and Raekwon
My niggas but dig it they couldnt get along
Thats when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape
Bad Boy bitin Nas album cover wait
Big told me Rae was stealin my slang
And Rae told me out in Shaolin Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us but hit with Aint No Niggas
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today dont know nothin about this boss shit
Theres more shit than wantin to be this King of New York shit
Uhh uhh uhh
Lord have mercy Jesus Christ
Hes just nice he just slice like a Ginsu

Im the last real nigga alive thats official

Look at the life that Ive been through yeah 
Im the last real nigga alive thats official
Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest in peace Will Queensbridge live on
Theres some ghetto secrets I cant rhyme in this song
Theres some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point til I got to know him
We old friends but whats loyal
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the dramas on me
Cause previously it wouldve been against whoever
Friends forever
However I learned with some niggas its all business
But Im a street dude with morals
Then this niggas with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed stayed home never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone plannin
Baby moms thought I was too quiet couldnt stand it
She hit the streets later on she hittin the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs thinkin he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But thats her I aint mad baby it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores
In The Firm I learned I Am NAStradamus
QBs Finest Oochie Wally faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama
She was gettin old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times she asked would I make more songs
I told her not til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character degrade my hood
Cause in order for him to be the Don Nas had to go
The GamBINO rules I understood
What yall want see I already had
The Gift and The Curse Fuck that shit the first youll be last
Im the mans man a rappers rapper
GOD SON theyll be none after
I was Scarface Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo

It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind
Like painted kites those days and nights they went flyin by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
I lost you I lost you to the summer wind
The autumn wind and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end

4210,"The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
Here are we one magical moment
Such is the stuff from where dreams are woven
Bending sound dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you drive like a demon
From station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love
Wonder who wonder who wonder when
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink drink drain your glass raise your glass high
Its not the sideeffects of the cocaine

And put me on a train
Ive got no expectations
To pass through here again
Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
Its here and then its gone
So take me to the airport

Of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled fuel injected and steppin out over the line
Oh baby this town rips the bones from your back
Its a death trap its a suicide rap
We gotta get out while were young
Cause tramps like us baby we were born to run
Yes girl we were
Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
Well run till we drop baby well never go back
Oh will you walk with me out on the wire
Cause baby Im just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh can you show me
Beyond the palace hemipowered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
1 2 3 4 The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybodys out on the run tonight
But theres no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
Ill love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh someday girl I dont know when
Were gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go and well walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us
Baby we were born to run
Oh honey tramps like us

Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens it was the strings of my guitar
Amelia it was just a false alarm
The drone of flying engines is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue of picture postcard charms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
People will tell you where theyve gone theyll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise others just come to harm
Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm
I wish that he was here tonight its so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt as the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm
A ghost of aviation she was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending on beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
Maybe Ive never really loved I guess that is the truth
Ive spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel to shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia dreams and false alarms
",request of me to kindly stay away So this is how I hide the hurt as the road leads cursed and charmed I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm A ghost of aviation she was swallowed by the sky Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly Like Icarus ascending on beautiful foolish arms Amelia it was just a false alarm Maybe Ive never really loved I guess that is the truth Ive spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude And looking down on everything I crashed into his arms Amelia it was just a false alarm I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel to shower off the dust And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust I dreamed of 747s over geometric farms Dreams Amelia dreams and false alarms,I was driving across the burning desert when I spotted six jet planes Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain It was the hexagram of the heavens it was the strings of my guitar Amelia it was just a false alarm The drone of flying engines is a song so wild and blue It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you Then your life becomes a travelogue of picture postcard charms Amelia it was just a false alarm People will tell you where theyve gone theyll tell you where to go But till you get there yourself you never really know Where some have found their paradise others just come to harm Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm I wish that he was here tonight its so hard to obey His sad

This story starts off
Little boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does its back to the ghetto ghetto 
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto so he adapts to the ghetto
Yes the crack and the metal
He takes no days off for gettin his cocaine off off 
He ran back and fourth so much it pissed Jose off Psssss 
Now Jose was the cocaine boss boss 
Straight from Columbia his cocaine soft soft 
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off cuz he had love for his sister Take that Take that 
And shorty had no love for his sister
Cuz his sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for em both
Plus he was good at handlin coke so Jose liked him
Problem was he was pitchin for the dudes down the street Who 
You know TJ Big Boo and Malik Word 
Malik is a killer Boo is a killer Yep 
TJ well hes just another nigga
But despite the fact what they didnt like the fact
That he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And being that he was a pitcher here in the winter air What happened 
They set it up to get him there and hit him there Damn 
But shorty was smart
So before they got to load and spark
He said hold up my heart Hold up hold up Please
Then he said please look up in my bag Look 
Theres cook up in my bag its all good up in my bag Here 
And theres more where that came from
I get it from Jose believe me theres more where that came from
Yeah he had em lost and the game won won 
They let him go yeah thinkin he would let em know What 
Where Jose was keepin that heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that Bout that 
And we all know Jose bout that Bout that 
Next thing you know he seen Jose slouch back What 
In the chair like Theres no way out that Nope 
He said Shoot em Imma blow they house back Back 
Next day he sent the two way out town And 
And somebody blew they house down Damn 
Jose think shorty on his side
But he dont know shorty on his side Word 
So shorty called Jose like Listen Listen 
Its going down I need more cocaine Bring it 
So we met up Met up it was a set up
Guess who TJ Malik and Boo sped up Wow 
You shouldve seen the look on Joses face
You never seen the look on old mans face Nope 
Told him no mans great
And its no mans place to fuck wit no mans fam
Then he said Wheres my sister fore I kill you

3536,"I got the call today I didnt wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside loves open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew Im learning again
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
Theres a yearning undefined
People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and selfassurance that can lead to happiness
Theyre the very things we kill I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
Doesnt keep me warm
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you Baby
The more I know the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out I have to learn again
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
There are people in your life whove come and gone
They let you down and hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you life goes on
You keep carrin that anger itll eat you inside
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So Im thinkin about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore

Take the wrong way out running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night
A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find
See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine
Laughing sorrow inside your head
Cant get out just a feeling of dread
I know this burdens a heavy load

A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough euphorias high
More borrowed money more borrowed time
Backed in a corner caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Natures scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries loss of all pride
To leave aint believin so try and be tried
Insufficient funds insanity and suicide
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
The Congress will push me to raise taxes and Ill say no read my lips read my lips read my lips read my lips read my lips
Now with new hope some will be proud
This is no hoax no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed no dividend
Some may ask Why

Yeah its my life
In my own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for
Not the expression no literally give an arm for
When they know theyre your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
Daddy look what I made Dads gotta go catch a plane
Daddy wheres Mommy I cant find Mommy where is she
I dont know go play Hailie baby your daddys busy

1526,"Right about now NWA court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of NWA versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren Ice Cube
And EazymotherfuckingE
Order order order
Ice Cube take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass
You goddamn right
Well wont you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say
Fuck the police comin straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause Im brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit cause I aint the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toetotoe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin with me cause Im a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin my car lookin for the product
Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics
Youd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin in a Benzo
Beat a police out of shape
And when Im finished bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I dont know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand without a gun they cant get none
But dont let it be a black and a white one
Cause theyll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause Im from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when Im finished its gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in LAÂ 
Yo Dre I got something to say
Fuck the police fuck fuck
Fuck the police fuck fuck
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police Example of scene one 
Pull your goddamn ass over right now
Aw shit now what the fuck you pullin me over for
Cause I feel like it
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
Man fuck this shit
Alright smartass Im taking your black ass to jail
MC Ren will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever Im steppin
And the motherfuckin weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the socalled law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But theyre scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit dont work I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police Im saying Fuck you punk
Reading my rights and shit its all junk
Pulling out a silly club so you stand
With a fakeass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see whats up
And well go at it punk and Ima fuck you up
Make you think Ima kick your ass
But drop your gat and Rens gonna blast
Im sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But Ima smoke em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
Im a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin out a cop or two they cant cope with me
The motherfuckin villain thats mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So Ima turn it around
Put in my clip yo and this is the sound Gunshots 
Yeah somethin like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren dont give a fuck to say
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police fuck the fuck
Fuck the police
Knocking
Yeah man what you need
Police open now Aww shit 
We have a warrant for EazyEs arrest Battering ram 
Get down and put your hands right where I can see em Move motherfucker move now 
What the fuck did I do man What did I do
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor You heard the man shut the fuck up 
But I didnt do shit
Man just shut the fuck up
EazyE wont you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit
Im tired of the motherfuckin jackin
Sweating my gang while Im chillin in the shack and
Shining the light in my face and for what
Maybe its because I kick so much butt
I kick ass or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when Im playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah Im a gangsta but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge what do you got
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat it dont matter if hes smaller or bigger
Size dont mean shit hes from the old school fool 
And as you all know Es here to rule
Whenever Im rollin keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue yo so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if Im rollin off the eight hell be the one
That I take out and then get away
While Im driving off laughing this is what Ill say
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police fuck
Fuck the police fuck fuck
Fuck the police The verdict 
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck white bread chicken shit motherfucker
Wait thats a lie Thats a goddamn lie
Get him out of here I want justice 
Get him the fuck out my face I want justice

And roam all over coliseum floors
I stepped on stage at Live Aid
All the people gave and the poor got paid
And out of speakers I did speak
I wore my sneakers but Im not a sneak
My Adidas touch the sand of a foreign land
With mic in hand I cold took command
My Adidas and me close as can be
We make a mean team my Adidas and me
We get around together were down forever
And we wont be mad when caught in bad weather
My Adidas
Uh 
My Adidas
Uh 
Yo whats up
My Adidas standin on two fifth street
Funky fresh and yes cold on my feet
With no shoestring in em I did not win em
I bought em off the ave with the black Lee denim
I like to sport em thats why I brought em
A sucker tried to steal em so I caught em and I fought em
And I walk down the street and bop to the beat
With Lee on my legs and Adidas on my feet
And so now Im just standin here shootin the gip
Me and D and my Adidas standing on two fifth
My Adidas
My Adidas
Now me and my Adidas do the illest things
We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
We slay all suckers who perpetrate
And lay down law from state to state
We travel on gravel dirt road or street
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat
On stage front page every show I go
Its Adidas on my feet high top or low
My Adidas
My Adidas
What up what up what up
Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare
Myself homeboy got fifty pair
Got blue and black cause I likes to chill
And yellow and green when its time to get ill
Got a pair that I wear when Im playin ball
With the heel inside make me ten feet tall
My Adidas only bring good news
And they are not used as felon shoes
Theyre black and white white with black stripes
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of a famous university
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen
Hollywood knows were good if you know what I mean
We started in the alley now we chill in Cali
And I wont trade my Adidas for no beat up Ballys

He went for his to find he didnt have one
Put him in check correct with my egggun
The egg a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke
The trigger I pulled his face the yolk
Reached in his pocket took all his cash

When you first gave it to me To me 
Your sweet kiss of fire
The burning flame of love
Started mounting higher Oohoooo 
Til it consumed my heart and soul And soul 
And like King Midas loved his gold His gold 
I wanted you alone to hold
And your kiss of fire And your kiss of fire 
Your sweet kiss of fire Your sweet kiss of fire 
Your sweet kiss of fire Your sweet kiss of fire 
And then you took it away Away 
Your sweet kiss of fire
Taking the thrill out of love
Killing my desire Oohoooo

Like a fish without the sea The tree 
Im as cold as cold can be
Without your kiss of fire Without your kiss of fire

After showing me the way to love
Just come on and make me
Warm as the sun that shines above

The sun went down on another perfect day
Busy counting shadows on the wall
The weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
Roses in the whiskey jar blood on the thorns
Drink until the taste is gone
Cracks in the floorboards are deep from dancing
To the sound of candles burning out
Heavy from writing your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone
Where is your ShangriLa now

Counting down to zero hours
There aint no superheroes now
There aint no superheroes theyre underground

2760,"Woe to you oer Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixtysix
I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy
Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
Cos in my dreams its always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah
Night was black was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun Satans work is done
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This cant go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize cant avoid the eyes
Sixsixsix the number of the beast

And Ill possess your body and Ill make you burn

She wrote to the devil
And asked him to pay

She gathered together
Some shells for her head
She rode and she rode on

The Lord took her away from me
Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddys car
We hadnt driven very far
There in the road straight ahead
A car was stalled the engine was dead
I couldnt stop so I swerved to the right
Ill never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last
Oh where oh where can my baby be

Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
When I woke up the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head she looked at me and said
Hold me darling just a little while
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now shes gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life that night

1746,"Two hearts that shouldnt
Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell
People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories theyd tell
If anyone would listen
If anyone would listen
You come from a town where
People dont bother saying Hello
Unless somebodys born or dies
And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But its much too late when the fear is gone
I will meet you in the next life I promise you 
Where we can be together I promise you 
I will wait til then in Heaven I promise you 
I promise I promise
Theres so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved
Their intentions arent that good
And I can smell the asphalt
Thats their personal road to Hell being paved
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
And its much too late when the fear is gone
I will meet you in the next life I promise you

Maybe put on a harmony

On the uptown hot block he got his side sprayed up

Yo still in all we livin just dream about the getback
That made him smile though his eyes said pray for me
Ill do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully

Mmmm these dreams of you
So real and so true

My back was up against the wall
And you slowly just walked away
You never really heard my call

Ladies and gentlemen lets put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You couldve been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
I appreciate that
Uh
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed got rid of that dirt for them
Wasnt born hustlers I was birthing em
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome it aint easy
Cops want to knock me DA wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty he who does not feel me
Is not real to me therefore he doesnt exist
So poof vamoose son of a bitch
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty yall got to feel me
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up Holla at me 
I do this for my culture to let em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me Im raisin the status quo up
Im overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk but money talks so talk more bucks

For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty yall got to feel me
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
Yeah Hov is back life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack Yeah 
Like I told you sell drugs no Hov did that
So hopefully you wont have to go through that
I was raised in the projects roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin they mamas sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost why I got my hand closed
Cracks in my palm watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
Ive seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiends weight
To try and to fail the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game the two things thats great
H to the izzO V to the izzA
What else can I say about dude I gets busy

348,"Tulane and Johnny opened a novelty shop
Back under the counter was the cream of the crop
Everything was clicking and the business was good

Johnny jumped the counter but he stumbled and fell

Go Tulane he aint man enough for you
Go Tulane use all the speed you got
Go Tulane you know you need a lot

And see if he will loan us something soon as you hit the door
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room
Go by Doctor Keller and tell him you swallowed some perfume
Tell him we need him quick because he may have to testify
That you been sick all day and thats a perfect alibi

2951,"A girl named Mary dreamed of being in love
Gathering water by a lonely road
An angel came and whispered very low
You are the one that our God has chose
To have the Savior as it was told
To many prophets so long ago
And then he placed his hand upon her there
And she knew then the Savior she would bear
At Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
He rendered her a name that none would share
Except when faithfully kneeling in prayer
And she furrowed and said the name of Christ
And knew the dream would happen in life
At Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
Oh you know its Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
To Joseph she exclaimed in truth that night
Of how the angel came with all his light
And soon they went and traveled to the place
Where one bright star would show where his head laid
When all men came from near and afar
To honor glory to the Son of God
And in the manger quietly he lay
Wise men and shepherds knelt by him to pray
Its Christmastime

Live for you fresh
For all you sucker MCs perpetratin a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
Youre the kind of guy that girl ignored
Im drivin a Caddy you fixin a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle names Ward
And when Im rockin on the mic you should all applaud
Because were wheelin dealin we got a funny feelin
We rock from the floor up to the ceilin
We groove it you move it it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin
We create it relate it and often demonstrate it
Well diss a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it
Were risin suprisin and often hypnotizin
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls no braids peasyhead and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and crossfades
Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didnt fail
I couldnt wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
Im a wizard of a word thats what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
Im the master of a mic thats what I say
And if I didnt say that youd say it any way
Bust into the party come in the place
See the first things come the music in your face
Girls on the walls some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it cant be missed
And you cant leave til youre dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you cant leave until were through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade thats not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok youre not in a rut
Each and everybody out there we got the notion
We want to see yall all in motion
Just shake wiggle jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side back and forth
Were the two MCs and were gonna go off
Stand in place walk or run
Tap your feet youll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJs better than all these bands
Huh
We got all the lines and all the rhymes
We dont drop dimes and we dont do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear the pants they call the Calvin Kleins
Cause Calvin Kleins no friend of mine
Dont want nobodys name on my behind
Lee on my legs sneakers on my feet

But I cant be there and will you still care
Will I cheat or will I be committed Heaven knows
Getting weak and I wanna hit it so here I go
In my ride and Im all in gettin high

Everybody knows Im balling and to God
Gotta keep myself from falling but its hard
All the cuties know Im under pressure what do I do
Getting shaky when she pull the dress up and say its cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while You decide
If you tell me that you dont want it thats a lie
Move close and let me whisper some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby dont rush I like it slow

3263,"I Thought It Took a Little Time But Today I Fell in Love Lyrics
Am I really hard to please
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me
My friends all fall so easily
But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so
Cause the feeling was so unexpected
I could hardly keep myself collected
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin
Never did believe in lovin on sight
I thought it took time to learn about lovin
All I know is now its gotta be right
In the midst of conversation he looked into my eyes
And all through the conversation much to my own surprise
Half the words he said to me were missin
Cause my mind was so intent on kissin
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin
Never did believe in lovin on sight
I thought it took time to learn about lovin
All I know is now its gotta be right
Am I really hard to please
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me
My friends all fall so easily
But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so
And the feelin was so deep inside me
I could feel it when he brushed beside me
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin
Never did believe in lovin on sight
I thought it took time to learn about lovin
All I know is now its gotta be right
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin
Never did believe in lovin on sight

High or low it was the same
Easy money and faithless women
Redeye whiskey for the pain
Go down Bill Dalton it must be Gods will
Two brothers lying dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now
Theyre no damn good
Better keep on moving DoolinDalton
Till your shadow sets you free
If youre fast and if youre lucky
You will never see that hanging tree
Well the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waiting for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy Lord cause nothing ever changed
Until Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap just biding time
Then he laughed and said Im going
And so he left that peaceful life behind

379,"Did you ever see the faces of the children They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning hours before the winter suns ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean including heavens generosity
Peeping round the door to see what parcels are for free in curiosity
And Tommy doesnt know what day it is
He doesnt know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave
Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently and unaware of anything
Playing poxy pinball picks his nose and smiles and pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love but how can men whove never seen light be enlightened
Only if hes cured will his spirits future level ever heighten
And Tommy doesnt know what day it is
He doesnt know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave

1902,"Up In The Studio Gettin Blown Freestyle Lyrics
Im just cut from a different cloth
And they dont make this fabric no more
That money coming Im grabbin it all
Triple beam leaning still balancing raw
Still got the white Macklemore
Car seat smelling like I just ripped the packing off
Run down on me in traffic Im backin em off
Sex money and murder mastered it all
Shout out to my macs but Im Billy though
Still on that gangland shit really though
Got a couple locs that Im close with
And theyll Shmurda dance on your whole shit
Free Bobby free Rowdy free the whole 9
Free Duski free Chewie free my old Ys
Act up we at your neck like bowties
Belly shit bringing niggas gifts in a whole 9
Might send your woman crush on a road trip
That pussy stuffed with a whole brick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
Buy it by the pounds smoking by the zip
Buy em by the rounds shoot em by the clip
Everybody down everybody hit
I said everybody down everybody hit
Nowadays the game full of lames and straight gays
Niggas throwing shade and hate from a fake page
Niggas catfishing for asswhippings
Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death blood on this Raf Simons
Fiends like Santana where you at with it
Back like cooked crack yall done gave too many bad fixes
Looking at my Rollie its bout that time yo
Extended clip have your whip jumping like pot holes
Yeah Im the main event you the side show
Times up mine go hit em with the Young MA flow 
I think these niggas think I lost my mojo
No I think its time I let these niggas know so
They cant fuck with me and they know so
Im out here rocking Gucci like its Polo
Stil drippin sauce thats that Mojo
They know I got that spice that Adobo
And Im still selling coke tho
Let me stop you niggas cops Robo
My nigga Black an animal stay on go mode
Bounce keep the tre cinco ocho
Chewie coming home they like oh no
Cause they know how he playing with that 45
Aint talkin weed when I tell my niggas blow smoke
Aint talkin rain when I say youll get your clothes soaked
Watch my name when you rap might get your throat choke
Might tell your bitch to come over get these slow pokes
She gon get each and every one of her holes poked
Lil Yachty in that pussy I got that row boat
Yeah back on the heels again
Born to lose build to win
Yall niggas know now

666,"If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Ive got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my caskets closed
Rap critics that say hes Money Cash Hoes
Im from the hood stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
Youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
Im like Fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I dont play they show
They dont play my hits well I dont give a shit so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads
Fuckers I dont know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
Im from rags to riches niggas I aint dumb
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
The year is 94 in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
Got two choices yall pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor
And I aint tryin to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard Son do you know why Im stopping you for
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir I dont know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more
Well you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are
I aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
Arent you sharp as a tack
You some type of lawyer or something
Somebody important or something
Well I aint passed the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you wont illegally search my shit
Well well see how smart you are when the K9 come
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin a pussy
But a pussy havin no goddamn sense try and push me
I try to ignore him talk to the Lord
Pray for him but some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motorbike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing thats gon happen is Ima get to clappin
And he and his boys gonna be yappin to the Captain
And there I go trapped in the KitKat again
Back through the system with the riffraff again
Fiends on the floor scratchin again
Paparazzis with they cameras snappin em
DA try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil for bail cause Im African
All because this fool was harassin them
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccharine
But aint nothin sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems bein a bitch aint one hit me

2663,"No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
The hardest part this troubled heart has never yet been through now
Was to heal the scars that got their start inside someone like you now
Boy had I known or Id been shown back when how long itd take me
To break the charms that brought me harm and all but would erase me
I never would hope that I could no matter what youd pay me
Replay the part you stole my heart I shouldve known youre crazy
If all I knew was that with you Id want someone to save me
Itd be enough but just my luck I fell in love and maybe
All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better
So bittersweet this tragedy wont ask for absolution
This melody inside of me still searches for solution

A broken heart to provide the spark for my determination

After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

About to lose my breath
Theres no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door
And every road that Ive taken mmm
Led to my regret
And I dont know if Im gon make it

1783,"I Believe When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever Lyrics
Shattered dreams
Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began
Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Without despair
We will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been
Must never end
And with the strength we have wont be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They wont be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind
Mm
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Ever ever ever ever
Ow
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you

491,"Fifteen years in the academy
He was like no cadet theyd ever seen
A man so hard his veins bleed ice
When he speaks he never says it twice
They call him Judge his last name is Dredd
So break the law and youll wind up dead
Truth and justice are what hes fighting for
Judge Dredd the man he is the law
Drokk it
With his gun and bike he rules the streets
Every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even Death will overcome his might
Dredd and Anderson they won the fight
When the Sovs started the Apocalypse war
MegaCity was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted and the judges fought back
Crushed the Sovs with their counterattack

I had to make good time to see you but you had to pay the fine
All the boys on my side knew that you were the shark
If you were found on the borderline youd be shot in the dark

Dont go out DTK youll wear your best suit in the ground
Were meeting in a neutral zone the last car on the train
The love you brought shaking up my bones and crawling through our veins
We always met at the edge of a blade and we left at the end of the fight
Of all the girls youve played and you laid why did this one have to be white
Theyre going to get you at twelve oclock high got their sights set low on you

218,"Ms Jackson Lyrics
Yeah this one right here goes out
To all the babys mamas mamas
Mamas mamas baby mamas mamas
Yeah go like this
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
My babys drama mama dont like me
She be doin things like havin them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
Thats my house Ill disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school daycare shit medical billsI pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see I aint the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries cookouts for my childs birthday I aint invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you yeah
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin on
You say its puppy love we say its fullgrown Arroof 
Hope that we feel this feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you cant predict the weather
Ms Jackson
Ten times out of nine now if Im lyin find
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and Ill decline
King meets queen then the puppy love thing
Together dream bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree I hope we feel like this forever
Forever forever ever Forever ever
Forever never seems that long until youre grown
And notice that the daybyday ruler cant be too wrong
Ms Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me thoughts of she thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it need some knee pads
It happened for a reason one cant be mad
So know this know that everythings cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Look at the way he treats me
Shit look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosyass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl aint speakin no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what Im talkin about
Jealousy infidelity envy cheating beating
In the year 2G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on
You keep on singin the same song let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on you and your mama
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Two multimillionaire motherfuckers catchin cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down the shits about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown

You might be deep in this game but you got the rules missin
Niggas be actin like they savage they out to get the cabbage
Ive got nothin but love for my niggas livin lavish
Ive got a pit named Petey she Nigerino
Ive got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think Ive got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you babybubba
You see this is for the Gs and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous

Lookin hard but wont realize
That they will never see the P

Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickelplated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire now them niggas bleedin
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West dont get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe Nigga you aint know
They got me stressed out on Death Row
Ive seen money but baby Ive gots to get mo
You screamin Go 2Pac and I aint stoppin till Im wellpaid
Bails paid now nigga look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise until I die
Ask me why Im a boss player gettin high
And when Im rollin by niggas cant see me
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And youll never realize
You cant see me
Been gettin word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin they can get with us but picture me gettin served
My own mama say Im thugged out
My shit be poppin out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what It aint nothin but a party when we thug
And there I was a young nigga with heart aint had shit to lose
Pullin my pistol on them fools you know the rules
DRE you got me heated my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin bitches where its most needed
Money and weed Aliz and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down witness me
Bail on these hoes in flossmode

My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets niggas cant see me
Niggas cant see me
They cant see me
Which way did he go George
Which way did he go
Oh Which way did he go
Which way did he go
You niggas made a mistake
You shouldve never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and its judgement day
Hey homie if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed they aint kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake rattle and roll
Im full of liquor thug nigga quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a niggas aim is
Im just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin bring me money then Im rappin till Im paid
Im gettin green like Im supposed to
Nigga I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut

Well I just got into town about an hour ago

Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars the topless bars

3673,"Infinite dreams I cant deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldnt hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid a nightmares statue
What a dream when will it end and will I transcend
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
Its getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now in too deep
Even though its reached new heights
Id rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder makes me think
Theres more to this Im on the brink
Its not the fear of whats beyond
Its just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in
Cant be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me youre an unbeliever
Spiritualist
Well me Im neither
Wouldnt you like to know the truth
Of whats out there to have the proof
And find out just which side youre on
Where would you end
In Heaven or in Hell
Argh Oh
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams ow
Theres got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
Id like to think that when I die
Id get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate play the game
Again and again and again and again

America Ha ha ha We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to upholdÂ or so were told
Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song 
I never wouldve dreamed in a million years Id see
So many motherfuckin people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
Its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me
So many lives I touched so much anger aimed
In no particular direction just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who wouldve thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair
With some peroxide reachin for a tshirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep tellin me I aint causin nothin but problems
And now theyre sayin Im in trouble with the government
Im lovin it I shoveled shit all my life and now Im dumpin it on
White America I could be one of your kids
White America Little Eric looks just like this
White America Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah 
White America I could be one of your kids
White America Little Eric looks just like this
White America Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL look how many hugs I get
Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shadyd lose Shady sits on the shelf
But Shadys cute Shady knew Shadys dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby Ooh baby  Look at my sales
Lets do the math If I was black I wouldve sold half
I aint have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap so fuck school Im too cool to go back
Give me the mic Show me where the fuckin studios at
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up I was like
Fuck it until I met Dre the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got
Was probly his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow
Im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now Its
White America I could be one of your kids

I go to TRL look how many hugs I get Yah 
White America I could be one of your kids

White America Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL look how many hugs I get
See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise wouldve never knew these words exist
Whose moms probly wouldve never gave two squirts of piss
Til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence
Straight out the tube right into your livin rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
Waitin to choke tightenin around my throat
Watchin me while I write this like I dont like this note
All I hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hiphop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom
So now Im catchin the flak from these activists when they raggin
Actin like Im the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit
Just look at me like Im your closest pal
The poster child the motherfuckin spokesman now for

So to the parents of America I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the galf and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms Cheney Fuck you Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have Fuck you

1362,"Again and again the same situation
For so many years
Tethered to a ringing telephone
In a room full of mirrors
A pretty girl in your bathroom
Checking out her sex appeal
I asked myself when you said you loved me
Do you think this can be real
Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering where it had to go
With heaven full of astronauts
And the Lord on death row
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Call out and clamour to be found
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And their search for love that sticks around
Youve had lots of lovely women
Now you turn your gaze to me
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
To see if Im worthy
Like the church like a cop like a mother
You want me to be truthful
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
And I need your approval
Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering who was there to hear
I said Send me somebody
Whos strong and somewhat sincere
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
I called out to be released
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
And my search for love that dont seem to cease
",of lovely women Now you turn your gaze to me Weighing the beauty and the imperfection To see if Im worthy Like the church like a cop like a mother You want me to be truthful Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though And I need your approval Still I sent up my prayer Wondering who was there to hear I said Send me somebody Whos strong and somewhat sincere With the millions of the lost and lonely ones I called out to be released Caught in my struggle for higher achievements And my search for love that dont seem to cease,Again and again the same situation For so many years Tethered to a ringing telephone In a room full of mirrors A pretty girl in your bathroom Checking out her sex appeal I asked myself when you said you loved me Do you think this can be real Still I sent up my prayer Wondering where it had to go With heaven full of astronauts And the Lord on death row While the millions of his lost and lonely ones Call out and clamour to be found Caught in their struggle for higher positions And their search for love that sticks around Youve had lots

1077,"Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
Were captive on the carousel of time
We cant return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when youre older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
Were captive on the carousel of time
We cant return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him Take your time it wont be long now
Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
Were captive on the carousel of time
We cant return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
Therell be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
Were captive on the carousel of time
We cant return we can only look
Behind from where we came

And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
And well wear it till the night comes
Woke up it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Blue red green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
Theres a sun show every second
Now the curtain opens
On a portait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away
Woke up it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
And well talk in present tenses
When the curtain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewellight
If only you will stay
Pretty baby wont you

Cause she thinks shes
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
Jackets shoes everyday ties
The girl only wants one of those guys
Suckers who front like it aint no thing
Pretend to be friends dont want that thang
Talk like this uh dont talk slang
Do anything to get that thang
Tries to be chic and playin it off
Peekin through the window I saw her take her clothes off
Nasty girl a stone cold freak
Stayin in the bed a whole goddamn week
Comin and leavin guys servin up storms
From execs with checks boys from the dorms
Never kept a name never seen a face
She could pass em in the street like it never took place
I know shes a ho so Ima go
Expose the funky bitch
Cause she thinks shes
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
Now she wants a sucker boy with an attache
And if you aint got it shell turn you away
You can smile with style as you profile
Cause you got a gold tooth and she thinks youre wild
She dont want a brother thats true and black
If youre light youre alright better you stay back
Cause the sucker with the bag is out the cat
With somethin in his bag keepin her attached
The man got a plan its IBM
The devil at her level yes it is him
His Audi she rides his gold and clothes
The ill base method turnin up her nose
Lack a lack a lack cold beamin her up
She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
Her status looks at us from down below
Now the bitch is in trouble
Cause she was
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
Little is known about her past
So listen to me cause I know her ass
Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes
And never got caught so the story goes
She kept doin that to all her men
Found the wrong man when she did it again
And still to this day people wonder why
Did he beat the bitch down til she almost died
Phisticated

1934,"Take These Chains Lyrics
I move away it dont do me no good
Three thousand miles dont help like I thought it would
Help me begging you please
You got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Reach out to me as if from the grave
I tried to run but Im tied to you like a slave
Its my fault loving you so
You were so precious how could I know
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
I dont owe you anything
Why dont you get out of my life
Through it all the memories cling
And I cant sleep at night
Help me Im begging you please
You got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart

517,"It wasnt really sad the way they said goodbye
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldnt cry
He packed his things walked out the door and drove away
And she became the girl from yesterday
He took a plane across the sea
To some foreign land
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand
How someone who had been so close could be so far away
And she became the girl from yesterday
She doesnt know whats right
She doesnt know whats wrong
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long
And she doesnt count the teardrops
That shes cried while hes away
Because she knows deep in her heart
That hell be back someday
The lights on in the window shes waiting by the phone
Talking to a memory thats never coming home
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say
But shell always be the girl from yesterday

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said No no no
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
I aint got the time and if my daddy thinks Im fine
Hes tried to make me go to rehab but I wont go go go
Id rather be at home with Ray

That I cant learn from Mr Hathaway

But I know it dont come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no

Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow
And I said Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow Im going to be by your side
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the childs sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand you are going to be my man
You are going to rise
And then she took me high over yonder
And I said Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side

And from around the world the cry was

Long live the king Long live the king

Every Johnny Joe and Jack that the king is back

Gonna have a celebration for the king returns

Now Im gonna sing and shout it
There aint no doubt about it
Im the king of rock and roll

But I can beat his with my king sized 
Ike and Tina Turner got an earthquake sound
But Im the man from Macon and Im gonna put em down
Elvis Presley have you heard the news
Im gonna walk over your blue suede shoes
One and two Three Dog Night
I bet your bark is much bigger than your bite

Dont you know your honor
Tell Sly and the Stone to leave rock and roll alone
Aretha Franklin is the queen of soul

2806,"Hear the rime of the ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
And the music plays on as the bride passes by
Caught by a spell and the Mariner tells his tale
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobodys been
Through the snow fog flies on the Albatross
Hailed in Gods name hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the Albatross follows on
The Mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what hes done
But when the fog clears they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north til all is calm
The Albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck the dead bird is hung
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
Day after day day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water water everywhere nor any drop to drink
There calls the Mariner There comes a ship oer the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide
See onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See she has no crew
She has no life wait but theres two
Death and she LifeinDeath
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now
Then crew one by one
They drop down dead two hundred men
She she LifeinDeath
She lets him live her chosen one
One after one by the stardogged Moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
And I heard nor sigh nor groan
With heavy thump a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one
The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished hed die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on so did he
And by the light of the Moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
Gods creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The Albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain Hahahaha
Hear the groans of the longdead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and theyre lifeless in their eyes
And revenge still is sought penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the longdead bodies
Form their own light and the Mariners left alone
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilots boat his son and the Hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins
The Mariners bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach Gods word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made
And the Wedding guests a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on

Kick that shit
scratched City of Compton
scratched City of Compton echoes
Cold kickin ass scratch cold kickin ass scratch
Cold kickin ass scratch Kick that shit
Pull up a chair echoes
I dont drink brass monkey like the beat funky
Nickname EazyE yo 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kickin to show my shit
Rappin holdin my dick boy I dont quit
Crowd rockin motherfucker from around the way
I got a sixshooter yo mean hombre
Rollin through the hood to find the boys
To kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and its freezin my balls
I hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gayes greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whompin
Cruisin through the Eastside south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
I was Cold kickin ass
I was Raised in LA
I was Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Too much posse
Ridin on Slauson lookin for Crenshaw
Turned down the sound to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tilt cause I was drunk
See a sissyass punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause its like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall
And we puttin it on wax
Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall
YEAH guitar riff
Olde English 800 cause thats my brand
Take it in a bottle 40 quart or can
Drink it like a madman yes I do
Fuck the police and a 5O too
Stepped in the party I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said Eric yo breath smells
40 ounce in hand thats what I got
Yo man you see Eazy hurling in the parkin lot
Stepped on your foot cold dissed yo ho
Asked her to dance and she said Hell no 
Called her a bitch cause thats the rule
Bitch who you callin a bitch 
Boys in the hood tryin to keep me cool
You tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get em up
I start droppin the dogs and watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum got knocked out cold
Made you look sick you snottynosed prick
Now your fly bitch is all over his dick
Punk got dropped cause the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
Stomp a mudhole in your ass
Stomp a mudhole in your ass BITCH
Pass the brew motherfucker while I tear shit up
And yall listen up close to roll call
EazyEs in the place I got money and juice
RonDeVu with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so goddamn funky
Do the Olde 8 fuck the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
Hail to the niggas from CIA
Krazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams so fuck respect
Make a toast punkypunk to the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin

And then you left me said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But the heartaches in me til this day
You didnt stand by me
No not at all
You didnt stand by me
No way
All the times when we were close
Ill remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumblin down
I cant be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And theres only one thing I can say
You didnt stand by me
No not at all
You didnt stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Now I got a job but it dont pay
I need new clothes I need somewhere to stay
But without all of these things I can do
But without your love I wont make it through
But you dont understand my point of view
I suppose theres nothing I can do
You didnt stand by me
No not at all
You didnt stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie

Well snap for yo slice of life Im tellin ya why

The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere to go

Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And thats that sport sport
Pray I live to see the day when Sevens happily married with kids
Woe woe

Abomination desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe woe to the man that strive with his maker on Judgment Day

So cool king of the scene
You found that making people laugh
Was more than just a dream
The public took right to you

But success just couldnt fit
Wasting your life
No future is bright
Dancing on your grave

Yet you couldnt find your niche

Helps you dig your daily ditch
The bottom line cant touch you
Cause youre above the rest

Cause you know they know whats up
So we started lookin for the bitches with the big butts

I got a boyfriend bitch stop lyin
Dumbass hooker aint nothin but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I dont like
Walked over to em and said Whats up
The first nigga that I saw hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin him and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door but we dont quit
Ren said Lets start some shit
I got a shotgun and heres the plot
Takin niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom Boom Boom Yeah I was gunnin
And then you look all you see is niggas runnin
And fallin and yellin and pushin and screamin and cussin
I stepped back and I kept bustin
And then I realized its time for me to go

See a nigga on Daytons and we creep

I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin I jumped in the bucket
We couldnt catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didnt get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car are you crazy
She was scared and it was showin
We all said Fuck you bitch and kept goin
To the hood and we was fin to
Find somethin else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
A bum rush but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin at all
Ice Cubell go stupid when Im full of eight ball
I might stumble but still wont lose

Cause Im the type of nigga thats built to last
If you fuck with me Ill put my foot in your ass

1505,"A carved oak table
Tells a tale
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room
To arbours cool
A time of valour and legends born
A time when honour meant much more to a man than life
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong
Through lance and sword
Why why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander
It seems because through time and space
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore
A dusty table
Musty smells
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey
That scars the panes
Gone the carving
And those who left their mark
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway
And the weak must die according to natures law
As old as they
Why why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander
It seems because through time and space

Its all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe its true
Its a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
But you can take the crosstown bus
If its raining or its cold
And the animals will love it
If you do
If you do now
Something tells me
Its all happening at the zoo
I do believe it

The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but theyre dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum
Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas You gotta come and see
At the zoo

Until we read the Parthian skin
Broken fears warning days are here again
Fore we all to dust descend
Heaven knows when life will end
God to know in the mire put out the fire
Know there is a cross to bear
In your primal quest of fear
No quarter now is given no less
Aslumber was my main ideal
Asunder did my spirit steal
Sceptred race uttered words in disgrace
Sweet revenge will be ours
Vengeance of a shaken world
Just remember that patience is no sin
And to find another way
Live to breathe another day
Lord of light in the darkness our guide
In a tempest never shaken
Edge of doom is not mistaken
Countenance is not a sin
Gallant king we bow to him
Fierce as wolf with a leopard skin
Dark and bitter deep within

Sea of blood in light divine
Unholy reverence enjoyed
Intoxicated with their hell

Wilderness a tyrant dream
Sell your soul not give them power

Bound himself to oath and king
Such loyalty a shameless thing
Youth of agony still burn
Shedding parents blood
Never say a prayer to me
For this crime and treachery
Drinking from your cup of wisdom true
Many men will follow you
Now an army is raised
And our gods they be praised
Death is but a guilted edge
Shall no more than we will pledge
Hear the cry we are ready to believe
The prodigal has returned
Give us our own revenge
With the power he learned
We will burn the same again
A betrayal of angels in a foreign land
A revenge for the merciful destiny at hand
For all those who have written
In the sand will be told
That the same will happen searching for gold
Like a fire in the sky
I can feel strength return
Heading for afterlife meet me there

Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesnt come
This twisted tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Whos longing for some rest
And feeling numb
What do you expect of me
What is it you want
Whatever youve planned for me
Im not the one
A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And wont be satisfied
Wont be denied
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside
What am I supposed to do
When everything that Ive done
Is leading me to conclude
Im not the one
Whatever Ive done

Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game

Bring us round a bottle and well have some laughs

They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars

He drunk up all the rest that son of a bitch
His bloods bad whiskey I was raised on robbery

1412,"They say that these are not the best of times
But theyre the only times Ive ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lovers eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
Its either sadness or euphoria
So well argue and well compromise
And realize that nothings ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason coexists with our insanity
And though we choose between reality and madness
Its either sadness or euphoria
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we dont fulfill each others fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our respective similarities
Its either sadness or euphoria
Whoa whoa

1441,"Back back back with the boom so give a nigga room
Came with the fame with my name came a tune
The King of Rock there is none higher
God with Madonna not melodic like Mariah
Carey when Larry put me in his Caddy I made my album
I rock the funky beat like Marky Mark be rockin Calvin
Kleins no friend of mine I told you Pryor
Richard switch it all around now you admire
My Adidas was a hit in eightysix it made me dollars
Stompin straight through Compton niggas there was screamin HOLLIS
Back to the top youre bout to get dropped
Go for what you know or ride the bo and get stopped
My man Darryl Mack dressed in all black
I pass the mic to D and DMCll pass it back 
Rappers wont be dissin after this rap song
Cause they sing like Rodney King Cant we all just get along
Chorus
From a harder core Im kickin the raw
I wreck it on tour Im breakin your jaw
This is what RunDMCll be about yall
I make the party people want to scream and shout yall
Im just a bboy so watch me destroy
You best believe in youre receivin DMC boy
I used to explode I never let go
I let the tec go back because I said so
Yeah Im a hoodlum but Im a good one
So punks gunnin for my run I wish they would come
So back up Mr Softy cause youre not hard
Youre never comin off because I got God
Just  and get a beat down
Never weak kid I come up with more street sounds
Rhymes galore and soarin cross the floor an
Some more is pourin knockin down your door an
Chorus
Cmon and jump to the rhythm I give em is what I give em
When I get em I just hit em and split em
And when I split em lit em up like a bulb in the dark
I made you blink you figure out cause I know youre the mark
I gotta lotta what I gotta thatll be what I got
So step to me or DMC and itll be in your heart
Now ease up back off the bozack you know that you bite
You think youre doin me or D Nigga please what

At first I was afraid I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
Then I spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so youre back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second youd be back to bother me
Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause youre not welcome anymore
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbyes
You think Id crumble
You think Id lay down and die

And you see me somebody new
Im not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free

One little taste itll do
Maybe Ill take it and snooze then tear up the stage in a few

1705,"Well Im caught one more time
Up on Cyprus Avenue
Im caught one more time
Up on Cyprus Avenue
And Im conquered in a car seat
Not a thing that I can do
I may go crazy
Before that mansion on the hill
I may go crazy
Before that mansion on the hill
But my heart keeps beating faster
And my feet cant keep still
And all the little girls rhyme something
On the way back home from school
And all the little girls rhyme something
On the way back home from school
And the leaves fall one by one
And call the autumn time a fool
Yeah my ttongue gets tied
Every every every time I try to speak
My tongue gets tied
Every time I try to speak
And my inside shakes just like a leaf on a tree
I think Ill go walking by the railroad with my cherry cherry wine
I believe Ill go walking by the railroad with my cherry cherry wine
If I pass the rumbling station where the lonesome engine drivers pine
Wait a minute yonder come my lady
Rainbow ribbons in her hair
Yonder come my lady
Rainbow ribbons in her hair
Six white horses and a carriage
Shes returning from the fair
Baby baby baby
Well Im caught one more time
Up on Cyprus Avenue
Im caught one more time
Up on Cyprus Avenue
And Im conquered in a car seat
And Im looking straight at you
Way up on way up on way up on
The avenue of trees
Keep walking down
In the wind and the rain darling
You keep walking down when the sun shone through the trees
Nobody no no no no nobody stops me from loving you baby
So young and bold fourteenyear old
Baby baby baby
