I am a man who walks alone
And when Im walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when its dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When youre searching for the light
Sometimes when youre scared
To take a look at the corner of the room
Youve sensed that somethings watching you
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and noones there
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because youre sure theres someone there
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark

Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there

Arent you somethin to admire
Cause your shine is somethin like a mirror
And I cant help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that Im always
Parallel on the other side
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you theres no place we couldnt go
Just put your hand on the glass
Ill be there to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
Cause I dont wanna lose you now
Im lookin right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

971,"Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat acourtin
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below
I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly
My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his teardimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly

Cause when you rolled the dice
The house came down on you
Dont care what you do or say
Your suicide begins today

Shitty time to make a stand
All without a master plan just you

Dont try to hang you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
Ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting a size 10
First come first serve whoevers got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hiphop maniac
Brainiac so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think a rap will last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo be original your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and now beating the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo giving what I gotta give doing what I gotta do
You dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
You cant harm me alarm me
Cause were the generals in this fucking hiphop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didnt know
We blow flow and getting loose slow from the get go yo
Try us and take it
Yo fuck this shit Yella kick the break in
Its the real thing you are now real real niggas niggas
You can run but you cant hide you know Imma findcha
Cause a nigga like Rens only 2 steps behindcha
Dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on forget that the mics on
Dont step on my muthafucking stage without nikes on
Dont say its psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
All these niggas wit the jibber jabber
But couldnt kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because yo its the shit that we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But Imma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead
Black the good the bad the ugly you see
A little streetwise nigga you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hiphop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get
Trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
Since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
Cause Im a muthafucka thats out to kill
EazyE a nigga thats real
Real niggas straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked its my bullet you caught
So if youre talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats
They played out thats what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we aint having it
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
Yet so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes Ill come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money dont buy you a fucking crumb
Youre on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
Cause if I let you slide its just cause you lucked up
Dont come in my face again because Imma floor ya
And if youre a bitch Im a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitudes a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas
Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness but Dre is just a nigga that glad theres
Sucka muthafuckas like you making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When Im expressing stand still like youre full of rigor mortis
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess you figure
You can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
A nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play

Yo NWA criticize for what we say
But Im a do the shit anyway

As I walk through this wicked world
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself is all hope lost
Is there only pain and hatred and misery
And each time I feel like this inside
Theres one thing I wanna know
Whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
Oh whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
And as I walked on through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted
And where is the harmony
Sweet harmony
Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me want to cry

1916,"Cocaine Blues live LyricsEarly one mornin while makin the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin 44 beneath my head
Got up next mornin and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Laid in the hot joints takin the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
Youre the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Said yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If youve got a warrant just aread it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next mornin bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Up then he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said Come on you dirty hack into that district court
Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered Lawdy Lawdy have mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
99 years in the Folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground
I cant forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on youve gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

I didnt listen to his jive

I knew I was a genius

I knew that this was meant to be

Thats why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic didnt know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three but I was swinging
They all laugh at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry if they just couldnt understand
The idiomatic logic that went on in my head
I had a brain it was insane
Oh they used to laugh at me when I refused to ride
On all those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
But I said Dear doctor I think that its you instead
Because I Ive got a thing thats unique and new
To prove it Ill have the last laugh on you
Cause instead of one head I got two
And you know two heads are better than one

Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition
Keepin this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us

Even though we know somehow we all gotta go

Well be leavin with some kind of dough
So until that day we expire and turn to vapors

When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now its all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin years in the hundreds
I switched my motto instead of sayin Fuck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle couldve struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back

To get home and marry that baby of mine

Me to send for my Ebony Eyes

To my beautiful Ebony Eyes

The plane was way overdue
So I went inside to the airlines desk and I said
Sir I wonder why 1203 is so late
He said Oh they probably took off late
Or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course
I went back outside and waited at the gate
And I watched the beacon light from the control tower
As it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for 
My Ebony Eyes
And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker
Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203
Please report to the chapel across the street at once
Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my lifes most wonderful prize
My beautiful Ebony Eyes
If I ever get to heaven Ill bet
The first angel Ill recognise
Shell smile at me and I know she will be

When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin I could do or say to try to change it
Cause thats just the way she was
They said I cant rap about bein broke no more
They aint say I cant rap about coke no more Ahh 
Slut you think I wont choke no whore
Til them vocal cords dont work in her throat no more Ahh 
These motherfuckers are thinkin Im playing

Put your hands down bitchI aint gon shoot you
Ima pull you to this bullet and put it through you Ahh 
Shut up slut Youre causin too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slutokay Ma
Oh now hes rapin his own mother
Abusin a whore snortin coke
And we gave him the Rollin Stone cover
Youre goddamn right bitch and now its too late
Im triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin vrin vrin vrin
Texas Chainsaw left his brains all
Danglin from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood guts guns cuts
Knives lives wives nuns sluts

Girls neither you aint nothin but a slut to me

Bitch Ima kill you Like a murder weapon Ima conceal you
In a closet with mildew sheets pillows and film you
Fuck with me I been through Hell shut the hell up
Im tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell em
I aint acid rap but I rap on acid
Got a new blowup doll and just had a strapon added
Whoops Is that a subliminal hint
No just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend No Eminemll insult
And if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
To do it again then if he does it again
Youll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the tenth
Bitch Ima kill you I aint done this aint the chorus
I aint even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub but thats normal aint it Norman
Serial killer hidin murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again were out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours let us in

Cause Shady will fuckin kill you Ah haha 
I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady Why 
Cause Shady will fuckin kill you

Cause ladies screams keep creepin in Shadys dreams
And the way things seem I shouldnt have to pay these shrinks
These 80 Gs a week to say the same things tweece
Twice whatever I hate these things
Fuck shots I hope the weedll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with em cause their ratings stink
Fuck that Ill choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From inschool to before school to outta school
I dont even believe in breathing
Im leavin air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it
Okay Im ready to go play I got the machete from O J
Im ready to make everyones throats ache
You faggots keep eggin me on
Til I have you at knifepoint then you beg me to stop

Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls
And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the raindrenched streets
To England where my heart lies
My minds distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when youre asleep
And kiss you when you start your day
And a song I was writing is left undone
I dont know why I spend my time
Writing songs I cant believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme
And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you
And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I

I heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see

Heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
And Im alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes Im alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
I want someone who like the champagne I like my aalike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live she aint afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs natural medicine she cookin good
She tell me everything is cool when it aint lookin good
For real the world so ill yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as theres no selfishness
Yes as long as her love for the people is deeprooted and evident
You can be easily recruited youre heavensent
Your smile put me at ease
Youre the woman I need but where is she

And Im alone and I realize that when I get home

Yes Im alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyles perception
Invade my personal life Out of the question
What are they expectin
I be tryin to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever Im rollin in dough swimmin in a pool of cash
God wouldnt they know or am I a fool to ask
Im well known got people comin at me mad
I had to tell homes I dont keep a cell phone my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head the curse of the talented
Strong communicator vagabond
Id gallivant around the Equator if that would get me off the radar
Its so intense Im on my Lilo Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime what is this
An immaculate version of Me My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me

The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows
His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon
Now from the tunnels stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows
And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand
Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single worded poem comprised
Of four letters
And his heart is laughing screaming pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night

When I say Ima do somethin I do it I dont give a damn what you think
Im doin this for me so fuck the world
Feed it beans its gassed up if it thinks its stoppin me
Ima be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtably
And all those who look down on me Im tearin down your balcony
No ifs ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album hes
Still shittin whether hes on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first for better or worse
Hes married to the game

Forget the Earth hes got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brandnew me
You helped see me through
And dont even realize what you did cause believe me you
Ive been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on I promise
To focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldnt lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

214,"Real Niggaz New Version Lyrics a different version than all previous releases
Every motherfucker always asks how did NWA get started
We dont know how it got started
Fuck that question you know what Im saying
Its the same bullshit over and over
How did we get started
How did we first meet
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo you shouldve covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you was a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker
Dont try to hang you best avoid it
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemrroids
Before you try to fuck with Ren
Ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting the size 10
First come first serve whoevers got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the world of the motherfucking HipHop maniac
Brainiac so what you ought to do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think your rap would last
With your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo be original your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you motherfucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums for many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles
Cheating and not beating the crowd are kept seating
But weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
And got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo giving what I gotta give doing what I gotta do
You dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
You cant harm me alarm me
Cause were the generals in this fucking HipHop army
The niggas with attitudes if you didnt know
We blow flow and then move slow from the get Go
Yo tie us to take it
Yo fuck this shit Yella kick the break in
Its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
You can run but you cant hide you know Im a find you
Cause a nigga like Ren is only two steps behind you
Dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep with the lights on forget that the Mics on
Dont step on my motherfucking stage without Nikes on
Dont say its psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
All these niggas with the gibber gabber
But couldnt kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer
Gangsters in black are out there
But only because yo its the shit that we wear
On my motherfucking dick
But Ima love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
So yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
Youll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead
Black the good the bad the ugly you see
A little street wise nigga you know me
Rolling with some real niggas playing for keeps
But you motherfuckers know who run the streets
With that hardcore HipHop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get
Trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
Since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
Cause Im the motherfucker thats out to kill
EazyE a nigga thats real
Timed bomb count down 
Real niggas straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without a second thought
And if your ass get smoked its my bullet you caught
So if youre talking shit about the niggas in black Explosion 
Bow down to the Kings and Raider hats
They played out thats what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we aint happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
Yet so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes Ill come like a fucking bump
Asking for fucking money dont buy you a fucking crumb
Youre on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
Because if I let you slide its just cause you lucked up
Dont come in my face again because Im a floor you
And if youre a bitch Ima fucking ignore you
Because my attitude is a little bigger
Cause MC Ren is one of the Real Niggas
Lost in a motherfucking world of madness
Sadness but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucking motherfuckers like you making whack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When Im expressing standstill like youre full of Rigor Mortis
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess you figure
You can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
A nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out with too much cargo
So Im glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo NWA criticized for what we say
But Ima do the shit anyway
Cause Im the motherfucking doctor never faking
Yo Yella kick the motherfucking break in
Its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
Yeah motherfucker its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
NWA Straight Outta motherfucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990s
Yo Dr Dre DJ Yella EazyE and I am MC Ren
Yo NWA taking over this motherfucker yall

It started back in highschool
So cool king of the scene
You found that making people laugh
Was more than just a dream
The public took right to you

So funny and smart so talented
But success just couldnt fit
Wasting your life
No future is bright

Helps you dig your daily ditch
The bottom line cant touch you
Cause youre above the rest

And with no place to hide I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

Its the same routine of getting up every morning
And putting on a smile
But underneath theres another person
Who cant find a reason to make living worthwhile
Ah another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and like having you
Ill never get used to
Ive gotten used to not listing
For familiar sounds you used to make
Now Im trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake
Look here its like a childs first step
I have to learn to walk all all over again
Cause you were always there if I should fall
And now theres nobody else that I can call
Its like wanting you and not having you
Ill never get used to
Lost in a cloud
I think I caught a glimpse of you
Blindly I rush to touch your hand huh
To discover its my mind
Playing tricks on me again Tricks on me again

1771,"This is dedicated to my girls
At first I was afraid I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
Then I spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so youre back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second youd be back to bother me
Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause youre not welcome anymore
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbyes
You think Id crumble
You think Id lay down and die

Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high
And you see me somebody new
Im not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now Im saving all my loving for someone whos loving me

How many Tulsas have been burnt down
And once Central Park was a thrivin black town
Yo Chuck Im fightin the power right now
Thanks to you Flav and PE puttin it down
Puttin your life on the line so I could rap now
The next generation still singin Fight the Power
Fight the power Fight the power

When they give us short sticks but we really need a long
To the boys in the hood duckin bullets and batons
From boys in the hood triple Ks on they arm
Four fingers on my palm screamin Fight
Change the policy before I buy back our property
You love Black Panther but not Fred Hampton
Word to the Howards and the Aggies and the Hamptons
They book us wont book us Im Booker
T Washington George killed for twenty

The value of black life the cost of goin to Wendys
For a fourquarter burger ended in murder

Yo solidarity is what Im wearin all black for
For comrades who done fought without me
Its not to try and change yall thoughts about me
Or to redirect your reports about me
Dear white people you should take a course about me
Cause is it the long dingaling Fourfinger ring
The sciences and the arts the songs we can sing
I really wanna know why yall so scared
Prolly cause the promised land we almost there
But look I think of images that fuel my youth
Been influenced by Craig Hodges and AbdulRauf
Examples like Olympic Black Power salutes
To Panther troops I saw as I pursued my truth
If racism is the cancer Black Thoughts the answer
Gotta get up off the back porch emancipate your minds
Get your bodies back from ransom Cmon 
And all black hands up for the anthem
Fight the power Fight the power 
Fight the power we got to fight the powers that be
Yo yo check this out man
Bring that beat back man Bring that beat back 
In two three four hit it
People people stronger than this evil
Smashin your power structure melanin royal regal
System designed to kill and unprotect
Worldwide hit the streets just to get some respect
Our fight and our rights for freedom will never waver
But justice Breonna Taylor salute Chuck and Flava
Feel the same anger since Radio Raheem died
Black power to the people push forward pride
Fight power like its the opp though
Born to fight I made it off the block though
Thought he had a gun and he was black thats the combo
The police killed George havin a convo George 
They killed Malcolm X they killed Doctor King Doctor King 
They gave us guns and dope they wanna stop our kings
They tryna erase our history stop and think
History class aint tell us bout Juneteeth
Cops dont give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a negro hes a hero
Fuck livin life on welfare
The last one who cared was Obamacare
Round twelve nose kinda bloody gotta keep fightin
Trump flew to North Korea they respect violence
If you aint tryna have your city on fire
Put some respect on our name we come from gold and diamonds
Fight the power Fight the power 
Fight the power we got to fight the powers that be
Yo yo
Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight up racist that sucker was simple and plain

The night came down jungle sounds were in my ears
City screams are all Ive heard in twenty years
The razor edge of night it cuts into my sleep
I sit upon the edge now shall I make that leap

The echo makes me turn to see that last frontier
The edge of time closes down as I disappear

Id find peace in every way
But in search for the clue
Wrong things I was bound to do
Keep my head to the sky
For the clouds to tell me why
As I grew and with strength
Master kept me as I repent
And he said
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky
He gave me the will to be free
Purpose to live His reality
Hey and I found myself never alone
Chances came to make me strong
To step right up and be a man
Cause you need faith to understand
So were saying for you to hear
Keep your head in faiths atmosphere
Keep your head to the sky
So the clouds
Keep your head to the sky
So they can tell you why Lord

I was told to love you
I was told to try

The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart

He investigates her and silently baits her sighs
He probes with his fingers but knows her heart only through his stethoscope

He provides consolation and he hears her confession at any time

4581,"Lady B Goode Lyrics
It was down in Louisiana right there in New Orleans
Back there in the 60s was a little teen queen
Fell then the lassie in love with a lad
Till it took him to vindicate take the feelings she had
She pleaded as she promised every prayer she could
Till everybody whispered to her Lady B Goode
She followed him around where he would play his guitar
Till he got so popular they made him a star
Then she could only see him on a TV screen
And hoped someday that hed come back to New Orleans
Everybody liked her and was knocking on wood
But soon there came a baby from the Lady B Goode
She wondered if hes ever coming back someday
The brighter lights and glory may just keep him away
But then he wrote and told her Do not be dismayed
The love you have for me will never be betrayed
They want me do a movie about my livelihood
And I want you to play the part of Lady B Goode
She went to see the movie when it hit the screen
Babysitting Johnnie Jr down in New Orleans
He saw his daddy sing the song he heard in school
The one his mother told him about the golden rule
Tears filled her eyes when they misunderstood
When everybody knew that she was Lady B Goode

But Im sure theres an explanation
Maybe its the way you carry yourself
Or maybe its your conversation

And hit rock bottom soon to be forgotten

I need you to help me convince myself ohohoh I love you 
That besides me theres noone else ohohoh I love you

Tell me that Ive changed that Im acting kinda strange
But they dont realise that since I met you

You make me feel kinda insecure
Cause my heart I can no longer control
And youve got me knocking jumping and stopping
Dont know which way Im supposed to go
My heart is all tied up in knots ohohoh I love you

The regular crowd shuffles in
Theres an old man sittin next to me
Makin love to his tonic and gin
He says Son can you play me a memory

But its sad and its sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger mans clothes

Sing us a song youre the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well were all in the mood for a melody
And youve got us feeling alright
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And hes quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But theres someplace that hed rather be
He says Bill I believe this is killing me
As the smile ran away from his face
Well Im sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place
Oh la lala dideeda

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And hes talkin with Davy whos still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes theyre sharing a drink they call loneliness
But its better than drinkin alone
Sing us a song youre the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well were all in the mood for a melody
And youve got us feeling alright
Its a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
Cause he knows that its me theyve been comin to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say Man what are you doin here

I mean you motherfuckers dont realize
How real this shit is man
I mean people always gonna try and get over on you
But protect whats yours protect your family
Protect whats right You hear me 
This story starts off
Little boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does its back to the ghetto ghetto 
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto so he adapts to the ghetto
Yes the crack and the metal
He takes no days off for gettin his cocaine off off 
He ran back and fourth so much it pissed Jose off Psssss 
Now Jose was the cocaine boss boss 
Straight from Columbia his cocaine soft soft 
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off cuz he had love for his sister Take that Take that 
And shorty had no love for his sister
Cuz his sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for em both
Plus he was good at handlin coke so Jose liked him
Problem was he was pitchin for the dudes down the street Who 
You know TJ Big Boo and Malik Word 
Malik is a killer Boo is a killer Yep 
TJ well hes just another nigga
But despite the fact what they didnt like the fact
That he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And being that he was a pitcher here in the winter air What happened 
They set it up to get him there and hit him there Damn 
But shorty was smart
So before they got to load and spark
He said hold up my heart Hold up hold up Please
Then he said please look up in my bag Look 
Theres cook up in my bag its all good up in my bag Here 
And theres more where that came from
I get it from Jose believe me theres more where that came from
Yeah he had em lost and the game won won 
They let him go yeah thinkin he would let em know What 
Where Jose was keepin that heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that Bout that 
And we all know Jose bout that Bout that 
Next thing you know he seen Jose slouch back What 
In the chair like Theres no way out that Nope 
He said Shoot em Imma blow they house back Back 
Next day he sent the two way out town And 
And somebody blew they house down Damn 
Jose think shorty on his side
But he dont know shorty on his side Word 
So shorty called Jose like Listen Listen 
Its going down I need more cocaine Bring it 
So we met up Met up it was a set up
Guess who TJ Malik and Boo sped up Wow 
You shouldve seen the look on Joses face
You never seen the look on old mans face Nope 
Told him no mans great
And its no mans place to fuck wit no mans fam
Then he said Wheres my sister fore I kill you
The End
The storys over man Its over man 
They all kinda end like that sometime too Ya dig 
Ya see I told the story cuz man I kinda feel like
Every hood everybody
Everybody got a Lil Boy Fresh around them somewhere
Whether its right next door across the hall
Up the block down the block around the corner
Huh I mean ya see
Ya see we all see the same shit Just through
Different eyes
You surprised Dont be man
Its just real shit

Runnin fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Youre all Ive ever needed
Baby youre the one
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel oh
For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

942,"You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman Lyrics
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
And youre the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman 
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didnt know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now Im no longer doubtful of what Im living for
And if I make you happy I dont need to do more
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman 
Oh baby what youve done to me What youve done to me 
You made me feel so good inside Good inside 
And I just wanna be Wanna be

They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away

They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can

Well its the MIcrooked letter aint no one better
And when Im on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
Cause Im cooler than a polar bears toenails
Oh hell there he go again talking that shit
Bend corners like I was a curve I struck a nerve
And now you bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard its not where youre from but where you pay rent
Then I heard its not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows amongst other things but Im not worried
Cause when we step up in the party like a mouse you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax BIG BOI
Its that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try to warn you not to test but you dont listen
Giving the shoutout to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
Now my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender aint nothing better
Let me know when its wet enough to enter
If not Ill wait because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone
Or will it feel that if we tune it it just might get picked on
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone
They alienateus cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach aint no lie
Ill be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker breaker 104 can I get some reply
Now everybody say

Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like ES to the PN cause we adjust to the beat in the zone zone 
Honey Im home but Im not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now Im sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team and like your daddys wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens so back the hell up off me
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The worlds a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so Im ready for war okay

Ah You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
Youve taken all my money and you want more
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrowminded cronies
Who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs
Youre tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Killjoy bad guy
Big talking small fry
Youre just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me
Can you face me
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good Are you satisfied
Do you feel like suicide I think you should 
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night
Do you feel good Feel good 
Ah Talk like a big business tycoon
Youre just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
Youre just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
Dog with disease
Youre the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is
Mr KnowAll was the fin on your back part of the deal
Shark
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart You never did 
Of your own Right from the start 
Insane should be put inside
Youre a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good I feel good

3536,"My name is Joe Roberts I work for the state
Im a sergeant out of Perrineville Barracks Number 8
I always done an honest jobas honest as I could
I got a brother named Frankie and Frankie aint no good
Now ever since we was young kids its been the same comedown
I get a call on the shortwave Frankies in trouble downtown
Well if it was any other man Id put him straight away
But when its your brother sometimes you look the other way
Me and Frankie laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when hes straying
Like any brother would
A man turns his back on his family
Well he just aint no good
Well Frankie went in the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment settled down took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping till it was like we were getting robbed
Frankie came home in 68 and me I took this job
Yeah were laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when hes straying
Teach him how to walk that line
A man turns his back on his family
He aint no friend of mine
Well the night was like any other I got a call bout quarter to nine
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid lying on the floor looking bad bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table and it was Frank they said
Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights
Well I mustve done a hundred and ten through Michigan County that night
It was out at the crossroads down round Willow Bank
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank
Well I chased him through them county roads
Till a sign said Canadian border five miles from here
I pulled over on the side of the highway
And watched his taillights disappear
Me and Frankie laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria

You were playin on the horses you were playin on the guitar strings
You were playin like a devil wearin wings
Wearin wings you looked so grand wearin wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly I heard you can can you fly
Like an eagle doin your huntin from the sky
I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheatin once or twice
Once or twice I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wondrin was the gamble worth the price
Pack it in I heard you did pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win
So lately youve been hidin it was somewhere in the news
And Im still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like Ive been workin overtime
Over time Ive lost my fire over time
Always playin one more hand for one more dime
Slowin down Im gettin tired slowin down
And I envy you the valley that youve found
Cause Im midway down the midway
Slowin down
Down down down

Im wonderin if thats her hair I remember
Stickball humpin hoochies on the wall
Or takin leaks on the steps stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryna stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights tryna keep it true

Once I was a tumbling weed
Like a rolling stone cold and all alone
Living for the day my train would come
I never cared for school or any golden rules
Papa used to always say I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show them they was wrong
And headed out on the road singing my song
Then one sunny day The man he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of it was real
Money girls and cars and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so papa would see
When I went home to show em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
Oh such a sad song
First I got lost then I got found
But the ones that I love are in the ground
Papa I only wish you could see me now
Take a listen papa
Whoo I learnt how to play my guitar
Gonna be a superstar

The ones I love are in the ground
Wont you tell me please was I right or wrong

991,"Down on Cyprus Avenue
With a childlike vision leaping into view
Clicking clacking of the highheeled shoe
Ford and Fitzroy Madame George
Marching with the soldier boy behind
Hes much older now with hat on drinking wine
And that smell of sweet perfume comes drifting through
The cool night air like Shalimar
And outside theyre making all the stops
The kids out in the street collecting bottletops
Gone for cigarettes and matches in the shops
Happy taken Madame George
Thats when you fall
Whoa thats when you fall
Yeah thats when you fall
When you fall into a trance
Sitting on a sofa playing games of chance
With your folded arms and history books
You glance into the eyes of Madame George
And you think you found the bag
Youre getting weaker and your knees begin to sag
In the corner playing dominoes in drag
The one and only Madame George
And then from outside the frosty window raps
She jumps up and says Lord have mercy I think that its the cops
And immediately drops everything she gots
Down into the street below
And you know you gotta go
On that train from Dublin up to Sandy Row
Throwing pennies at the bridges down below
And the rain hail sleet and snow
Say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
And as you leave the room is filled with music
Laughing music dancing music all around the room
And all the little boys come around walking away from it all
So cold and as youre about to leave
She jumps up and says hey love you forgot your gloves
And the loves to love to love the love
To say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
Dry your eyes for Madame George
Say goodbye in the wind and the rain on the back street

Then I think it wouldve showed

Who hold a gun that fires Cost
And people die from being old
Or left alone because theyre cold
And bombs are dropped on fighting cats
And childrens dreams are run with rats
If you complain you disappear
Just like the lesbians and queers
Noone can love without the grace
Of some unseen and distant face
And you get beaten up by blacks
Who though they worked still got the sack
And when your soul tells you to hide
Your very right to die is denied
And in the battle on the streets
You fight computers and receipts
And when a man is trying to change
It only causes further pain
You realize that all along
Something in us going wrong
You stop dancing

When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh ooh and shes buying a stairway to Heaven

Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook theres a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh it makes me wonder

Theres a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh it makes me wonder
Ooh really makes me wonder
And its whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Its just a spring clean for the May queen

Theres still time to change the road youre on

The pipers calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all

398,"Ive been around and Ive seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People living like Superman
All day and all night
And I wont say if its wrong or if its right
Im pretty fast myself
But I do have some advice to pass along
Right here in the words of this song
Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you dont look down
An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl have lived in love and for love
And over love and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupids bow that had
Passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like
A porcupine and she asked me
BB do you think Ive lived my life all wrong
And I said The only advice I have to pass
Along is concealed in the chorus of this song
Girl
Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you dont look down
I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning
In London England
And there was a very large Rolls Royce Limousine
Pulling slowly along the street
And in that Rolls Royce was the Queen of England
Looking tired
Just go back from a party and the Queen leaned out and
She said Arent you BB King She said
Oh BB sometimes its so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think I ought to do
And I said
You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you dont look down
You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead

159,"Once again this is it
Turn it up here we go
But this time the rhymes
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then lets get down to the nittygritty
I wanna know who
Picked Wilsons pocket
After he rocked it
Fact he shocked it
Same kinda thing they threw at James Brown 
And what they did to Redd was a shame
The bigger the Blacks get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that booty
Intentional Rape System like we aint
Paid enough in this bitch thats why I dissed them
I learned we earned got no concern
Instead we burned where the hell is our return
Plain and simp the systems a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho who stole the soul
Aint no different than in South Africa
Over here theyll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo they say the Black dont know how to act Who me 
Cause were waitin for the big payback
But we know itll never come
Thats why I say come and get some
Why when the Black moves in Jack moves out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Aint we all people
How the hell can a color be no good to a neighborhood
Help straighten me out
Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
Sayin Im wrong for singin a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
Try to be the best and
Let everybody know before I blow
Cuz I wanna know what sucka stole the soul
We choose to use their ways
And holidays notice some of them are heller days
Invented by those that never repented
For the sins within that killed my kin
But thats all right
I try do what a brother does
But Ill never know if youre my cuz
Thats why I try my best to unite
Damn the rest if they dont like it
Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
Has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him
40 acres and a mule Jack
Where is it whyd you try to fool the Black
It wasnt you but you pledge allegiance
To the red white and blue
Suckers that stole the soul

He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy

I was walking in he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was
Glory days well theyll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye
Glory days glory days
Well theres a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boys heads
Sometimes on a Friday Ill stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess its two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking bout

And they let him go
Now everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that hes too old

At the Metuchen Ford plant assembly line

But I can tell whats on his mind
Glory days yeah goin back
Glory days aw he aint never had

I think Im going down to the well tonight
Im gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I dont sit around thinking about it
But I probably will

You thought you had it planned you thought you had your man
He saw you coming he ran when you tried to blast that man
Missed him by inches he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of em pull through but one didnt sons finished
You took the life of him
The part about it thats crazy you was aight with him
Tight with him why was he in the way
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day
His style never hollas loud stays reclusive
Good dude got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days

But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
Im mashin the gas shes grabbin the wheel its trippy
How hard she rides with me the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we dont speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the shows over
Shes right back to being my soldier
Cause mamis a rider and Im a roller
Put us together how they gon stop both us
Whatever she lacks Im right over her shoulder
When Im off track mami is keepin me focused
So lets lock this down like its supposed to be
The 03 Bonnie and Clyde Hov and B holla
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend 
The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
That aint bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin
It wont be that oh no it wont be that
I dont be at places where we comfy at
With no beatch oh no you wont see that
And no I aint perfect
Nobody walkin this earths surface is
But girlfriend work with the kid
I keep you workin that Herms Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs Aviator lens
Six hundred drops hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I dont have to worry only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So dont let the necessary occur yep
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend 
Talk to em B If I was your girlfriend
Ill be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me Thats right 
Yeahhee Break it down for em B 
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise Ill give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend One more time 
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in all that I believe in
I promise Ill give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
Twas then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden

I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors

Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray
Ill go bring your darling baby to your side

She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died

They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain

The official DJ rapper name is DJ Run
All other sucker rappers boy youre just my son
All wet behind the ears I freeze I froze youre numb
PUMP PUMP I scream on you you talk and talk
PUMP PUMP Run you round the track then walk it off
So check for me take in a weapon and even steppin
To my foes even those of Joes are always kept in
Seperate rows broken nose from blows ruin your rep
When I pounce all my foes suppose I swing the ep
And just BOUNCE

Everybody just BOUNCE cut by Jay 3X 
My name is DMC the one you know

And spread a funky rhythm all across the land
I blow your mind the rhymell flow
I hit you with the rhythm and they give me dough
Im one of a kind I rock your mind
Im stingy with the digits when I rock my rhyme
I bust a vein inside my brain
I came with the name and I claim the fame
Im hard to the core wicked and raw
The rhymes break raw when Im breakin your door
I kick a ill style cause Im stickastill wild
Takea takea chill now cause I got to kill a foul
Foulmouthed sucker knockin out all doubt
Im takin suckers out cause I make a sucker bounce
This is the way the way the way 8X

Theres no sign of my mind slippin off the line
And if you find theres a dime I left behind
I come fast for my cash I must rewind
Easy does it Runll do it speakin fluid vocabulary
Vocal we makin em come to it then I have you very
Often lost in Runll run a boss then
Confuse you lose youre all lost up in the sauce
Then I stir you sir youre all shakin cause Im diesel
Drop hiphop and then POP goes the weasel
Comin and runnin and seekin daily for my kingdom
Takin my lyrics at first they hear it then they sing them
I take a sucker and do em the heads I flew em

Life lies in a grave
Silent death rides high above
On the wings of revelation
Multideath from chemicals

Annihilation must be swift
Destroy without destruction
Gods of the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the land where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
Chemical warfare
Artificial fucking peace
Line up in death row
Generals in their slow defeats
Diminish from this hell
Banished from the dying world

The deadly gas that brings them to their knees
Sacrifice
Steal the soul and send his corpse to hell
Mummified regions lying in dust
Fall victim to this game
Petrified corpses bathing in rust
Taken without being blamed
Falsified spirits farther they fall
Soon they will join us in hell

I hated the moonlight
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling
Seemed flat as the moonlight
With no one to stay up for I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heard somebody whisper Please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Rang our number all night long
Its no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said You moved away
And left me all your bills to pay
Look out baby you might have made your move too soon
Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure aint hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you aint living here no more
Its too bad
I think you made your move too soon

From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news

In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island
Ive built walls
A fortress steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
Its laughter and its loving I disdain

And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb

Cant clean my act up for good too much thug in him nah 
Probably end up back in the hood like Fuck it then
Huddlin over the oven we was like brothers then what 
Though you was nothin other than a son of my mothers friend
We had covenant who wouldve thought the love would end
Like Ice Colds album uhh all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all woodgrain all good brain
We wouldnt bicker like the other fools talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign could bring
Should blame the game and I could
Its kill or be killed how could I refrain
And forever be in debt and thats never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it it just aint the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things like cars jewelry and Miss Thing
Jealousy ego and pride and this brings
It all to a head like a coin chaching
The root of evil strikes again this could sting

This puts the ring in jeopardy indefinitely

Pitch sling pies and niggas they sing Why uhh 
Guess they aint strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin follow the street signs
Im standing on the roof of my building
Im feelin the whirlwind of beef I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin 80 proof bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good that form street politics
Makes a sweet honest kid turn illegal for commerce uhh 
To get his feet out of them Converse thats my word

1852,"The redheaded stranger from Blue Rock Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The redheaded stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait til tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
A yellowhaired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
The yellowhaired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didnt seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait til tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
The yellowhaired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free of course
For you cant hang a man for killing a woman
Whos trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And dont lay a hand on the bay
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again

Hed play all day for me
Play me a song

The star
That gives us light
Has been gone a while
But its not an illusion
The ache
In my heart
Is so much a part
Of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years a thousand years
Hold me close
Hold me close and dont let me go
Hold me close
Like Im someone that you might know
Hold me close
The darkness just lets us see
Who we are
Ive got your light inside of me

Once we are born we begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
Im sure Ive met
Long before the night the stars went out
Were meeting up again

Hold me close

The stars are bright but do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold
You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Dont fear the world it isnt there
Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me
Iris
Iris
She says
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see yourself
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see

Not in the die way

Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I fucked no bloke

Then I knew he was not lying Lying 
I heard telephones opera house favourite melodies
I saw boys toys electric irons and TVs

I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat skinny people
And all the tall short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people

Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadnt have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them

Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that

Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Dont think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor

224,"Hey life look at me
I can see the reality
Cause when you shook me took me out of my world
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
Cause when you got a tender love

Then you better beware of the happening
One day youre up then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you
I was sure I felt secure
Until love took a detour
Yeah riding high on top of the world
It happened suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you the happening

For certain suddenly I started hurting
I saw the light too late
When that fickle finger of fate

I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didnt last
Now Romeo you know I cant believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right next time
Thats the end of me

If you still need her
Then be on your way
Dont want to hear about Susan
Shes got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
No no no no no get it right

Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same
Now Romeo you know I never knew

Its over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waited and I waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline
I was down and I fell I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever cause nothing lasts
Dancing with the bones of my buried past
Never mind theres nothing I could do
Bet your life theres something killing you
Its a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go but have no fear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
Im finished Im getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats this fast
Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure but the pleasures been mine all mine

Im a social disease
Ive come for your wealth
Leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry

If you shake my hand
Better count your fingers
What if I do get caught
What if there is no judgement
If Im right I lose nothing
If youre right I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because Im doing something wicked
Im guilty haunted by my fears
And the only consequences are dread and the fugitive mind
You built walls to protect you
So noone will infect you
Pursued by those out there

Its a yearnin for my own back yard
I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride
Going home running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home and Im running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born
When the weathers better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind dont whistle round my knees
Ill put on my weddin suit and catch the evening train
Ill be home before the milks upon the door
Going home running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home and Im running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born
But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
Id be singing in my alley if I could
And if Im called away and its my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor Ill be asking of you
Dont bury me here its too cold
Take me back carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back wont you carry me home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from

678,"I was driving across the burning desert when I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens it was the strings of my guitar
Amelia it was just a false alarm
The drone of flying engines is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue of picture postcard charms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
People will tell you where theyve gone theyll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise others just come to harm
Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm
I wish that he was here tonight its so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt as the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm
A ghost of aviation she was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending on beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
Maybe Ive never really loved I guess that is the truth
Ive spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel to shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia dreams and false alarms

A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough euphorias high
More borrowed money more borrowed time
Backed in a corner caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Natures scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries loss of all pride
To leave aint believin so try and be tried
Insufficient funds insanity and suicide
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
The Congress will push me to raise taxes and Ill say no read my lips read my lips read my lips read my lips read my lips
Now with new hope some will be proud
This is no hoax no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed no dividend
Some may ask Why
Youll find the solution
The answers in the sky
Rise so high yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough euphorias high
More borrowed money more borrowed time
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Foreclosure of a dream

Until all is lost personal holocaust

500,"The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
Here are we one magical moment
Such is the stuff from where dreams are woven
Bending sound dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you drive like a demon
From station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love
Wonder who wonder who wonder when
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink drink drain your glass raise your glass high
Its not the sideeffects of the cocaine
Im thinking that it must be love
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful

I must be only one in a million

Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time
So gold
Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever
And be in time
Stay gold
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
Oh gold

And thats a fact yall
And if you try to take whats mine Ill take it back yall
Its like that
Lickylickylickylickylickylickylickylicky
Listen party people heres a serious song
Its right not wrong I should say right on
I gotta tell you somethin that you all should know
Its not a mystery its history and heres how it go
Now Harriet Tubman was born a slave
She was a tiny Black woman but she was brave
She was livin to be givin theres a lot that she gave
Theres not a slave in this day and age Im proud to be
Black goddamn Im tired my man
Dont worry bout what color I am
Because Ill show you how ill this man can act
It could never be fiction cause it is all fact
And if you get in my way I will not turn back
Im proud of my name my name is Darryl Mack
Im Black and Im proud and Ill say it out loud
Ill share my story with the whole crowd uh
You know Im proud to be Black yall
And thats a fact yall
And if you try to take whats mine Ill take it back yall
Its like that
DJ Run and Im running things
You can hear it loud and clear like when the school bell rings
Like Martin Luther King I will do my thing
Ill say it in a rap cause I do not sing
DMC the man thats causin the grief
I got a message for the world so listen up its brief
Like Malcolm X said I wont turn the right cheek
Got the strength to go the length if you wanna start beef start beef
You know Im proud to be Black yall
And real brave yall
And motherfucker I could never be a slave yall
So take that
Gonna tell ya somethin put your mind in a swirl
God bless the next baby that comes in this world
The worlds full of hate discrimination and sin
People judgin other people by the color of skin
Ill attack this matter in my own way
Man I aint no slave I aint bailin no hay
Written a deposition in any condition
Dont get in my way cause Im full of ambition
Im proud to be Black and I aint takin no crap
Im fresh out the pack and Im proud to be Black so take that
There was a man an inventor who invented so well
He invented a fortune for a man named Bell
George Washington Carver made the peanut great
Showed any man with a mind could create
You read about Malcolm X in the history text
Jesse Owens broke records Ali broke necks
Whats wrong with ya man How can you be so dumb
Like Dr King said We shall overcome

The most incredible baby
Uh
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Yeah yeah
Uh
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Good dude I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel firstclass to change the forecast
Never in bunches just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
Its been months since I checked back in
Were somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain four and change Armor Alld down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I cant let you know it pride wont let me show it
Pretend to be heroic thats just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry uh
Cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
On repeat the CD of Bigs Me My Bitch
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin Let me see that clip
Shopping sprees pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
Thats when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine I dont know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick let me see thats it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldnt touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbedout buggy
And then they got fuzzy and they dont remember that
And I dont remember you
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah I seen em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
A face of stone was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then
You have given away without gettin at me
Thats your fault how many times you forgiven me
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me
I know the way a nigga livin was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Shit Im a man with pride you dont do shit like that
You dont just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You dont throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin them girls I was gon get right back
They say you cant turn a bad girl good
But once a good girls gone bad shes gone forever
Ill mourn forever
Shit Ive got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know I seen em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes

1082,"He Got Game Album Version Lyrics
Yeah thats right this cut goes out to all yall thats been missin us for mad years
One love yall
Yeah thats right He Got Game
PE 1998
If man is the father the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe then why
Is this verse comin six times rehearsed
Dont freestyle much but I write em like such Word 
Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens
What does it all mean all this shit Im seein
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Signs of a local nigga unravelling uh huh 
My wanderin got my ass wondering
Where Christ is in all this crisis
Hatin Satan never knew what nice is
Check the papers while I bet on ices
More than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres prayers laced with fear
Beware two triple O is near
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin
But damn the game if it dont mean nothin
What is game Who got game
Wheres the game in life behind the game behind the game
I got game shes got game
We got game they got game he got game
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin
But fuck the game if it aint sayin nothin
Damn was it something I said
Pretend you dont see so you turn your head
Ray scared of his shadow does it matter
Thought of reparations got em playin with the population
Nothin to lose everythings approved
People used even murders excused You preach to em yo 
White men in suits dont have to jump
Still a thousand and one ways to lose with his shoes
God takes care of old folks and fools
While the devil takes care of makin all the rules
Folks dont even own themselves
Payin mental rent to corporate presidents My man my man 
Ugh one outta million residents
Bein dissident who aint kissin it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sick missin chips and all the championships
Whats Love Got To Do with what you got
Dont let a win get to your head or a loss to your heart Word 
Nonsense perseveres prayers laced with fear
Beware two triple O is near
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin
But damn the game if it dont mean nothin
What is game Who got game
Wheres the game in life behind the game behind the game
I got game shes got game
We got game they got game he got game
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin

And a new world order is about to begin yknowhutImsayin
Now the question is are you ready for the real revolution
Which is the evolution of the mind
If you seek then you shall find that we all come from the divine
You dig what Im sayin
Now if you take heed to the words of wisdom
That are written on the walls of life
Then universally we will stand and divided we will fall
Because love conquers all you understand what Im sayin
This is a call to all you sleepin souls
Wake up and take control of your own cipher
And be on the lookout for the spirit snipers
Tryin to steal your light yknowhutImsayin
Look withinside yourself for peace
Give thanks live life and release
You dig me You got me

But thats not me
I wanted to show how independent Id grown now
But thats not me
I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl
Im a little bit scared cause I havent been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time
My folks when I wrote them told em what I was up to
Said thats not me
I went through all kinds of changes took a look at myself
And said thats not me
I miss my pad and the places Ive known
And every night as I lay there alone
I would dream
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasnt so pretty

Bodies lay lifeless like dolls
A moment that felt like days
Lives extinguished in a rage
So nauseous I dont realize
Incessantly feeding the flies
In the moment of visceral haze

The last thing you see are my eyes
Fear lies beneath your facade
In panic you scream for your god
No way Ill ever abstain
Blood falls from the ceiling like rain
Patiently unleash my violence
Ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
In darkness this feeling I love
To be covered in blood blood from above
This violence finally sets me free
Brings demons back to torture me
Theres no god pulling at my strings
Im above all sorrow faith can bring
Disengaged I see your face
An adrenaline rush I cant replace
Hands around your neck your senses numb
Staring into your eyes when the stillness comes

But he also got a righteous cause for sinning

Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord you said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping Brown Sugar by DAngelo
In Los Angeles like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe being good Catholics Im coming

The more you gon need memorial services

Devils pie save some dessert for us

I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They wont be happy til somebody die

Fore Im locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems its alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
Let me get serious for yall one second 
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bobs killer
Asking him why as my eyes fill up
These days I cant wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten homes I still feel ya
So curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are Bobalob
Lord forgive him we all have sinned
But Bobs a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning thanks again

2242,"The sound that youre listenin to
Is from my guitar thats named Lucille
Im very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame
I dont think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when Im blue its seems like Lucille
Tryin to help me callin my name
I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille started singin blues
Well now when Im payin my dues
Maybe you dont know what I mean when I say payin my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always I can always you you know like depend on Lucille
Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess Ill let Lucille say
All of a few words and then
You know I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that Ive gone through
Like well for instance if I have a girlfriend and shes misusin me
And I go home at night maybe Im lonely
Well not maybe I am lonely
I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I cant even say nothin
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin
You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr
I dont think I still could do it
Cause Lucille dont wanna play nothin but the blues
And I think Im I think Im pretty glad about that
Cause dont nobody sing to me like Lucille sing Lucille
Well Ill put it like this take it easy Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank Sammy little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this
A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille take it easy now
You know Ive met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two three times
No kidding really has
I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin over it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me really it held it up off of me
So thats one time it saved my life
The way the way I uh I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist Arkansas I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin you know what I mean
And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin to save Lucille
Uh oh I I imagine youre still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And thats been Lucille ever since to me
One more now Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me can I do one more
Look out Lucille
Sounds really good I think Ill try one more alright

With time to kill
I borrowed Jebbs rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim

Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brothers rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
Thats where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head

The whole town was there

High up in his chair
Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind

2958,"Its 4am Ive got the Hasenpfeffer Ale
Ive got nothing to lose so Im pissing on the third rail
Groggyeyed and fried and Im headed for the station
Dtrain ride to Coney Island vacation
This ones dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1train
Theyll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstile I lost my last token
Riding between the cars pissing smoking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy Yo put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post Fulton Street downtown
Same faces every day but you dont know their names
Party people going places on the D train
Stop that train I wanna get on
Check it
Trench coat wingtip going to work
And youll be pullin a train like youre Captain Kirk
Pickpocket gangsters payin their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernhard Goetz
Overworked and underpaid starin at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors
Now youre stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
5000 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise your Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin
Elevated platform Im never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductors booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loudspeaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin El Diario
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station to Orange Julius
I bought a hot dog from WHO George Drakoulias

582,"I want you to if you dont mind Carl Id like you to stay out and help us on some songs play the guitar
Id love to
One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business Appreciate a little help on the guitar all right
Well my daddy left home when I was three
And he didnt leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now I dont blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left he went and named me Sue
Well he mustve thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and Id get red
And some guyd laugh then Id bust his head
I tell ya life aint easy for a boy named Sue
Well I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fists got hard and my wits got keen
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
Id search the honkytonks and bars
And kill the man who gave me that awful name
Well it was Gatlinburg in midJuly
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought Id stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealing stud
Sat the dirty mangy dog that named me Sue
Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a wornout picture that my motherd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said My name is Sue How do you do
Now youre going to die
Yeah thats what I told him
Well I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and agouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
I tell you Ive fought tougher men
But I really cant remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin at me and I saw him smile
And he said Son this world is rough
And if a mans gonna make it hes gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldnt be there to help you along
So I give you that name and I said goodbye
I knew youd have to get tough or die
And its that name that helped to make you strong
Yeah
He said Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and you got the right
To kill me now and I wouldnt blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye
Because Im the sonofabitch that named you Sue
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son I think Im gonna name him
Bill or George Anything but Sue I still hate that name

3157,"There Must Be an Angel Playing with My Heart Lyrics
Noone on earth could feel like this
Im thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an angel
Playing with my heart
I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
Its an orchestra of angels
And theyre playing with my heart
Must be talking to an angel

Noone on earth could feel like this

There must be an angel
Playing with my heart
And when I think that Im alone
It seems theres more of us at home
Its a multitude of angels
And theyre playing with my heart

Watching angels celebrating

By celestial intervention
Leavin me the recollection
Of your heavenly connection

872,"Confusion is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
Big as the ocean
And equally hardâtoâcontrol
So save yourâpredictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripeâfor comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the futures no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before
The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man
Can be greater than the sum
Thats not a negative thought
Im positive positive positive
Falling down not staying down
Coulda held me up rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the futures no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before
Numbers keep falling off the calendars floor
Were stuck in our boxes
Windows open no more
Couldnt lift up the forgetmenots
Not recalling what theyre for

Cause theyre out of this world

Fall away their circumstance

949,"Up In The Studio Gettin Blown Pt 2 Freestyle Lyrics
I heard they counting me out
Well they must not know how to count
Thats why they broke now
I float like a brick of coke in the drought
Human crack in the flesh niggas know what Im bout
Everybody down Im just scoping them out
Had your bitch poking it out while Im stroking her mouth
Got the clip poking me now so keep poking your mouth
Or get lit up like a candle when Im blowing em out
Real nigga all day stay strapped with it
You gotta go get it then come back with it
Young Slick Rick no patch with it
Lit nigga hot boy no match with it
Still gettin money you can hashtag facts with it
And yall niggas still broke all caps with it
Im still the shit no laxative
I bagged your bitch no accident
Told her suck my dick no grabbing it
She told me watch your head got tracks in it
I told her wash the pot it got crack in it
When Im in Cali every blunt got wax in it
All these niggas wanna do is post IG pics
But shit you only gon see em on IG with
Thats your IG jewels thats your IG whip
See em forreal like where the shit on IG went
Me if I post it I own it
Still killing niggas my condolensces
My nigga Country youngin silly but he coming with it
Finger itchy bust a semi til its nothing in it
Say dont play when it come to the gun mister
All I do is point out em out and he gon have fun with ya
big bro time to work these niggas
Lord knows who helped birth these niggas
Time to rock now
I want everybody spot now
Me the one excluded from him including my friends
Im back hes moving again
Dealing like Pac got the juice in my hands
They aint never cooked coke til the jar broke
Or whipped up so much you felt like your arms broke
Hit em with the ice man look like a bar of soap
Take it out let it dry now you got a blonde hoe
Blonde bitch white girl you never had a Carlos
Santana hoe aka Billy Blanco
Sorry to be the one to tell ya but
You aint got a car nigga if you got a car note
You aint never sold one
You aint never sit down and break down a whole one
Stretched til the flow come
Since a youngin I was focused 
You was living on the block I was tryna controll it
I always wanted so much money I couldnt fold it
Then I got so much money I couldnt hold it
Now Im back money so I dont get molded
Gold chain gold watch gold bracelet on me
Keep the banger on me in case a nigga tryna take it off me
Gold ring gold piece Harlem shake it on me
Nigga tryna take it off me he gon meet his maker homie
Still smoking like jamaicans homie
Coke on the grill and I aint talking bout Jamaica homie
Yall niggas know me A1 since day one
And told to stay that way until my day come
But all this fake love will make you hate love
And all these fake niggas make me hate niggas
But God put people in your life for a reason
Some for a lifetime some for a season
Never bite the hand thats reaching
Out just to help ya you might just need it believe it
Morals is important thats why I enforce it
Never burn a bridge after you cross it
Fuck it we burn it before we cross it
we get accross it everybody bosses
Shine help your niggas get rich get rich
Never treat these bitches like the world and your niggas like shit
If he go we go
If he come we come
If he know then he dont
Its each one teach one
All my niggas put in work each one squeeze one
Niggas always on they think they tough shit
Til they head spontanesouly combusted
We dont retaliate we decapitate
Make niggas disappear evaporate
Im fire evacuate
Booty niggas get tossed no salad plate
Im fire evacuate
Booty niggas get tossed no salad plate

Hey listen dont you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and thats not right
Theyre playing out a game that draws you closer
Till youre living in a world thats ruled by fear
Always taking baby but thats okay

Told you once youre never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face
We are screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then youre pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck

Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I dont talk about it but thats all right

1366,"LoveStoned I Think She Knows Interlude Lyrics
Hey Uh
Shes freaky and she knows it
Shes freaky and I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except shes got a little more ass
Dont even bother
Unless youve got that thing she likes
Ooh I hope shes goin home with me tonight
Hey
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
Shes got me love stoned man I swear
Shes bad and she knows I think that she knows uh
Shes freaky and she knows it
Shes freaky but I like it
Yeah
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
Shes flawless like some uncut ice
Well I hope shes goin home with me tonight oh
And all she wants is to dance
Thats why youll find her on the floor
But you dont have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
Thats why shes goin home with me tonight oh
Hey

304,"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andr Incomplete Lyrics
I met you in a club in Atlanta Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like Yeah nigga right
But you gave me your number anyway you were on the talcum
Powderhows about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day studied the history of music
By night just to pay for that shit youd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasnt on the same page but in
The same book of life so Id page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when youre on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head Im thinking Cool
Just when I think Im going down your shirt
Youre hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
Youd drop me off by the Dungeon
Never came in but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sack so they could function
WWWell yes and no
Yes we were selling it but no it wasnt blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled Ho
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in they earyou know what Im saying but
I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chipflip with the roamroam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home but
When I got home I never did
By the time I did heard that youd had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied See you later
When he got the good newsthats life shit
Now Im nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but Im living with my PopPop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
Yeah kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more follow me
Are you starting to gather what Im getting at
Now if Im losing you tell me then Ill double back
But keep in mind At the time Keep it real was the phrase
Silly when said now but those were the days
When Spring Break and Daytona
And Freakniks made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South but that aint a Kodak
Moment on went myself and Big Bo
Well you knew hm as Twan
Thats rightyou were around before this shit begun
Well Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some gnac
Girls used to say Yall talk funny Yall from the islands
And Id laugh and theyd just keep smiling
No Im from Atlanta baby he from Savannahmaybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down hey we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes
Shes playing tennis disturbing the tenants
Fifteenlove fit like glove
Description is like fifteen doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatoseagree
Enough about mehows about you Hows the lil kid
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadnt smoked or took a shot of drink
Cause Id start the second album off on another note now
That note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see Id balled out and fore Id fall out
Id slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes I was on the rise yeast was the street
To make bread never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
Id meet Muslims gangstas bitches rastas
And macaroni niggas impastas
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching but I started liking this girl
Now you know her as Erykah On On Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone Why you
Do that girl like that boy You ought to be ashamed
The song wasnt about me and that aint my name
Were young in love in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion had a son
By the name of Seven
And hes five by the time I do this mix hell probably be six
You do the rithmetic me do the language arts
Yall stand against the wall blindfolded we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays mama
Or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit thats been sitting in his yard
You fix it up you trick it out
You give it rims you give it bump
You give it all your time because thats all you can think about
And thats as far as I got
music fades 
And thats as far as I got and where I wanted to go knowing the whole summer thats all you could think about Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up you need a jump like you need and you want to grow and you change all the time So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summerthe next summer you didnt want that Rabbit no more You wanted something bigger and better
So the summer passed and now the Rabbits old
Right right so now you want a Cadillac
