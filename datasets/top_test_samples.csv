That sly comehither stare
That strips my conscience bare
Its witchcraft
And Ive got no defense for it

825,"When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin on a string
She told me it was my ding a ling ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling
When mamma took me to Sunday School
They tried to teach me the golden rule
Every time the choir would sing
Id sit there and play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling
When Pa started me to Grammar School
I found a place in the vestibule
And every time the bell would ring
Theyd catch me playin with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
Once I was climbing the garden wall
Oh and I had an awful fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But I never let go of my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

We used to play house on the kitchen floor
Shed be the queen Id be the king
Together wed play with my ding a ling a ling

I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling

This here song it is so sad
To those of you who never had
Silver bells hanging on a string

1324,"As I awoke this evening
With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I cant believe I said
I cant believe our Warlords dead
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers guns
Oh great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
Ive read the writing of the smoke
And breastfed on the sound of drums
Ive learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftains daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red mans race be slowly crushed
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears
I take only what is mine Lord
My pony my squaw and my child
I cant stay to see you die
Along with my tribes pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run
Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
Hed been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead
Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I cant find a home
Its lonely and its quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think its time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon Ill find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole
",die Along with my tribes pride I go to search for the yellow moon And the fathers of our sons Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold And the healing waters run Trampling down the prairie rose Leaving hoof tracks in the sand Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead Hed been laying down his weapons When they filled him full of lead Now there seems no reason why I should carry on In this land that once was my land I cant find a home Its lonely and its quiet And the horse soldiers are coming And I think its time I strung my bow And ceased my senseless running For soon Ill find the yellow moon Along with my loved ones Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields Without the sound of guns And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Comes with a bullet hole,As I awoke this evening With the smell of woodsmoke clinging Like a gentle cobweb hanging Upon a painted tepee Oh I went to see my chieftain With my warlance and my woman For he told us that the yellow moon Would very soon be leaving This I cant believe I said I cant believe our Warlords dead Oh he would not leave the chosen ones To the buzzards and the soldiers guns Oh great father of the Iroquois Ever since I was young Ive read the writing of the smoke And breastfed on the sound of drums Ive learned to hurl the tomahawk And ride a painted pony wild To run the gauntlet of the Sioux To make a chieftains daughter mine And now you ask that I should watch The red mans race be slowly crushed What kind of words are these to hear From Yellow Dog whom white man fears I take only what is mine Lord My pony my squaw and my child I cant stay to see you

2049,"Lets dance in style lets dance for a while
Heaven can wait were only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not
Let us die young or let us live forever
We dont have the power but we never say never

Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagnes always cold and the musics always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today cause theres no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment smoke some weed drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind

2247,"My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
The way he described it he said Id be better dead than live
I didnt listen to his jive
I knew all along that he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought I was crazy but Im not
Oh no
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
He said I need treatment but Im not that easily led
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight to be out of my mind

With all my crazy ideas but I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius

I knew that this was meant to be
Now I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight
Thats why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic didnt know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three but I was swinging
They all laugh at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry if they just couldnt understand
The idiomatic logic that went on in my head
I had a brain it was insane
Oh they used to laugh at me when I refused to ride
On all those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
But I said Dear doctor I think that its you instead
Because I Ive got a thing thats unique and new
To prove it Ill have the last laugh on you
Cause instead of one head I got two
And you know two heads are better than one

2161,"I hear the train acomin its rolling round the bend
And I aint seen the sunshine since I dont know when
Im stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps draggin on
But that train keeps arollin on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me Son
Always be a good boy dont ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin I hang my head and cry
I bet theres rich folks eatin in a fancy dining car
Theyre probably drinkin coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming I know I cant be free
But those people keep amovin and thats what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine
I bet Id move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison thats where I want to stay
And Id let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time
So gold
Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever
And be in time
Stay gold
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
Oh gold

Dont believe the hype

Show em that we can do this
Here we go again
Uh your bad self
Help us break this down from off the shelf
Heres a music servin you so use it
Papa got a brand new funk
Get down Party for your right 
Huh lets get it on like we said before
They say the brothers causing trouble
Hate to bust their bubble
Cause we rumble from our lower level
To condition your condition were gonna do a song
That you never heard before
Make you all jump along to the education
Brothers gonna work it out
And stop chasing
Brothers brothers gonna work it out
You got itwhat it takes
Go get itwhere you want it
Go get itget involved
Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out
So many of us in limbo
How to get it on its quite simple
Three stones from the sun
We need a piece of this rock
Our goal indestructible soul

To the Brothers in the street

113,"Yeahyeah
Well I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin names kicks back on you then I hope this does the trick
Cause Im sick of your complainin about how many bills
And Im sick of all your bitchin bout your poodles and your pills
And I just cant see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife
Eat the rich theres only one thing theyre very good for
Eat the rich I take one bite now come back for more
Eat the rich I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich I take one bite now spit out the rest uh huh
So I called up my head shrinker and I told him what Id done
He said Youd best go on a diet yeah I hope you have some fun
Anda dont go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
Cause you wont get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food
Now theyre smokin up the junk bonds and then they go get stiff
And theyre dancin in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But theres one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit but go real good with wine
Eat the rich theres only one thing theyre good for
Eat the rich I take one bite now come back for more
Eat the rich I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich I take one bite now spit out the rest uh
Believe in all the good things that money just cant buy
Then you wont get no belly ache from eatin humble pie
I believe in rags to riches your inheritance wont last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend and shove it up your ass

Reflecting on my past life and it doesnt have much time
Cos at five oclock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that theres some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream
Somebody please tell me that Im dreaming
Its not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall but why am I crying
After all Im not afraid of dying
Dont I believe that there never is an end
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell God be with you
If theres a God why has He let me go
As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near Im not sorry
Catch my soul its willing to fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Dont worry now that I have gone
Ive gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then youll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah yeah yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah yeah yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah

Baby did you hear that Yeah baby I heard it too
Look out the window golly the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals havent a clue as to what the fuck is going on
Im on the telephone dialing the Dungeon Hello 
This Dre bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby grab the baby cause baby it aint much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and thats a sign
Omega nigga IFOs are landing in Decatur
Hope Im not over your head but if so you will catch on later
Played the track guess she could not take it anymo
Raping her heavenly body like a ho coochie so
From niggas constantly fucking her never loving her
Never showing appreciation busting nuts in her face when they done
Who said good folks is not supposed to die
The sky is falling nobody balling they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs but the Hornets they won
Nigga we slum kept all the guns I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew theyd try to ram me
But Im stabbing making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky east west no clouds
Him coming now fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay Yeah yeah she chillin
We should be at The Dungeon shortly aint nobody on they porch see
Approaching the final exit Im thinking I see four horsies
But I dont though nigga you wont know until its on ya
I put that on my dope boys from ATown to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know theyre smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

3738,"Summer Soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning Rain
Gently plays her rhythms on your windowpane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine
And so you wait to see what shell do
Is it sun or rain for you
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find its October
And shes gone
And shes gone
Summers gone
Taking with her summers play
Winter Wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer he begins
Forcing dangers way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when he never lets you know
If its snow or clear days youll find
And so you wait to see what hell do
Is it sun or snow for you
But it breaks your heart in two
Cause youve been fooled by April
And hes gone
And hes gone
Winters gone

Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky
They said itd never come we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye the end has just begun
Distorted figures walk the street its 1999
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines
Bodies melted like a candle a land without a face
No time to change your fate no time left its too late
The arsenal of megadeath cant be rid they said
And if it comes the living will envy the dead
Racing for power and all come in last
No winning first stone cast
This falsehood worldly peace
Its treaties soon will cease
No one will be left to prove that humans existed
Maybe soon the children will be born openfisted
We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke
Too bad they couldnt see this lethal energy
And now the final scene a global darkening
Dig deep piles of rubble and ruins
Towering overhead both far and wide
Theres unknown tools for World War III
Einstein said Well use rocks on the other side
No survivors
Set the world afire

3774,"Nothing But Flowers Lyrics
Here we stand
Like an Adam and Eve
Waterfalls
Garden of Eden
Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
Birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs cars have run on gasoline
Where Where have they gone
Now its nothing but flowers
There was a factory
Now there are mountains and rivers
Youve got it youve got it
We caught a rattlesnake
Now weve got something for dinner
Youve got it youve got it
There was a shopping mall
Now its all covered with flowers
Youve got it youve got it
If this is paradise
I wish I had a lawn mower
Youve got it youve got it
Years ago
I was an angry young man
Id pretend
That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With the beautiful highway
This used to be real estate now its only fields and trees
Where Where is the town
Now its nothing but flowers
The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that wed start over
But I guess I was wrong
Once there were parking lots
Now its a peaceful oasis
Youve got it youve got it
This was a Pizza Hut
Now its all covered with daises
Youve got it youve got it
I miss the honky tonks
Dairy Queens and 7Elevens
Youve got it youve got it
And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
Youve got it youve got it
I dream of cherry pies
Candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
Youve got it youve got it
We used to microwave
Now we just eat nuts and berries
Youve got it youve got it
This was a discount store
Now its turned into a cornfield
Youve got it youve got it
Dont leave me stranded here
I cant get used to this lifestyle

502,"Well were living here in Allentown
And theyre closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem theyre killing time
Filling out forms standing in line
Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance danced with them slow
And were living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And its getting very hard to stay
Well were waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard if we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke chromium steel
And were waiting here in Allentown
But theyve taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away
Every child had a pretty good shot

Motion pictures on my TV screen
A home away from home and Im living in between
But I hear some people have got their dream
Ive got mine
I hear the mountains are doing fine
Morning glory is on the vine
And the dew is fallin
The ducks are callin
Yes Ive got mine
Well all those people
They think they got it made
But I wouldnt buy sell borrow or trade
Anything I have to be like one of them
Id rather start all over again
Well all those headlines they just bore me now
Im deep inside myself but Ill get out somehow
And Ill stand before you
And Ill bring a smile to your eyes

And Im shaking so much really yearning

1733,"Walking across the sittingroom I turn the television off
Sitting beside you I look into your eyes
As the sound of motor cars fades in the nighttime
I swear I saw your face change it didnt seem quite right
And its Hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true
Coming closer with our eyes a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And its Hey babe your suppers waiting for you
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true
Ive been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
Its good to feel you again
Its been a long long time
Hasnt it
I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire
You cant you see hes fooled you all
Yes hes here again
Cant you see hes fooled you all
Share his peace sign the lease
Hes a supersonic scientist
Hes a guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life youll walk inside
Hand in hand gland in gland
With a spoonful of miracle
Hes the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you rock you little snake 
We will keep you snug and warm 
Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of darkskinned warriors
Standing still below the ground
Waiting for battle
Fights begun theyve been released
Killing foe for peace
Bang bang bang bang bang bang
And theyre giving me a wonderful potion
Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though Im feeling good
Something tells me Id better activate my prayer capsule
Todays a day to celebrate the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord
Wandering through the chaos the battle has left
We climb up a mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
Hes been stamped Human Bacon by some butchery tool
He is you
Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower 
If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies or flutterbyes or gutterflies
Open your eyes its full of surprise everyone lies
Like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh theres mum and dad and good and bad
And everyones happy to be here
Theres Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag plastic bag what a drag
The frog was a prince the prince was a brick the brick was an egg
The egg was a bird
Fly away you sweet little thing 
Theyre hard on your tail 
Havent you heard
Theyre going to change you 
Into a human being 
Yes were happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning
Weve got everything were growing everything
Weve got some in weve got some out
Weve got some wild things floating about
Everyone were changing everyone
You name them all weve had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
All change 
Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad
Daddiddleyoffice daddiddleyoffice
Youre all full of ball
Dad to dam to dum to mum
Mumdiddleywashing mumdiddleywashing
Woo youre all full of ball
Let me hear your lies
Were living this up to the eyes
Ooh ah nanana
Mama I want you now
And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors tidy floors more applause
Youve been here all the time
Like it or not like what you got
Youre under the soil The soil the soil 
Yes deep in the soil The soil the soil the soil the soil 
So well end with a whistle and end with a bang
And all of us fit in our places
With the guards of Magog swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell hes doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise it wont be easy
666 is no longer below
Hes getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing
Sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood hes writing the lyrics of a brandnew tune
And its Hey babe with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true
Ive been so far from here
Far from your loving arms
Now Im back again and babe its gonna work out fine
Cant you feel our souls ignite
Shedding everchanging colours in the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean as the germ in a seed grows
Weve finally been freed to get back home
Theres an angel standing in the sun
And hes crying with a loud voice
This is the supper of the mighty one
Lord of lords king of kings
Has returned to lead his children home
To take them to the new Jerusalem

Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair
Launched that shot and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by

He went for his to find he didnt have one
Put him in check correct with my egggun
The egg a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke
The trigger I pulled his face the yolk
Reached in his pocket took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers they come a dime a dozen

Ready to throw

Tossed it out the window three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman he said Bloodclot

Just for two though you never knew you were my reason
Ive gone much too far for you now to say
That Ive got to throw my castle away
Over dreams I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you Ive been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day
And though you dont believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed over loved over me
Over hearts I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find I had found what Ive searched to discover
Ive come much too far for me now to find
The love that Ive sought can never be mine
And though you dont believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed over loved over me
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed over loved over you
Over you
",Over hearts I have painfully turned every stone Just to find I had found what Ive searched to discover Ive come much too far for me now to find The love that Ive sought can never be mine And though you dont believe that they do They do come true For did my dreams Come true when I looked at you And maybe too if you would believe You too might be Overjoyed over loved over me And though the odds say improbable What do they know For in romance All true love needs is a chance And maybe with a chance you will find You too like I Overjoyed over loved over you Over you,Over time Ive been building my castle of love Just for two though you never knew you were my reason Ive gone much too far for you now to say That Ive got to throw my castle away Over dreams I have picked out a perfect come true Though you never knew it was of you Ive been dreaming The sandman has come from too far away For you to say come back some other day And though you dont believe that they do They do come true For did my dreams Come true when I looked at you And maybe too if you would believe You too might be Overjoyed over loved over me

The execution of your mind you really had to turn
The race is run the book is read the end begins to show
The truth is out the lies are old but you dont want to know
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that youre on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
The people who have crippled you you wanna see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you and theres just no return

Far from all the soot and noise of the city
Theres a village green
Oh its been a long time
Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple
Down by the village green
Twas there I met a girl called Daisy
And kissed her by the old oak tree
Although I loved my Daisy I sought fame
And so I left the village green
I miss the village green
And all the simple people
I miss the village green
The church the clock the steeple
I miss the morning dew fresh air and Sunday school
And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities
American tourists flock to see the village green
They snap their photographs and say Gawd darn it
Isnt it a pretty scene
And Daisys married Tom the grocer boy
And now he owns a grocery
I miss the village green
And all the simple people
I miss the village green
The church the clock the steeple
I miss the morning dew fresh air and Sunday school
And I will return there
And Ill see Daisy
And well sip tea laugh
And talk about the village green
We will laugh
And talk about the village green

44,"Thugz Mansion Lyrics
Shit tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong thats just for us
Niggas aint gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Yknahmean Where do niggas go when we die
Aint no heaven for a thug nigga
Thats why we go to thug mansion
Thats the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and woulda tried
But when I held that 9 all I could see was my mamas eyes
No one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
Not knowin its hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs aint have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we Gs
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my minds eye I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chillin with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromedout mansion in paradise in the sky
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness
Trouble sparks they tell me Home is where the heart is
Dear departed I shed tattooed tears
And couldnt sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us theyd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they cant stand us
Is there a way for me to change
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
Cause all the rest dead is there a spot for us to grow
If you find it Ill be right behind ya show me and Ill go
How can I be peaceful Im comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream Peace while the other man shot him
I need a house thats full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chillin with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromedout mansion in paradise in the sky
Dear Mama dont cry your baby boys doin good
Tell the homies Im in Heaven and they aint got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night it had me shook
Drinkin peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin there kickin it with Malcolm til the day came
Little Latasha sho grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that shes forgiven so come home
Maybe in time youll understand
Only God can save us when Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on they in Heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what Im askin
Remember this face save me a place in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chillin with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky In thugs mansion 
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromedout mansion in paradise in the sky Thugs mansion

3633,"Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind
Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground the fate you feel draws near
Fatality reality await the final call
My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
Come and die with me forever share insanity
Do you wanna die
The waves of blood are rushing near pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity reaching back into my mind
Nonrising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am what I want Im only after death

3425,"Im the king of rock there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
To burn my kingdom you must use fire
I wont stop rockin till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers cant stand us but give us respect
They called us hip were gettin iller
Theres no one chiller
Its not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper I know I can hang
Im Run from RunDMC like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You cant touch me with a tenfoot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when were on the tape were fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person were a verbal treat
Its me and DMC Jay wheres the beat
Now were the baddest of the bad the coolest of the cool
Im DMC I rock and roll Im DJ Run I rock and rule
Its not a Trick or Treat and its not a April Fool
Its all brand new never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you cant comprehend
When your mind wont wiggle and your knees wont bend
Music aint nothin but a peoples jam
Its DJ Run DMC rockin without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages held many mics
Take airplane flights at huge heights
So all you sucker MCs you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high Im pulling down rees
Got a song so strong its knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe its RunDMCs
I am from around the way
And Run goes to school every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay HEY
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be meek
So dont try to diss me try to be my friend
Cause if you do youll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say shall set a trend
Because a devastating rap is what we send
Every jam we play we break two needles
Theres three of us but were not the Beatles
My name is Darryl you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack or you can call him DMC
People always ask DMC what does it mean
Ds for never dirty MC for mostly clean
Like we said before we rock hardcore
Im DJ Run I can scratch Im DMC I can draw
And now we got the knack to attract
Our rhymes an aphrodisiac
Well reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock give it all we got
To be MCs we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
Were cool cool cats its like that
Thats the way it is so stay the hell back
Were causin hard times for sucker MCs
Cause they dont make no songs like these

1933,"Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away
Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Brought by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming
Why then is God still protecting me
Even when I dont deserve it
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God wont keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise
Theyll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
Therell be penance to pay when its Judgment Day
And the guiltyll bleed when that moment comes
Theyll be coming to claim take your soul away
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross
Theyll be coming to bring the eternal flame
Theyll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed

Cursed thru the night through eyes of alarm

Hey Uh
Shes freaky and she knows it
Shes freaky and I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except shes got a little more ass
Dont even bother
Unless youve got that thing she likes
Ooh I hope shes goin home with me tonight

Shes got me love stoned man I swear

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
Shes flawless like some uncut ice
Well I hope shes goin home with me tonight oh
And all she wants is to dance
Thats why youll find her on the floor
But you dont have a chance

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Cant make the same mistake this time
We are the children the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear until nothing else remains
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome
Looking for something we can rely on
Theres gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear until nothing else remains
All the children say
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome
So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash

You try to ride car train bus or feet

Your ups your downs your highs and your lows
Wont you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes

We receive much lower pay
Id rather stay young go out and play

Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity

Disillusion is the word
Thats used by me when Im not heard

You noticed one time he was your man

1949,"Its snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
Theyre closing in the fortress is near
Its standing high in the sky
The cable cars the only way in
Its really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
Theyve got to try to save the day
The panicking cries the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare

Greetings earthlings
From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South the ATLiens aint changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga thats from the ATown see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality fallacy butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for yall Im looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows bwoi
The nigga the BIG like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks cause yall niggas jokes like the Joker
Im sick of these wack ass rappers like Im tired of hoes in chokers
Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from South Coast slums
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac
This ol sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged Andr to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low I guess you wilding
I say Look boy I aint for that fuck shitso fuck this
Let me explain only child style so you dont dis
I grew up to myself not round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments
Now who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from South Coast slums
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac
It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods Coupes to De Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill
In this atmosphere this aint no practice here
We cutting the fool now
Im doing ya at the house and throwing you out because Im through now
Dont you love the way we claiming Bankhead stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb thats never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop
Yeah tight like nuts and bolts sluts and hoes they get evicted
Im dealing wit Queens in my castleaint worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like Im they way up out the projects
Cant put you on my payroll and no I aint got no Rolex
Or no diamond at the exit with a sign saying Well rap for food
My face is bawled up cause I aint in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error
Bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out cause this be a freestyle
Now who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion
This side niggas dustin that side niggas lacin

We just drop

1736,"There is lambswool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries
Into flame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures
Are trapped in birth on celluloid
The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping theyll find peace
Each thought and gesture
Are caught in celluloid
Theres no hiding in my memory
Theres no room to avoid
The crawlers cover the floor
In the red ochre corridor
For my second sight of people
Theyve more lifeblood than before
Theyre moving in time
To a heavy wooden door
Where the needles eye is winking
Closing on the poor
The carpet crawlers heed their callers

They are pulled up by the magnet
Believing theyre free

1239,"I got the call today I didnt wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside loves open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew Im learning again
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
Theres a yearning undefined
People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and selfassurance that can lead to happiness
Theyre the very things we kill I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
Doesnt keep me warm
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you Baby
The more I know the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out I have to learn again
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
There are people in your life whove come and gone
They let you down and hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you life goes on
You keep carrin that anger itll eat you inside
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So Im thinkin about forgiveness

Even if even if you dont love me anymore

So I face the final curtain
My friend Ill say it clear
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
Ive traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh and more much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times Im sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
Ive loved Ive laughed and cried
Ive had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no no not me
I did it my way
For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Where you going Im leaving you No you aint
Come back Were runnin right back here we go again
Its so insane cause when its goin good its goin great
Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane
But when its bad its awful I feel so ashamed
I snapped Whos that dude I dont even know his name
I laid hands on her Ill never stoop so low again
I guess I dont know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when youre with em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin yeah them chills used to get em
Now youre gettin fuckin sick of lookin at em
You swore youd never hit em never do nothin to hurt em
Now youre in each others face
Spewin venom in your words when you spit em
You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em
Throw em down pin em
So lost in the moments when youre in em
Its the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say youre best to go your separate ways
Guess that they dont know ya
Cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over
Its a different day sound like broken records playin over
But you promised her next time youll show restraint
You dont get another chance life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess thats why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things did things that we didnt mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns same routine
But your tempers just as bad as mine is youre the same as me
When it comes to love youre just as blinded baby please
Come back it wasnt you baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems
Maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
Next time Im pissed Ill aim my fist at the drywall
Next time There wont be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
Im tired of the games I just want her back I know Im a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin leave again Ima tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire just gonna
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You was out there buggin fuckin
Doin your dirt when I was in the studio workin
Shit Im tryna make music thats perfect
Instead I gotta hear you out there foolin and flirtin
You and your friends got a bad reputation already
If Im not mistaken alreadyuh
But I gotta pologize to your mother and father
Shoulda never put my hands on your daughter
But I aint askin you to drop no charges shit
I did what I did deserve the consequence
I cant see myself coppin a plea
To one of these niggas who bleed the same as me

All because I was stupid and dumb
Shoulda never went through it with hun shit
But to this day I never knew this would come
I never thought that I would go through this with hun no
The one I wanted to marrywanted to carry my baby through life
Maybe this life we cant be together
Cant see together cant see each other

Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair til it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
And came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said Sit down I stood up
Ooh ooh growin up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldnt sail but she sure could sing
I pushed B52 and bombed them with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
But when they said Come down I threw up
Ooh ooh growin up
Work it back now
I took monthlong vacations in the stratosphere
And you know its really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth
But I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said Pull down I pulled up

Is there something on your mind
Youve gone and sold all your belongings
Is that something in your eye
Well I know you really never
Liked the way it all goes down
Go on Hideaway
Whats that you say
Were all bound for the graveyard
Oooh I wish you well
Think its going to rain
Oh whats the difference
Is there some way I can help
Because you know Im going to miss you
When youre gone oh Lord
Wish I Could Hideaway

4684,"The redheaded stranger from Blue Rock Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The redheaded stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait til tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
A yellowhaired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
The yellowhaired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didnt seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait til tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
The yellowhaired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free of course
For you cant hang a man for killing a woman
Whos trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And dont lay a hand on the bay
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again

I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven
Back in elementary I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed
Inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me Im not livin in the past
You wanna last Be the first to blast
Remember Kato no longer with us hes deceased
Call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
Ahh I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Now that Im strugglin in this business by any means
Label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause Im cursed
Im havin visions of leavin here in a hearse
God can you feel me
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
Im goin blind I spend my time in this cell aint livin well
I know my destiny is Hell where did I fail
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire Ill shed so many tears
Lord I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Now Im lost and Im weary so many tears
Im suicidal so dont stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now theres nothin left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldnt rest Im barely standin
About to go to pieces screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted I couldnt see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
Inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
No memories just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
Will I survive til the morning to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins cause here I come
Lord God 
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God I lost so many peers
And Lord knows I tried been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Brokenhearted as I glance at the chalk line gettin high
This aint the life for me I wanna change
But aint no future bright for me Im stuck in the game
Im trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately Ive been really wantin babies
So I could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
Dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
Im hearin noises think shes fuckin all my boys
Cant take no more Im fallin to the floor
Beggin for the Lord to let me in to Heavens door
Shed so many tears God please help me 
Lord I lost so many years I suffered through the years 
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
And seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff New York fire island
I cased the joint straining at the scenes
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came agrinnin
I snapped the smile off his face and scowled Give me a bourbon
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up I saw some contact
Then the big boys saw me and knew that
Id had too much floating around
Statues alive seconds are hours
Sacks like a hurricane wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess I dream in pictures not colours
The true free expression I demand is human rights right
I gave my life I am immortal

Flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybodys there but you dont seem to care
Whats it with you man and this garden Yeah
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy mans utopia
If youre lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the gardens song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
You can find it all inside no need to wrestle with your pride
No you aint losing your mind youre just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside for the garden
I wasnt really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering round for daze
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place

991,"And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the goodmen tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicely shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing they swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and lo It was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor

Cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
And the Devil may be here
But he cant sing about that
Oh and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers
Now the dress is hung the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead he could be not he could be you
Hes chameleon comedian Corinthian and caricature
Shooting up pieinthesky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutchhungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh and we were gone
Kings of oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mindwarp pavilion
Lay me place and bake me pie
Im starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes and door unlocked

Past shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion
I dont know what is real
I cant touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion
So Ill continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall
The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But Im not sure at all its my reflection
Im blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction
So Ill continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend

No matter if youre born
To play the king or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy
Becomes reality
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow
So Ill continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend

1746,"A carved oak table
Tells a tale
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room
To arbours cool
A time of valour and legends born
A time when honour meant much more to a man than life
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong
Through lance and sword
Why why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander
It seems because through time and space
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore
A dusty table
Musty smells
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey
That scars the panes
Gone the carving
And those who left their mark
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway
And the weak must die according to natures law
As old as they
Why why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander
It seems because through time and space

Tryna figure out the difference
But I thinkthink the lines are starting to get blurred
Im in a strange place
I feel like Mae when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like Im caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause Im mentally rearrangin his face
I need a change of pace
Cause the pace Im workin ats dangerous
Theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin em
Cause thats where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings
I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt youaim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes Jays Waynes and the Drakes
Im frustrated cause aint no more NSync now Im all out of whack
Im all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
Im goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is Im strapped for battle
Suck a duck crawl out the backits a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal
And beware of bar stools flyin through the air and bottles breakin mirrors also
And I aint stoppin til the swear jars full
You done called every woman a slut but youre forgetting Sarah Marshall Palin 
Oh my bad slut And next time I show up to court
Ill be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like Thats sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you smartass
Youre lucky I dont tear it off you
And jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
Youre so fuckin gravy Marshall I should start callin you au jus
Cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil Twin take this beat now its all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasnt for this verseso satanic
KMart chains panic cause they cant even spin back the curse words
Cause theyre worse when theyre reversed motherfucker

And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin Fuck Shit Fuck
Adult with a childishlike arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like Merits
Fuck that Id rather be loud and I like swearin
From the first album even the gals were like Tight lyrics dreamy eyes
But my fuckin mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition Haha 
Hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius whos bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where Im at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first then ignore the replies
Theres darkness closing in Evil twin there it goes again My evil twin 
It controls my pen My evil twin but that aint me its my evil twin
Then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin 
But hes just a friend Evil twin who pops up now and again Evil twin 
So dont blame me Evil twin blame him its my evil twin
Then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin 
Welcome back to the land of the living my friend
You have slept for quite some time
So whos left Lady Gaga Mess with the Bieber
Nah F with Christina
I aint fuckin with either Jessica neither Simpson or Alba
My albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic Excedrin Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3s
Feel like Im burnin to death but Im freezin
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heathuh
Ledger
My suicide notes barely legible read the
Bottom its signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
Shell sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch Give up my dick for pussy
Ill be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly wolly I vent heat register Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
When on the steps I met DeShaun at Osborn
Id never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap
Used to mop floors flip burgers and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes tryna get props for em
Cause I took book smarts and swapped for em
They were sleepin I made em stop snorin
Made em break out the popcorn
Now Ive been hip hop in its tiptop form
Since NWA was blarin through my car windows
Leanin on the horn screamin Fuck the police like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five bitch Im top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spots for
And crazy as I am Im much tamer than him and Im nuts
Then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem
But no ones insaner than Slim look at that Evil grin 
Evil twin please come in what was your name again
Hi Faggot
Look whos back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
And youre all aware I dont got it all upstairs
Guess thats why Im an addict and its so small up there
Peace to Whitney
Jeez just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause Im so sick of bein the truth
I wish someoned finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh LMFAO no way Jo
se Baez couldnt beat this rapOJ no
Hooray Im off the hook like Casey Anthony hey ho Hey ho 
I sound like Im tryna sing the fuckin chorus to Hip Hop Hooray
No Im hollerin you got bottomend like an 808
And I base whether were fuckin off that instead of your face so
Let your lowend raise yo
Tango what you think ho Slow dancin or bowling
You tryin to hold hands with your homie
What you think Im lookin for romance cause Im lonely
Change that tune you aint got a remote chance to control me
Ho Im only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over it wont hurt
Dont try to fix me Im broke so I dont work
So are you but youre broke cause you dont work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced yall to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same

bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition Haha Hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius whos bored of his lines And that sort of defines where Im at and the way I feel now Feel like I might just strike first then ignore the replies Theres darkness closing in Evil twin there it goes again My evil twin It controls my pen My evil twin but that aint me its my evil twin Then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin But hes just a friend Evil twin who pops up now and again Evil twin So dont blame me Evil twin blame him its my evil twin Then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin Welcome back to the land of the living my friend

1800,"They sat in an Abandoned Luncheonette
Sipping imaginary cola and drawing faces in the tabletop dust
His voice was rusty from years as a sergeant on this mans army
They were old and crusty
She was twenty when the diner was a baby
He was the dishwasher busy in the back his hands covered with gravy
Hair black and wavy
Brilliantine slick a pot cleaning dandy
He was young and randy
Day to day to day today
Then they were old their lives wasted away
Month to month year to year
They all run together
Time measured by the peeling of paint on the luncheonette wall
They sat together in the empty diner
Filled with cracked china
Old news was blowing across the filthy floor
And the sign on the door read this way out thats all it read
Thats all it said

3037,"Well its the MIcrooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please aint nothing but incense in my atmosphere
Im bending corners in my Lac boi
Cause thats how we be rolling here
Deep the slang is in effect because its Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo heaters cause you sposed to cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now Im just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid cause it aint nothing to see
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No my heart dont pump no KoolAid
Jump and youll get too sprayed
Who raise yo block The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting swiftly
They aint gon get me got something fo em
The devil up in yo grill and you still dont even know em
Show em whos the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes I got soul
Thats something that you aint got
Thats why your style is rotten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell swollen got my pockets business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that its that
Its that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you dont abuse it
We gonna get cha high Southernplayalistic 
High Southernplayalistic 
Time to drop these bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ho and knock em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do
Is in the house like a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
Im packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue its funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true
Well okey dokey Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville can you handle that you rat
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge PUMP
You want to do a jack I heat the barrel til its empty get me
See I aint friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but dont try gaffling me
Cause sleep and youll get served with some Southern hospitality

Well Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid

So back up off it get up on it if you want it yall
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Players Ball yup
So now I step rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac
Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue the sun is beaming its seeming
That Im glistening rather gleaming
2020 got me leaning to the side full of pride

People movin out people movin in
Why Because of the color of their skin
Run run run but you sure cant hide
An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and Ill set you free
Rap on brother rap on
Well the only person talkin bout Love thy brother
Is the preacher
And it seems nobodys interested in learnin
But the teacher
Segregation determination demonstration integration Aggravation humiliation obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion
Oh yeah
Thats what the world is today
Woo hey hey
The sale of pills are at an alltime high
Young folks walkin round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on
Evolution revolution gun control the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon kids growin up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So round and around and around we go
Where the worlds headed said nobody knows
Oh Great Googa Mooga
Cant you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah thats what the world is today
Woo hey hey
Fear in the air tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new records a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction tax deduction
City inspectors bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand population out of hand
Suicide too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting End the war
And the band played on

Light it up uhh
The whole city is mine prettiest Don
I dont like the way P Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why its mentioned in my rhymes Fuck it
Its just an intro hate it or love it like it bump it or dump it
Write it across the stomach spell God son
Life is like a jungle black its like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact its harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on MAC strong couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body now they hauntin the block
Where they used to stand at somebodys takin they place
A younger man perhaps hand slaps cant understand that
Same walk same talk I wonder can that be possible
A thug dies another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you layin low with a bottle
Im blowin circles my state of mind purple
Light it light it uhh
Yeah light it up
Light it up uhh
Yall just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things yall ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out not even your girl is sacred
You dont trust a soul hold up you moldin soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybodys under six feet of ground but you
Still standin still roamin through the streets thats real
You a survivor knowin all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now thats ready
Trustin your judgment quick to put it down they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That aint love its hate think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you aint got a cut on your face
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell em how to reach through the bars holdin a mirror
Lookin down a tear in jail makin weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Coldblooded murderers universal
Hood to hood blowin smoke state of mind is purple
Light it up light it up light it up uhh
Light it up light it up light it up uhh
Uhh uhh uhh light it light it uhh
These hotheaded youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin before thinkin they easily irritated
And murders premeditated its a fact that we sinkin
When we should be climbin in a nutshell its just jail
Drug sales liquor and diamonds niggas rewindin
Instead of movin forward to blow up so whats the science
People shoutin police pushin the crowd
And on the grounds a young soldier with meat hangin out him
Am I hallucinatin off the hazin
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another niggas face in
Its a ugly nation cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
Its usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up then someonell snitch
A divideandfall strategy they arent fair
I dig in my bag of weed thats covered with orange hair
This Color Purplell make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anythingll hurt you so my state of minds all purple

Cold kickin ass scratch cold kickin ass scratch
Cold kickin ass scratch Kick that shit
Pull up a chair echoes
I dont drink brass monkey like the beat funky
Nickname EazyE yo 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kickin to show my shit
Rappin holdin my dick boy I dont quit
Crowd rockin motherfucker from around the way
I got a sixshooter yo mean hombre
Rollin through the hood to find the boys
To kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and its freezin my balls
I hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gayes greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whompin
Cruisin through the Eastside south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
I was Cold kickin ass
I was Raised in LA
I was Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Too much posse
Ridin on Slauson lookin for Crenshaw
Turned down the sound to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tilt cause I was drunk
See a sissyass punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause its like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title Im holdin

You know I dont like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made
Shes a real nice girl and shes always there for you
But a nice girl wouldnt tell you what you should do
Oh listen boy Im sure that you think you got it all under control
You dont want somebody telling you the way to stay in someones soul
Youre a big boy now and youll never let her go
But thats just the kind of thing she ought to know
Tell her about it tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that youre for real
Tell her about it tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her let her know how much she means

To ensure yourself youve got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone youre always insecure
And theres only one good way to reassure
Tell her about it let her know how much you care
When she cant be with you tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it every day before you leave
Pay her some attention give her something to believe
Cause now and then shell get to worrying
Just because you havent spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when shes gone
Listen boy its good information from a man whos made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes
Shes a trusting soul shes put her trust in you
But a girl like that wont tell you what you should do
Tell her about it tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that youre for real
Tell her about it tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her let her know how much she means
Tell her about it tell her how you feel right now

You got to tell her about it before it gets too late

Do I have to change my name
Will it get me far
Should I lose some weight
Am I gonna be a star
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
Its why I wrote this song
This type of modern life is it for me
This type of modern life is it for free
So I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
Its more easily said
Its always been the same
This type of modern life is not for me
This type of modern life is not for free

I live the American Dream American Dream 
You are the best thing Ive seen
You are not just a dream American life 
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part

Just what I did it for

So Im checking out the bodies and you know Im satisfied
Im digging on the isotopes this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope you know Im satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager an agent and a chef
Three nannies an assistant and a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler and a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist do you think Im satisfied

I couldnt sleep a wink
And I could only get unconscious
If Id had too much to drink
There was somehow
Something wrong somewhere
And each day seemed grey and dead
The seeds of desperation
Were growing in me head
I needed inspiration
A brand new start in life
Somewhere to place affection
But I didnt want a wife
And then by lucky chance I saw
In a special magazine
An ad that was unusual
The like Id never seen
Experience something different
With our new imported toy
Shes loving warm inflatable
And a guarantee of joy
She came all wrapped in cardboard
All pink and shriveled down
A breath of air was all she needed
To make her lose that frown
I took her to the bedroom
And pumped her with some life
And later in a moment
That girl became my wife
And so I sit her in the corner
And sometimes stroke her hair
And when Im feeling naughty
I blow her up with air
Shes cuddly and shes bouncy
Shes like a rubber ball
I bounce her in the kitchen
And I bounce her in the hall
And now my life is different
Since Sally came my way
I wake up in the morning
And have her on a tray
Shes everything they said she was
And I wear a permanent grin
And I only have to worry
In case my girl wears thin

Glimmering nightgowns poisonous as cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe

But as she deeply moves me
Shed rather shoot me in my tracks

She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her

And I put a timebomb in your submarine

3416,"Born to rock around the clock
You cant say Im not
And in case you forgot
Im the king of rock
Im the devastating mic controller DMC
And cant nobody mess around with me
Im the king of rock rap and of rhyme
I deal what I feel and it feels fine
If the sound from the Jay then I wont play
Around with sound put down for the rhymes I say
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together lets rock
Hit it Run
You just watch your clock while I rock your spot
Im better known to the world as the king of rock
I like to speak my piece when Im on the mic
Im the best or at least Im the one you like
And when I serve you deserve to hear what I say
I throw a curve he got the nerve to make a triple play
Now how devastating can an MC be
My name is Darryl but you can call me D
Hit it Run
Its called gangsta hard rock nonstop hiphop
And its headed for the top by the rhymes I pop
For every race place color country county or creed
And all of the places that I emceed
Bboy badness to the highest degree
And you cant be a boy unless you be D
You cant bust a cherry or crush a grape
And if you aint got this tape youre in bad shape
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together lets Rock 
Do you really believe whats going on
I was conceived and I was born
I once was lost but now Im found
Tell your bunch Im boss I run this town
I leave all suckers in the dust
Those dumb motherfuckers cant mess with us
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together lets rock
Hit it Run
I was straight from the start performing art
Climbing up the chart while others fall apart
The three outlaws in the music trade
We wont rob but our job is to get paid Paid 
Cause Run has fun if Jay will play
As I add one more rhyme to say
Now how devastating can an MC be
My name is Darryl but you can call me D
Hit it Run
I was born son of Byford brother of Al
Bannahs my mamma and Runs my pal
Its McDaniels not McDonalds
These rhymes are Darryls the burgers are Ronalds 
I ran down my family tree
My mother my father my brother and D
RunDMC and Jam Master Jay

It wont be easy youll think its strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that Ive done
You wont believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although shes dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen I had to change
Couldnt stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Dont cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Dont keep your distance
And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
Theyre not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Dont cry for me Argentina
Dont cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Dont keep your distance
Have I said too much
Theres nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true

I rock on the mic from here to Bombay
I give it my best and say come what may

Gettin on like Ali bomaye
So fed up with racism today
Time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when its cloudy and gray

Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love youre in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive
Im taking doody rhymes to a brand new height
I shine on the mic like UltraBright
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap please say goodnight
Now heres a little something you may not like
My DJs name is Mix Master Mike
Its a real pity that you people got to bite
But I could understand because he sounds so nice
Reading you the news cause Im Country Mike
Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So I keep my mind still like the still of night
Now who in the world do you want to fight
Its against the system we should unite
Homophobics aint alright

Youre warned of the day
When youll be laid
Beneath the cold clay
The Angel of Death
Will come from the sky
And claim up your soul
When the time comes to die
When the Angel of Death
Comes down after you
Can you smile and say
That you have been true
Can you truthfully say
With your dying breath
That youre ready to meet
The Angel of Death
When the lights all grow dim
And the dark shadows creep
And then your lived ones
Are gathered to weep
Can you face them and say

1220,"City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she wont have to worry
Shell dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend whos feelin down
But he knows where shes goin as shes leavin
She is headed for the cheatin side of town
You cant hide your lyin eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now youd realize
There aint no way to hide your lyin eyes
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms they fall together
She whispers that its only for a while
She swears that soon shell be comin back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile
You cant hide your lyin eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now youd realize
There aint no way to hide your lyin eyes
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night its gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
Shes so far gone she feels just like a fool
My oh my you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well so carefully
Aint it funny how your new life didnt change things
Youre still the same old girl you used to be
You cant hide your lyin eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise

Kikiki mamama
Youre with your baby
And youre parked alone
On a summer night
Youre deep in love
But youre deeper in the woods
You think youre doin alright
Did you hear that voice
Did you see that face
Or was it just a dream
This cant be real
That only happens babe
On the movie screen
Oh but hes back
Hes the man behind the mask
And hes out of control
Hes back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole
Youre swimmin with your girl
Out on lovers lake
And the wind blows cold
It chills your bones
But youre still on the make
Thats a bad mistake
Ahh but the moon was full
And you had a chance
To be all alone
But youre not alone
This is your last dance
And your last romance
Yeah cause hes back
Hes the man behind the mask
And hes out of control

And he crawled out of his hole

3446,"Now theres a backseat lover thats always undercover
And I talk til my daddy say
Said You aint seen nothing til youre down on a muffin
And theres sure to be a change in ways
Now theres a cheerleader thats a real big bleeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss like this
Seesaw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air
Singing Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle
And they swinging like it just dont care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasnt me she was foolin cause she knew what was she was doin
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way talk this way She told me to 
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
Ooh like this
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee
It was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And they found they were looking at D
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady
Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss like this
Seesaw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing Hey diddle diddle with your kitty in the middle
I was swinging like I didnt care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasnt me she was foolin when she knew what she was doin
When she told me how to walk this way

He who lay down at the rich mans gate
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat

He was some mothers darlin he was some mothers son
Once he was fair and once he was young
And some mother rocked him her darlin to sleep

He shed his lifes blood for you and for me

And they left him to die like a tramp on the street

For a place to come in or bread from your store
Would you welcome him in or turn him away
Then the gods would deny you on the great judgment day

For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up first I regretted it then caught my rage
Like how could I not protect her from this awful phase
Never tried to hide who I was she was taught and raised
Like a princess but while Im on stage I cant leave her defenseless
Plus shes seen me switchin women Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin
So if her husband is a gangster cant be mad Ill love him
Never for her I want better homie in jail dead that
Wait til he come home you can see where his heads at
Niggas got game they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib plus Im sure he know who your father is
Although you real plus a honest kid
Dont think Im slow I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen I got a problem with it
She looked at me like Im not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin with it
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important
This morning I got a call nearly split my wig
This social network said Nas go and get your kid
Shes on Twitter I know she aint gon post no pic
Of herself underdressed no inappropriate shit right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she dont know what got inside this childs mind she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagramd it
At this point I realized I aint the strictest parent
Im too loose Im too cool with her
Shouldve drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school so she can get a balance
To public school theyre too nurture teen talents
They grow fast one day shes your little princess
Next day shes talkin boy business what is this
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back he makes us have precious little girls
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important
And I aint tryin to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It aint easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date he straight chip off his own papa
When she date we wait behind the door with a sawedoff
Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love

Waking up on Christmas morning hours before the winter suns ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean including heavens generosity
Peeping round the door to see what parcels are for free in curiosity
And Tommy doesnt know what day it is
He doesnt know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave
Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently and unaware of anything
Playing poxy pinball picks his nose and smiles and pokes his tongue at everything

Only if hes cured will his spirits future level ever heighten

Once I was a tumbling weed
Like a rolling stone cold and all alone
Living for the day my train would come
I never cared for school or any golden rules
Papa used to always say I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show them they was wrong
And headed out on the road singing my song
Then one sunny day The man he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of it was real
Money girls and cars and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so papa would see
When I went home to show em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
Oh such a sad song
First I got lost then I got found
But the ones that I love are in the ground
Papa I only wish you could see me now
Take a listen papa
Whoo I learnt how to play my guitar
Gonna be a superstar

And so I face the final curtain
You cunt Im not a queer
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
And each and every highway
And that much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
Ive planned each charted course
Each careful step along the highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
There were times
Im sure you knew
When there was fuck fuck
Fuck all else to do
But through it all
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced em all and the world
And did it my way
Ive loved and been a snide
Ive had my fill uh
My share of losing
And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I killed a cat
And might I say
Not in the die way
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way
For what is a brat
What has he got
When he wears hats
And he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I fucked no bloke
And did it my way

3046,"Yeah Im back off in this bitch one more time
To drop this rhyme about where my roots at
Yeah Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah GA is in the house so check it
February 1st 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack now hes gots responsibilities
Stayed at me grannys while me mammy was at work
And she couldnt watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home down in the Westside projects
Changin over foodstamps and hittin a lick was next see
Im just a playa like that my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white tshirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin or floatin a Brougham is what Im sportin
Sade is in my tape deck Im moving in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets thats where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts lickin leaves rolling reefer papers
Im slightly slouched in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave and the hoes they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
So follow the fiends follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
Its everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go head on with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because Im true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars you shit out of luck
Because the Westside aint taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
like that now like this and it dont quit and it dont stop 
Nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
and it dont stop and it dont quit its like that and ah 
See niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years so these niggas aint gone change
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearing furry Kangols so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your moneys spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as theres that tic tic followed by that bump
Im down to stick a ho if she got a Gstring
Cause the niggas in the Point aint changed man
You might call us country but wes only Southern
And I dont give a fuck PFunk spot to spark another
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
like that now like this and it dont quit and it dont stop 
Nine in my hand ounce in my crotch

538,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And its too hard to cross
And even though I know
The river is wide
I walk down every evening
And I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find
What Ive been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And Ive been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole
I dont know why I go walking at night
But now Im tired and I dont
Want to walk anymore
I hope it doesnt take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is
That Ive been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know Im searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
Im not sure about a life after this
God knows Ive never
Been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire
I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
Were all carried along
By the river of dreams

Gloria its not Marie 
",rest of my life Until I find what it is That Ive been looking for In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the jungle of doubt To a river so deep I know Im searching for something Something so undefined That it can only be seen By the eyes of the blind In the middle of the night Im not sure about a life after this God knows Ive never Been a spiritual man Baptized by the fire I wade into the river That runs to the promised land In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the desert of truth To the river so deep We all end in the ocean We all start in the streams Were all carried along By the river of dreams In the middle of the night Gloria its not Marie,In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep From the mountains of faith To a river so deep I must be looking for something Something sacred I lost But the river is wide And its too hard to cross And even though I know The river is wide I walk down every evening And I stand on the shore And try to cross to the opposite side So I can finally find What Ive been looking for In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the valley of fear To a river so deep And Ive been searching for something Taken out of my soul Something I would never lose Something somebody stole I dont know why I go walking at night But now Im tired and I dont Want to walk anymore I hope it doesnt take the
2843,"Ah yeah yo Ren yo ready to do this shit

Hey yo Yella Boy why dont you kick me one of them funky ass beats
Yo we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house
Yeah Comptons definitely in the house
Yo Ren what we gonna call this shit Tell em what yo name is
Yeah something like that
Alright lets kick this shit on the one
Kick it
Back by demand now its big as fuck
Because you as the public you should know whats up
Comptons in the House was more than gold it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that wed hit it
But that was a part of showbiz
Hey yo homeboy why dont you tell em what your name is
Well for the record its Ren and for the street its villain
And strapped with a gat its more like Matt Dillon
On Gunsmoke but not a man of the law
Im just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
See I peep and then I creep on a fool
Get my blood pressure high but still stay cool
Dig a grave of a nigga lookin up to me
That really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
Who was the man in the mask while I was waitin to ask
You know its MC Ren kickin mucho ass
Gettin respect in showbiz
Hey yo homeboy whats up
Why dont you tell em what your name is
Dre the motherfuckin doctor bitch hopper
The suckermotherfucker stopper
Back with a vocal track thats a fresh one
So now lets get the motherfuckin session
Goin flowin Its time to start throwin rhymes
So keep in mind all the suckers Im blowin
Cause Im a start showin the time
Never sayin Im the best and just goin for mine
Unlike a lotta suckers who claim theyre gettin busy
When their records only make good frisbees
You need to quit runnin off the mouth
Stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
Its not difficult in fact its kinda simple
To create something funky thats original
You either talkin bout the place to be
Who you are what you got or about a sucker MC
Oh yeah thats what Im talkin about Ren
You know what Im sayin
Yeah I know what youre sayin Dre but you still aint told em enough man
Alright alright
Well lets kick one more verse right here alright
Kick it
This is portable something to fuck with yo ear
Ren and Dre will appear when the sound is clear
To fuck it up like we always do and thats the trick
Sayin some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But its an everyday thang
Communicating to yall with the Compton slang
Comptons back in the house and your appartment
So open your door by the way so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel were gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin and shit now its a trip
Waitin for the grand finale or the end
Or stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren
Well like a kid we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin like hell as we move past the
Suckers the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Well were positive and theyre on a negative type
And if think were about to quit
Motherfucker you aint heard shit
Yeah that shit was funky you know what Im sayin Ren

You meet at certain dismal dull affairs
Centre of a crowd talking much too loud
Running up and down the stairs
Well it seems to me that you have seen
Too much in too few years
And though youve tried you just cant hide
Your eyes are edged with tears
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes here it comes here it comes here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
When you were a child you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your fathers still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax
You better stop

Well nothing I do dont seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse oh please
You were still in school when you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip I tried so hard
To rearrange your mind

You were disarranging mine

Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he wont be down on Wall Street
In the morning
He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesnt matter anymore

And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock

1852,"We met in the springtime
When blossoms unfold
The pastures were green
And the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower
As summer grew on
Her love like the leaves
Now has withered and gone
The roses have faded
Theres frost at my door
The birds in the morning
Dont sing anymore
The grass in the valley
Is starting to die
And out in the darkness
The whippoorwills cry
Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh please understand
Oh where has she gone to
Oh where can she be
She may have forsaken
Some other like me
She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow was a plaything
That she threw away
The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance
Is starting to bay
I wonder I wonder
What shes thinking of
Forsaken forgotten

731,"I got a sixtynine Chevy with a threeninersix
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
Shes waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the SevenEleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut em up and then we shut em down
Tonight tonight the strips just right
I wanna blow em off in my first heat
Summers here and the time is right
For racin in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Now some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
Then go racin in the street
Tonight tonight the strips just right
I wanna blow em all out of their seats
Were calling out around the world
Were going racin in the street
I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from LA
I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
But now theres wrinkles around my babys eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs Baby did you make it all right
She sits on the porch of her daddys house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shutdown strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me were gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the highways bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
Cause summers here and the time is right
For racin in the street

A nouse number with nouse people
If your life is on the line then youre dead today

Thats a body bag in disguise yall Ill betcha
I call em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation

And sometimes sing the blues
I twang metal and settle

Figured I was a bigger nigga
And they started to search me
So I headed West
Went to Cali a rally
Was for a brothers death
It was the fuzz who shot him
And not the bloods or cuzz
I wondered why it was like
So I just held my mic
But in my mind I was blind
So I just tried to find
A reason we was
Just the way that we was
So I just stayed in the crib
Until I got a buzz

1934,"How do you read a madmans mind
Teach me the art of war
For I shall bring more than you bargained for
Give me an ultimatum
That I could not dream of
Spills of a crying nation upon my soul
For I have not a mortal soul
That you already know
Look at my eyes
Theres no surprise
Ocean is black the devils track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born
Beyond the dark I feel the pain
Its hidden but I cant explain
A cross to bear a heavy faith
My sorrow whispers time again
I hear you calling my name
Come to claim my life again
Pray for me Im almost there
The pain almost too much to bear
I try to find my way back home
To feel the same again
The voice of nothing listened far too long
Little by little eat away
I think Ive lost my mind
Too late to change now what I left behind
Hear me listen my call
I am ready to fall
Lord hear me now
Let me go
Ocean is black the devils track
Looking beyond beneath the sea

517,"Viktor was born in the spring of 44
And never saw his father anymore
A child of sacrifice a child of war
Another son who never
Had a father after Leningrad
Went off to school
And learned to serve the state
Followed the rules
And drank his vodka straight
The only way to live was drown the hate
A Russian life was very sad
And such was life in Leningrad
I was born in 49
A cold war kid in McCarthy time
Stop em all at the 38th Parallel
Blast those yellow reds to hell
Cold war kids were hard to kill
Under their desks in an air raid drill
Havent they heard we won the war
What do they keep on fighting for
Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
Served out his time
Became a circus clown
The greatest happiness hed ever found
Was making Russian children glad
And children lived in Leningrad
Children lived in Levittown
Hid in the shelters underground
Until the Soviets turned their ships around
And tore the Cuban missiles down
And in that bright October sun
We knew our childhood days were done
And I watched my friends go off to war
What do they keep on fighting for
And so my child and I came to this place
To meet him eye to eye and face to face
He made my daughter laugh
Then we embraced
We never knew what friends we had
Until we came to Leningrad

2830,"The worlds most dangerous group
Once again beating on your motherfucking eardrums
Doing much damage for all you slutty ass hoes
Yo there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was good to GO for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest she was a hooker
So I took her a hundred yards to the boulevard
I told her Ill take care of you you take care of me
Youve got a PIMP and all I want is the money
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin
Yo she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like Medusa with titties full grown
One look and your dick turns to stone yeah
Keepin in mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows Im not to be fucked with
She aint crazy
Fuckin with Dre shell be pushin up daisies
She was the perfect ho but wouldnt you know
The bitch tried to gank me so
I had to kill her
Yeah straight hittin
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo I tied her to the bed I was thinking the worst
But yo I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the fortyfo yo
Then I straight smoked the ho
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess she figured
I was soft and she paid the cost to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
Shes outta here and thats how it turns out
Now Vicky Vicky Vicky shes very tricky
She put her hickey on top of my dick sick bitch see
She told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick weekly
I said Im with it but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin that I could fold up
We can do this she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo she wrote a check many a check
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin at the same game
All I wanted to do was get PAID
Just a little somethin for fuckin me
Yo Everything was cool but Vicky concerned me
Her husband was the District Attorney
So before he found out he was crossed up
By his bitch I was fuckin I had her tossed up
And put to sleep so a nigga never forgets
A dead bitch cant tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
Shes outta here and thats how it turned out
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about
Thinkin about money and lookin at a prostitute
The bitch was cute so now I had to execute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a steel trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin bigga
I think I had a flashback though
Cause I said fuck it
Loped and choked and smoked to the ho like this
Bitch its all about Dre
The money money money and this all I gotta say
Of course she came with me and remained with me
Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin that trick shit
Cause niggas knew that she was short one
A little later though she caught one
In the chest and I knew that it was commin
By who and how the all act would be done
So what One less bitch I gotta worry about
But that aint how it turned out
Yo there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the muthafuckin trigger and said I got her
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin her in the river with cement shoes
I knew my money was comin up short
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought shed never get caught
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with her other nigga countin my cash
I shouldve known she was like them other hoes
I told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin left but the shoes
I had up a nine so they couldnt refuse
I shot the nigga he was outta there
And tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin chair
Now theres one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out thats how it turns out
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about
In reality a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches
And all bitches are created equal
To me all bitches are the same
Moneyhungry scandalous groupie hoes
Thats always ridin on a niggas dick always in a niggas pocket
And when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind
To me ALL BITCHES AINT SHIT
One less
One less

Doesnt matter how old that i grow
Mothers love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me

But no one could ever take
Mothers love away

She taught me how to walk and talk and pray
Since shes gone on a heaven

And remember that theres no one in the word better than you
Thats why i miss my mother

Oohooh yeah ooh
Youre having a hard time and lately you dont feel so good
Youre getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
Its alright Its alright sometimes thats what it takes
Youre only human Youre allowed to make your share of mistakes Only human oohooh 
You better believe there will be times in your life
When youll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me youll learn more from your accidents
Than anything that you could ever learn at school
Dont forget your second wind
Sooner or later youll get your second wind
Oohooh yeah
Its not always easy to be living in this world of pain
Youre gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
Its alright Its alright though you feel your heart break
Youre only human Youre gonna have to deal with heartache
Youre only human 
Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone Oh oh oh oh 
Youre not the only one whos made mistakes
But theyre the only thing that you can truly call your own
Dont forget your second wind
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in
Youve been keeping to yourself these days
Cause youre thinking everythings gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
Til that old second wind comes along
Only human oohooh 
Only human 
You probably dont want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldnt be telling you if I hadnt been there myself
Its alright Its alright ssometimes thats what it takes hahaha
Were only human Were supposed to make mistakes Only human oohooh 
But I survived all those long lonely days Oh oh oh oh 
When it seemed I did not have a friend
Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could catch my breath and face the world again
Dont forget your second wind
Sooner or later youll feel that momentum kick in
One more time
Dont forget your second wind
Sooner or later youll feel that momentum kick in
Dont forget your second wind Only human oohooh 
Dont forget your second wind only human

45,"To Live and Die in LA Lyrics
Street Science youre on the air What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pacs new one
I love 2Pacs new record
Right but dont you feel like that creates tension between East and West I mean hes talking about killing people I had sex with your wife and not in those words But hes talking about I wanna see you deceased
I love LA
No Doubt
To live and die in LA California 
No matter what you say about Los Angeles
Its still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California
To live and die in LA
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash so its hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark
Cold part about it nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin to floss on him blind to a broken mans dream
A hard lesson court cases keep me guessin
Plea bargain aint an option now so Im stressin
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin money off of cuss words writin again
Learn how to think ahead so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset likin the sin
Whats the worst they can do to a nigga
Got me lost in Hell to live and die in LA on bail
My angel sing
To live and die in LA its the place to be
And the angels go
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in LA
To live and die in LA its the place to be
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Its the city of angels and constant danger
South Central LA cant get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watchin the ghetto bird helicopters
I observe so many niggas gettin three strikes tossed in jail
I swear the pen right across from hell
I cant cry cause its on now
Im just a nigga on his own now
Livin life thug style so I cant smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code Bs and Cs
All them other niggas copycats these is Gs
I love Cali like I love women
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of thug in em
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this well burn this bitch down get us pissed
To live and die in LA
To live and die in LA its the place to be
Let my angels sing
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in LA its the place to be
To live and die in LA
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
It wouldnt be LA without Mexicans
Black love Brown Pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin to see us all broke
Im on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY Weekends Crenshaw MLK
Automatics rang free niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown nigga love yo hood
But recognize and its all good
Where the weed at Niggas gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mufucka permed out
MOB Big Suge in the LoLo bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone Tre Heron Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked but this ones for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel hopin it pay
Gettin high watchin time fly to live and die in LA
To live and die in LA its the place to be
Let my angel sing
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go

Is that really your reflection in there
I just want to jump into the warm depths and be there with you one more time
Oh alright
Hit it boys
My initials sprayed across a pavement
Cut into your private interview
Talk to me now step into my room
Well have a word or two
If I ever had a million dollars
And if I didnt give it all to you
Would you lose interest show me indifference
Foot in another shoe
Not very high heels
Not wearing sneakers too
A magazine ad a printed canvas
A basic new shade blue suede shoe
Thought Id like to have a little party
Thought Id like to have a little do
Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment
Honey heres looking at you
Ill stop my drinking give you my promise true
Clean out the closet be existential

Nothing that Id rather do

4636,"One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didnt last
Now Romeo you know I cant believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right next time
Thats the end of me
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Dont want to hear about Susan
Shes got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
No no no no no get it right 
Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same
Now Romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say goodbye to me boy
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Dont want to hear about Susan

You know the kind of girl
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame

2806,"I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the Drop
Cause her son caught the slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straightup man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga to run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack the fact
And take that shit back
Cause they dont wanna fuck with that
Theres too many niggas theyre trying to calm
If motherfuckers could get it nobody wouldve fucked with it
Appetite for Destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
Murder in the first degree and manslaughter
Taking the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked up
And the niggas is killing its straight fucked up
Whoever saying what Im sayings for greed
Then I aint even what theyre trying to feed
My appetite for destruction
You guys know who Im talking to
The appetite is tremendous so Im gonna spin this
Drop up some violence cause they asked me to end this
Some trouble that I caught cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
He took a swing for my head thought I was faded
Started running for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the nine went Bang
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
Cause Im a nigga you cant sleep on
So set the alarm cause I hit like a motherfucking bomb
I do damage with the nine in my hand
But the average nigga that dont know me dont understand
Im from the streets so therefore
You know I dont care for a sucker that aint down
With the real niggas the niggas the niggas
Yo and thats the way shit gotta go aint even sober
Any time that the nine wanna leave
I got a 38 hidden up the sleeve
And its ready to go to war cause thats what its here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And thats the million and one they couldnt hang with the appetite cause they wasnt rapping right
So I had to destroy whoever was standing in my presence
For fucking up the essence
Appetite for Destruction
Cops put a hurting on your ass man
You know they really degrade you
White folks dont believe that shit
They dont believe that cops degrade you
Oh come on those people those people are resisting arrest
Check it out yall in the house yall
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So wont you ease on down to the yellow brick road
To Compton but first let me tell you something
I possess the Ten Commandments of the hiphop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer
First One Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your motherfucking neck
Second One Always gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy go snap crackle and pop
Number Three Im a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryna cause some static
Number Four Heres whats in store
A crazyass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth One My killing has begun
I pull out my gun thatll keep me on the run
Step Six Hmmm its kinda tricky
Cant forget that Im motherfucking chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E
By the time you get to seven youll be six feet deep
Number Eight Make no mistake
Move real sneaky and youre bound to catch your prey
Ninth One I gotta be raw
Fuck any brainwashing manmade law
Last but not least I must be real
Number Ten is my appetite to kill

Just let me be great
Let me be great
I feel like mothafuckin Cassius Clay right now
Genius
Dont be good my nigga be great
After that government cheese we eating steak
After the projects now we on estates
Im from the bottom I know you can relate
Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream Hov got a team
My chain already heavy dont let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush confetti on my fur
Turn right in Rutland niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
Im just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1 of a billion more than niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like its an everyday thing clean
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the uhh
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the lowlow
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murdered Malcolm gave Cassius the shakes
Wait tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know Im gon shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy basking on top
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Lets fuck up the world
Fuck up the uhh
Sipping DUSS boy this aint your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac me Im in the Maybach
This aint grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got strip clubs feeling like Oxford I swear
Teacherteacher Im trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught yall they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere you in the HOVs
Jordan 1s and dungarees
And thats just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
til we all check a billion shit its just the way Im feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling we just top what we top
Cause the bars dont struggle when the struggle dont stop

Faded dreams and nuclear fission span

The strings of theory hide in the human race

Cause Im a poor boy

Shot her dead when your heart exploded
Tell me baby now ddontcha worry

I swear I didnt know that 45 was loaded
In fact my memory aint too clear
Thats not to say she didnt get what she deserved
Least thats the way it look from here
Boy when you line the track a lack a
Hey boy dont you line the track
Oh a love come tumblin down
Oh a love come tumblin down
Oh Lets get outta here 
When a love come tumblin
And every night she take her thing
Into the city and in the mornin make me beg
Cause If Id taken all her real titty gritty
Id smack her right upside the head boy

Im just cut from a different cloth
And they dont make this fabric no more
That money coming Im grabbin it all
Triple beam leaning still balancing raw
Still got the white Macklemore
Car seat smelling like I just ripped the packing off
Run down on me in traffic Im backin em off
Sex money and murder mastered it all
Shout out to my macs but Im Billy though
Still on that gangland shit really though
Got a couple locs that Im close with
And theyll Shmurda dance on your whole shit
Free Bobby free Rowdy free the whole 9
Free Duski free Chewie free my old Ys
Act up we at your neck like bowties
Belly shit bringing niggas gifts in a whole 9
Might send your woman crush on a road trip
That pussy stuffed with a whole brick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
Buy it by the pounds smoking by the zip
Buy em by the rounds shoot em by the clip
Everybody down everybody hit
I said everybody down everybody hit
Nowadays the game full of lames and straight gays
Niggas throwing shade and hate from a fake page
Niggas catfishing for asswhippings
Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death blood on this Raf Simons
Fiends like Santana where you at with it
Back like cooked crack yall done gave too many bad fixes
Looking at my Rollie its bout that time yo
Extended clip have your whip jumping like pot holes

Times up mine go hit em with the Young MA flow

No I think its time I let these niggas know so
They cant fuck with me and they know so
Im out here rocking Gucci like its Polo

They know I got that spice that Adobo
And Im still selling coke tho
Let me stop you niggas cops Robo
My nigga Black an animal stay on go mode
Bounce keep the tre cinco ocho
Chewie coming home they like oh no
Cause they know how he playing with that 45
Aint talkin weed when I tell my niggas blow smoke
Aint talkin rain when I say youll get your clothes soaked
Watch my name when you rap might get your throat choke
Might tell your bitch to come over get these slow pokes
She gon get each and every one of her holes poked

Doing anything my radio advised
With every one of those late night stations

They really think were getting out of control

But they dont give you any choice
Cause they think that its treason

You better listen to the radio

Here in Savannah its pouring rain
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
Will you still love me when I call you up when I get back to town
I know that youve got all those pretty girls coming on
Hanging on your boomboompachyderm
Will you tell those girls that youve got German Measles
Honey tell them youve got germs
I hope youll be thinking of me because Ill be thinking of you
While Im traveling home alone
Tell those girls that youve got Joni shes coming back home
Ive got road maps from two dozen states
Ive got coast to coast just to contemplate
Will you still love me when I get back to town
Its funny how these old feelings hang around
You think theyre gone no no they just go underground
Will you still love me when I get back to LA town
You and me were like America and Russia
Were always keeping score
Were always balancing the power
And that can get to be a cold cold war
Were going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
In some neutral caf
You lay down your sneaking round the town honey
And Ill lay down the highway

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will its just a question of when
Ive lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that wont happen to us
Cause its always been a matter of trust
I know youre an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
But I cant offer you proof
But youre gonna face a moment of truth
Its hard when youre always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
Its a matter of trust
You cant go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for Gods sake dont shut me out
This time youve got nothing to lose
You can take it you can leave it whatever you choose
I wont hold back anything
And Ill walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
Its make believe until its only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust
Im sure youre aware love
Weve both had our share of
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong
Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After youve heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But that cant happen to us
Cause its always been a matter of trust
Its a matter of trust
Its always been a matter of trust

But I just cant have my way
And Im afraid to go to sleep
Because tomorrow is today
People tell me life is sweeter
But I dont hear what they say
Nothing comes to change my life
So tomorrow is today
I dont care to know the hour
Because its passing anyway
I dont have to see tomorrow
Because I saw it yesterday
So I listen for an answer
But the feeling seems to stay
And whats the use of always dreaming
If tomorrow is today
Still Im waiting for the morning
But it feels so far away
And you dont need the love Im giving
So tomorrow is today
Oh my Im going to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me
Make my bed Im gonna lie in it
If you dont come Im sure gonna die in it
Too late too much giving
Ive seen a lot of life
And Im damn sick of living it
I keep hoping that you will pass my way
And someday if your dreams are leaving you
Ill still believe in you

And although my hands still play
Soon enough it will all be over because

3962,"Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat acourtin
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below
I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly
My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his teardimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly

2194,"It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row
A crime for which I am totally innocent you know
I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolleys wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way Im yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And Im not afraid to die
I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least thats what Im told
My killhands
Tatooed EVIL across its brothers fist
That filthy five They did nothing to challenge or resist
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which Im told
All history does unfold
Its made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way Im yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And Im not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way Im hopin
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way there was no proof
And Im not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way Im hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And Ive got nothing left to loose
And Im not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way thats helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way I told the truth
But Im afraid I told a lie

Seven seas that run high
All those things that dont change come what may

Then Im bound for movin on
Ill look for you if Im ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are lookin good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do

The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration

Beside the garden wall when stars are bright
You are in my arms

A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain

A distant planet from where I come

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin my mind
Seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
In between
What I find is pleasin and Im feelin fine
Love is so confusing theres no peace of mind
If I fear Im losin you its just no good
You teasin like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing but I was so blind

Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
Im the one youre usin please dont push me aside
We couldve made it cruisin yeah

3157,"Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin on first theyre guilty now theyre gone
Yeah Ill check out a movie
But itll take a Black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this TV
All this news and views are beneath me
So all I hear about is shots ringing out
About gangs putting each others head out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas lets go hang out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things Ill never forget yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn
Ice Cube is down with the PE
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big Daddy is smooth word to mother
Lets check out a flick that exploits the color
Roaming through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb getting played like a sucker
Dont fight the power gunshot the motherfucker
As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard
Thinking how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portraying the roles
Of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
Many intelligent Black men seemed
To look uncivilized when on the screen
Like I guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation what else can a nigga do
And Black women in this profession
As for playing a lawyer out of the question
For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So lets make our own movies like Spike Lee
Cause the roles being offered dont strike me
As nothing that the black man could use to earn
Burn Hollywood burn
Now were considering you for a part in our new production How do you feel about playing a controversial negro
Yeah Im wid it You mean somebody like Huey P Newton or H Rap Brown right
Well its a servant character that chuckles a little bit and sings
Yo man what Thats bullshit
Hey Cube Kane Flav listen I hope you aint wastin my time You know how I feel about givin these movies my money know what Im sayin I work hard for it

4343,"Candy screen wrappers of silkscreen fantastic
Requiring memories
Both lovely and guilt free
Lurid and lovely with twilight of ages
Luscious and lovely and filthy with laughter
Laconic giggles
Ennui fort the passions
In order to justify most spurious desires
Rectify moments
Most serious and urgent
To hail upon the face of most odious time
Requiring replies most facile and vacuous
With words nearly singed
With the heartbeat of passions
Spew forth with the grace of a tart going under
Subject of great concern
Noble origin
Denigrate obtuse and active verbs pronouns
Skewer the sieve of optical sewer
Release the handle that holds all the gates up
Puncture the eyeballs that seep all the muck up
Read all the books and the people worth reading
And still see the muck on the sky of the ceiling
Please raise the flag
Rosy red carpet envy
English used here
Is messenger is nervous
Its no fun at all
Out here in the hall
Mister moonlight
Succulent smooth and gorgeous
Isnt it nice
Were number One and so forth
Isnt it sweet
Being unique
For screeching and yelling and various offenses
Lower the queen and bend her over the tub
Against the state the country the committee
Hold her head under the water please for an hour
For groveling and spewing and various offenses
Puncture the bloat with the wing of a sparrow
The inverse the obverse the converse the reverse
The sharpening wing of the edge of a sparrow
For suitable reckonings too numerous to mention
As the queen is fat she is devoured by rats
There is one way to skin a cat
Or poison a rat it is hetero
Four hear to three forthrightly stated
Relent
And obverse
And inverse
And perverse
And reverse
The inverse
Of perverse

And chop it
And pluck it
And cut it
And spit it
And sew it
To joy
On the edge
Of a cyclops
And spinet it
To rage
On the edge
Of a cylindrical minute
Put down that rag
Simpering callow and morose
Who let you in
If I knew then I could get out
The murder you see
Is a mystery to me
Dear Mister Muse
Fellow of wit and gentry
Medieval ruse
Filling the shallow and empty
Fools that duel
Duel in pools
To Rembrandt and Oswald
To peanuts and ketchup
Sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
Up to the stand with your foot on the bible
As king I must order and constantly arouse
If you swear to catch up and throw up and up up
A king full of virgin kiss me and spin it
Excuse to willow and wander dark wonders
Divest me of robessutures Harry and pig meat
The fate of a nation rests hard on your bosoms
The king on his throne puts his hand down his robe
The torture of inverse and silk screen and Harry
And set the tongue squealing the reverse and inverse
Tantalize poets with visions of grandeur
Their faces turn blue with the reek of the compost
As the living try hard to retain what the dead lost
With double dead sickness from writing at what cost
And business
And business
And reverse
And reverse
And set the brain reeling
The inverse
And perverse
Objections suffice
Apelike and tactile bassoon
Oboeing me
Cordon the virus section
Off to the left
Is what is not right
English arcane
Tantamount here to frenzy
Passing for me
Lascivious elder passion
Corpulent filth
Disguised as silk
Contempt contempt and contempt for the boredom
I shall poison the city and sink it with fire
For Cordless and Harry and Apepig and Scissor
The messengers wig seems fraught with desire
For blueberry picnics and pincenez and magpies
The messengers skirt would you please hook it higher
For children and adults all those under ninety
How truly disgusting Would you please put it down
A stray in this fray is no condom worth saving
As king Im quite just but its just quite impossible
A robe and a robe and a robe and a bat
No double class inverse could make lying worth dying
With cheap simian melodies
Hillbilly outgush
For illiterate ramblings
For cheap understanding
For mass understanding
The simple
The inverse
The compost
The reverse
The obtuse
And stupid
And business
And business
And cheap stupid lyrics
And simple mass reverse
While the real thing is dying
Exit the pig
Enter the Owl and Gorgeous
King on the left
It on the right and primping
Adjusting his nose
As he reads from his scroll
Folksy knockwurst
Peel back the skin of French and
What do you find
Follicles intertwinning
Succulent prose
Wrapped up in robes
Off with his head
Take his head from his neck off
Requiring memories both lovely and guiltfree
Put out his eyes then cut his nose off
Sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
Scoop out his brain
Put a string where his ears were
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Swing the whole mess at the end of the wire
Scratch out his eyes with the tip of a razor
Let the wire extend from the tip of a rose
Caroline Caroline Caroline Oh
But retains the remnants of what once was a nose
Pass me my robe
Fill my bath up with water
Jumpsuit and pig meat
And making his fortune
While making them happy
With the inverse and obverse
And making them happy
And making them happy
With the coy and the stupid
Just another dumb lackey
Who puts out one thing
While singing the other
But the real things alone
And it is no mans brother
No one knows
No nose is good news and senseless
Extend the wine
Drink here a toast to selfless
Ten year old port
Is perfect in court
Safety is nice
Not an unwise word spoken
Scary bad dreams
Made safe in lovely songs
No doom or gloom
Allowed in this room
Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
Cascade and Cyanide Rachaminoff Beethoven
Skull silly wagon and justice and perverse
And reverse the inverse and inverse and inverse
Blueberry catalog questionable earnings
Hustlers lament and the rest will in due cry
To battle and scramble and browbeat and hurt
While chewing on minstrels and choking on dirt
Disease please seems the order of the day
Please the king please the king please the king day
Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
Point of order return the king here to the ceiling
Oh not to be whistled
Or studied or hummed or
Remembered at nights
When the I is alone
But to skewer and ravage
And savage and split
With the grace of a diamond bellicose wit
To stun and to stagger with words as such stone
That those who do hear cannot again return home
Razzamatazz
Theres nothing on my shoulder
Lust is a must
Shaving my heads made me bolder
Will you kindly read
What it was I brought thee
Hello to Ray
Hello to Godiva and Angel
Who let you in
Isnt it nice
The party
Arent the lights
Pretty at night
Sick leaf and sorrow and pincers not scissors
Regard and refrain from the daughters of marriage
Regards for the elders and youngest in carriage
Regard and regard for the inverse and perverse
And obverse and diverse of reverse and reverse
Regard from the sick the dumb and the camel
From pumps storing water like brain is to marrow
Xray and filthy and cutting and then peeling
To skin and to skin and to bone and to structure
To livid and pallid and turgid and structured
And structured and structured and structured and structured
And regard and refrain and regard and refrain
The sick and the dumb inverse reverse and perverse
Contempt contempt and contempt for the seething
For writhing and reeling and twobit reportage
For sick with the body and sinister holy
The drown burst blue babies now dead on the seashore
The valorous horseman who hang from the ceiling
The pig on the carpet the dusty pale jissom
That has no effect for the sick with the seesaw
The inverse obverse converse reverse of inverse
The diverse and converse of reverse and perverse
And sweet pyrotechnics and lets have another
Of inverse converse diverse perverse and reverse
Hells graveyard is damned as they chew on their brains
The slick and the scum reverse inverse and perverse
Plowing while its done away
Dumb and ready pig meat
Sick upon the carpet
Climb into the casket
Safe within the parapet
Sack is in the parapet
Pigs are out and growling
Slaughter by the seashore
See the lifeguard drowning
Sea is full of fishes
Fishes full of china
China plates are falling
All fall down
Sick and shiny carpet
Lie before my eyeseyes
Lead me to the ceiling
Walk upon the wallwall
Tender as the green grass
Drink the whisky horror
See the young girls dancing
Flies upon the beaches
Beaches are for sailors
Nuns across the seawall
Black hood horseman raging
Swordsman eating fire
Fire on the carpet
Set the house ablazing
Seize and bring it flaming
Gently to the groundground
Dizzy Bell Miss Fortune
Fat and full of lovejuice
Drip it on the carpet
Down below the fire hose
Weep and whisky fortune
Sail me to the moon dear
Drunken dungeon sailors
Headless Roman horsemen
The king and queen are empty
Their heads are in the outhouse
Fish upon the water
Bowl upon the saviour
Toothless wigged Laureate
Plain and full of fancy
Name upon a letterhead
Impressing all the wheat germ
Love you for a nickel
Maul you for a quarter
Set the casket flaming
Do not go gentle blazing
Sick upon the staircase
Sick upon the pulpit
Blood upon the pillow
Climb into the parapet
See the church bells gleaming
Knife that scrapes a sick plate
Dentures full of air holes
The tailor couldnt mend straight
Shoot her full of air holes
Climbing up the casket
Take me to the casket
Teeth upon her red throat
Screw me in the daisies
Rip upon her holler
Snip the seas fantastic
Treat her like a sailor
Full and free and nervous
Out to make his fortune
Either this or that way
Sickly or in good health
Piss upon a building
Like a dog in training
Teach to heel or holler
Yodel on a sing song
Down upon the carpet
Tickle polyester
Sick within the parapet
Screwing for a dollar
Sucking on a firehose
Chewing on a rubber line
Tied to chairs and rarebits
Pay another player
Oh youre such a good lad
Heres another dollar
Tie him to the bedpost
Sick with witches covens
Craving for a raw meat
Bones upon the metal
Sick upon the circle
Down upon the carpet
Down below the parapet
Waiting for your bidding
Pig upon the carpet
Tumenescent railroad
Neuroanaesthesia analog
Ready for a good look
Drooling at the birches
Swinging from the birches
Succulent Nebraska

1705,"Back in NYC Lyrics
I see faces and traces of home
Back in New York City huh
So you think Im a tough kid
Is that what you heard
Yeah well I like to see some action
And it gets into my blood
They call me the trail blazer
Rael electric razor
Im the pitcher in a chain gang
We dont believe in pain
Cause were only as strong
Yes were only as strong
As the weakest link in the chain
Let me out of Pontiac
When I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me
If you know what I mean what I mean
Aaaah You say I must be crazy
Cause I dont care who I hit who I hit
But I know its me thats hitting out
And Im Im not full of shit
I dont care who I hurt
I dont care who I do wrong
This is your mess Im stuck in
I really dont belong
When I take out my bottle
Filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where Rael has been has been

304,"Listen dear
I realise that youve been hurt deep
Because Ive been there
But regardless to who what why when and where
Were all precious in his sight
And a rose is still and always will be a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
There was a rose I knew I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth hey hey
She never knew what hit her oh
Steal her honey then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn tryin to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power what I am is what I am 
Now believe me when I tell you that Ive been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you its you nobody else
And now youre so tough tryin to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin and flossin tryin to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh oh yeah
When she gets nearer
Shes cryin you cant hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn tryin to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl you hold the power what I am is what I am 
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power what I am is what I am 
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see youre lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Dont believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl love yourself enough to know
That without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
And without him your life goes on
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl you hold the power what I am is what I am 
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power what I am is what I am

Plane crash
Yeah Illa Illa Illa 
Yo Im just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin face right now
Yeah
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate Im bout to break it down
Aint no mistakes allowed but make no mistake Im bout
To rape the alphabet I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out Brrr 
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but aint thinkin bout no bank account
But bitch Im off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker shut the fuck up when Im talkin lil bitch
Im sorry wait whats your talent Oh critiquin
My talent Oh bitch I dont know who the fuck yall are
To give a subpar bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me millions of views attention in news
I mention you loselose for me winwin for you
Billions of views your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks but bitch you just lit the fuse
Dont get misconstrued business as us
Shitlist renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed cause I just dont get
What the fuck half the shit is that youre listenin to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though Probly no
Get this fuckin audio out my Audi yo adis
I can see why people like Lil Yachty but not me though
Not even dissin it just aint for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe Stan just isnt your cup of tea Get it 
Maybe your cups full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill
I should eat a pill probably I will
Old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror I dont see my breath
Possibly Im dead I must be possessed
Like an evil spell Im EVIL Evil spelled 
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that Id rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch Fuck my side chick 
You wont ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the MIC
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick Yeah 
Turn down for what
I aint loud enough nah turn the Valium up Illa Illa Illa 
Cause I dont know how Im gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesnt matter what caliber
I spit at Ill bet a hundred thousand bucks
Youll turn around and just be like Man how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks
And now he wants to take it out on us Ooouuu 
But last week an exfan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
Itll help me get back to myself and shell love me Ooouuu 
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
Id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me NFing 
So fingerbang chicken wang MGK Igg Azae
Lil Pump Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game pick a name
Im fed up with bein humble
And rumor is Im hungry Im sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbojumbo
The era that Im from will pummel you thats what its comin to
What the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it
Im gonna crumble you and Ill take a number two
And dump on you if you aint Joyner
If you aint Kendrick or Cole or Sean then youre a goner
Im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonalds
But if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But yall are actin like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin I no longer got it
Cause you missed a line and never caught it
Cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it
Cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist
And Im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What Ill never be is flawless all Ill ever be is honest Illa Illa Illa 
Even when Im gone theyre gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldnt bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that Ima hit my bottom
If I dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I dont see why yall even started with me
I get in beefs my enemies die
I dont cease fire til at least all are deceased
Im east side never be caught slippin
Now you see why I dont sleep not even a wink I dont blink
I dont doze off I dont even nod to the beats
I dont even close my fuckin eyes when I sneeze
Aw man That BET cypher was weak it was garbage
The Thing aint even orangeoh my God thats a reach
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine or you think water is pink
Dawg thats a date Looks like an olive to me
Look theres an apple No its not its a peach
So fingerbang Pootie Tang
Burger King Gucci Gang dookie dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesnt matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But Im gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch Yeah 
Invite em in like a One A Day
Im not done Preach 
Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand was it even worth it
Cause the way I see people turnings
Makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose
Im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin to do the right thing but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined
Cause Im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back Id at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that hes deserted
But I think its workin
These verses are makin him a wee bit nervous
And hes too scurred to answer me with words
Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least hes heard it
Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin him
Or ask if Im linked to terrorists
I said Only when it comes to ink and lyricists
But my beef is more media journalists
Hold up hold up hold up 
I said my beef is more meaty a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes I mean eating a penis
Cause theyve been pannin my album to death
So Ive been givin the media fingers
Dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But theyve been puttin me through the ringer
So I aint ironin shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

3555,"Let us be lovers well marry our fortunes together
Ive got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs Wagner pies
And walked off to look for America
Kathy I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
Ive gone to look for America
Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said Be careful his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette I think theres one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
Kathy Im lost I said though I knew she was sleeping
Im empty and aching and I dont know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
Theyve all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America
